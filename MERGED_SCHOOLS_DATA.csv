CASE ABSTRACT
The researchers conducted a study entitled Customer Satisfaction of
Lifestar Family Karaoke. The study aims to evaluate the customer satisfaction
of Lifestar Family Karaoke for its Customer Service and Physical Environment
of the lobby, KTV rooms and receiving area in terms of spatial layout,

functionality, and ambient conditions.

To evaluate the customer satisfaction of Lifestar Family Karaoke, a
descriptive research method and purposive-convenience sampling technique
was used in gathering the data. A modified questionnaire was also developed
and used a frequency distribution table using weighted mean. The study was
conducted from April 2017 to May 2017. The result of the evaluation showed
that the Physical Environment of Receiving Area of Lifestar got the highest
weighted mean satisfied; which meets customers’ expectation while the three
areas got less satisfied, which is below customers’ expectation, specifically for
the Physical environment of the Lobby, Physical Environment of KTV Rooms,
and Customer Service. For the Physical Environment of the Lobby, they
should add LED lights around the dining area, for the Physical Environment of
the KTV Rooms, they should strictly implement the standard procedure in
spraying the air freshener and the employees should wait for 2 — 5 minutes
before letting the customer in, so that the scent of the air freshener would not
be as strong and irritating. For the customer service, they should strictly
implement their standard in greeting customers and put up sanctions for those

employees that fail to follow standard procedures and the employees should

Case Overview

On the first year, May 201 3-April 2014, the owner established standard
procedures and protocols regarding its physical environment and customer
service.

The KTV rooms of Lifestar Family Karaoke have noise insulation to
reduce passage of sound from one room to another. The KTV rooms have
two lighting options to choose from, the warm light bulb lighting or the disco
ball lighting with three settings. Before the customers enter the KTV room, the
employees must turn on the air conditioner and spray the room with air

freshener.

Aside from the KTV rooms, they also have a receiving area where the
customer can order, pay, and inquire for vacant rooms. The receiving area
has a sofa for customers to sit comfortably while waiting and is air
conditioned. The employees also play pop music playlists on the receiving
area. Regarding the lighting, they use white fluorescent light bulbs and mini
LED lights in violet and blue colors. A display case of expensive and imported

liquors can also be seen.

Lifestar also has a lobby; the lobby has tables and chairs for dining and
drinking, a mini stage for live band performances, and a big window which
allows light to come in; by the window, is the smoking area where there are
two chairs, a table, and an ashtray. The mini-stage has two microphones and
a sound system. The mini-stage is decorated with Gina cloth. The lobby has
no air conditioning. The lobby has blue LED light bulbs in each corner and

disco laser lights which emit blue, green, and red lights while the hallway has

dim lighting of blue, red, and green.

The employees must also clean the external area (street parking) and
internal (KTV rooms, lobby, receiving area, hallway, and kitchen) before and
after opening. Regarding the speed of service, when the customers are
finished with their orders, the employee must prepare the drinks immediately
and inform the kitchen staff (if they ordered food). They must also update the
customer the time that they must wait. They must also know the product,
price, and promotion of Lifestar to be able to respond to inquiries as well as
suggest. They must also know how to operate all of the equipment (KTV
machine, digital recording studio, television, sound system, microphone,
Xbox, and air conditioner). The technician also updates the song lists every
three months in the KTV room. In regards to responding to customer
complaints, the employees must do these right away: listen to the customer's
complaint, apologize, and provide a solution. Regarding the customer service
standard procedures and protocols, the employees must greet the customer
when they walk in and refer them as sir/ ma’am. For example: “Welcome to
Lifestar ma’am.” Employees must also pay attention what the customer wants
and be polite and respectful. Regarding the employees’ uniform, they are

required to wear pants, closed shoes, and a shirt provided by Lifestar.

Lifestar has a service bell in each KTV rooms. The service bell is used

by the customers to inform the employees that they need help. When the

customer rings the bell, it automatically sends a notification of the room's

name to the receiving area; an employee will then go to that room.

The customers leave their comments, suggestions, and complaints in
the suggestion box and Lifestar's Facebook page. On the first year, according
to the suggestion box and Facebook page messages, the customers
appreciated that the employees are always wearing their uniform and closed
shoes and that they also greet them lively. They also said that the area and
KTV rooms were clean. The customers complained that sometimes the
employees forget to spray the air freshener after the previous customers

finished using the rooms. The sales during that year were Php 4,591,280.

On the second year, May 2014-April 2015, they renovated the lobby
area but they still operated during the renovation. After the renovation, what
used to be a mini stage was turned into a mini bar, an extra space for dining
was also made above the stairs, and the open window was turned into a
stage. The mini bar displays the different drinks that Lifestar offer, it also has
two stools and a counter top. The stage, used for live band performances and
open mics; has noise insulation, two microphones, two chairs, and a sound
system. A microphone is placed on the stage during an Open Mic, when
customers want to sing karaoke songs. Across the stage, is a LED flat screen
television, where singers and customers can see the lyrics of the song during
the Open Mic. Employees play music videos on the television when there are
no live bands and open mics. The lobby still has table and chairs for dining

and drinking. The lobby is air conditioned and the smoking area is outside the

entrance door of Lifestar. The smoking area has a sofa and an ashtray.
Regarding the lighting, they use disco lights and laser lights which emit green,
red, and blue colors. When there are only a few customers in the area, the air

conditioner is turned off and only the wall fan is turned on.

The protocol in cleaning the KTV was changed; employees must clean
the KTV room before and after the customers enter the room and not just
before the opening of the KTV bar. The employee turns on the air conditioner
of the room and then sprays each corner with air freshener, two to five
minutes before the customers enter the room. Employees are still required to
wear pants and closed shoes but instead of shirt provided by Lifestar, they

color code their t-shirts. Example, on Monday they wear pink.

That year, the service bell stopped working which causes the customer
to go to the receiving area when they need help. On the second year,
according to the suggestion box and Facebook messages, the customer
noticed a change that they started to clean the rooms before and after
customers used it and they appreciated it. They also commented on Lifestar’s
renovation that they liked the new stage and the open mic but they still
preferred the brightness of the light on the previous year, they also
commented on atmosphere and said it was hot in the lobby because they will
turn off the air condition if there were only a few customers. The employees
were not wearing their color-coded uniform and they did not greet the
Customers. The sales during that year were: Php 3,021,659. The sales

decreased compared from the previous year.

On the third year, May 2015 - April 2016, nothing has changed with
Lifestar’s standard procedures and a protocol regarding its customer service

and physical environment and the service bell is still not working.

On the third year, according to the suggestion box and Facebook
messages, the customer found their equipment has good performance; they
liked the sound quality of the microphones as well as the sound system. They
also felt that the television in the lobby is just the right size and has a nice
resolution that makes it easy for them to see the lyrics from the stage. They
liked that the song lists were always updated. They liked that it contains
popular songs of different genres. They noticed that Lifestar’s employees
rarely greet them when they get in or do not even ask for repeat business.
The lack of friendly greeting from the employees gave them the impression
that the employees are not approachable. They said that not greeted by the
employees can put them in a bad mood and they will feel unimportant and
ignored. The customers also observed that the employees were not wearing
the uniform. They also commented on the strong scents on the rooms
because employees spray the room just right after they come in. They also
felt that instead of getting rid of the odor of the room, the smell of the air
freshener just mixes with the odor. They also complained about the hot
temperature in the lobby area. The customer observed that the employees
were not reliable with the time they promise to deliver the products; they also
noticed that they have slow service during peak hours. For example, instead

of five (5) minutes promise time, they will wait fifteen to twenty (15-20)

HDS Building, 999 J.C. Aquino Avenue, Butuan City

CASE ABSTRACT

Evaluation on Inventory Management of Angging Dry Goods Store in
Buenavista, Agusan del Norte was assessed. There were areas subjected to
the study (forecasting, ordering and controlling) to help the management
change their traditional way of inventory management. The study used the
descriptive method of research and a purposive-complete enumeration
sampling method. About 8 respondents were analyzed that includes the store
manager, cashier, six sales ladies. Results showed that in evaluating the
inventory management of the store, forecasting, ordering and controlling has
a weighted mean of 2.40, 2.80, and 1.43, respectively. In terms of forecasting,
the management lacks knowledge in forecasting that causes them to have
incorrect forecasting of the demand. In ordering, the management does not
have a reorder point for their inventory which causes them to order stocks
always from their suppliers. In controlling, the management lacks control over
its inventory and failed to follow any standard practices. It was concluded that
the areas mentioned above contributed to the increasing number of slow-
moving stocks made for bargain below its original cost which results in the
decrease of the company's net income of the said store. The management
should adopt the FIFO method and POS to have control of the inventory and
avoid obsolescence stocks and conduct training and seminars to educate the
employees of the store.

","Case Overview

Angging Dry Goods Store offered their product for cash and credit
basis. Credit was offered to selected customers like teachers, government
employees, and farmers. They offer credit up to Php20,000.00 without
collateral. The store manager also stated that they have a mark-up price of
20% in every product they sell. She added that there are times when the price
of the new stocks differs from the old stocks. In cases like this, the price of the
old stocks cannot be adjusted to the new prices since they already practiced

that kind of pricing.

She added that they let the customer chose what they wanted. As the
customer enters the store, they already knew what they need, so the sales
lady only assists the customer if they have queries about the sizes or the
prices of the product. And if the customer cannot find particular products, they
are looking for that would be the time that the sales ladies would promote their
new products available to their customers by offering it to them.

According to the store manager, there are times that they do not
consider the quality of the product. For them, if the product has a lower price,
it means that it has low quality and if the product was expensive, they think
that it has high quality. Most of the times, they based the quality of the
products on the price. In terms of promoting their products to the customers,
aside from bargaining their products, they also promote the store and its
products through radio advertisements during Christmas season. Also, when
it comes to Christmas seasons, the store gives a customized Calendar to its
customers.

The store used the Last In, First Out (LIFO) method in which the last
items that arrive would be the first one to be sold. As the new stocks arrived,
the new products were placed on top of the shelves together with the old
ones. The stock on top was the first one to be chosen as it was visible and
accessible to pick. Based on the store manager, it was also another reason
why they have an increasing number of old products because those untrendy
products were still stored inside the store and acquire defects from being

stored for months.

According to the store manager, they conducted an annual physical
count to determine the total cost of the ending inventory for BIR purposes
only. The results of the physical count are disregarded. However, the store
manager added that in physical counting of stocks, the product name and
quantity was only written in their inventory list. She also said that they
monitored their inventory every week when it was the scheduled day to place
an order to their suppliers. They purchased their fast-moving stocks weekly

and slow-moving stocks monthly. Weekly suppliers were from Butuan,
Cagayan, and Ozamiz while monthly suppliers were from Cebu and Bohol.

The store manager stated that she was the in-charge in forecasting the
inventory for the store. She decided the quantity of stocks she would order
that she thinks can minimized the costs of inventory. Besides, the manager
stated that her basis for forecasting was the number of customers looking for
a certain product at a certain time. She always considers customer's wants,
needs, and preferences. The store manager also stated that she sometimes
used her intuition to forecast the demand.

Another way for her to forecast how much they need to order was by
counting their stocks left in the shelves to determine the number of quantities
they needed to order again. She added that they do not like to have a stock-
out, so they always replenished their stocks even if they still have a lot of
stock left. According to the store manager, in terms of seasonal items, their
basis for forecasting the demand was based on their experience from the
previous years. Also, they ordered additional fifty (50) to one hundred (100)
percent of their usual order they do during peak seasons.

In ordering products from the suppliers, the store manager stated that
they counted their inventory but rarely follows the counting. She indicated that
they monitored their inventory to check what products they would order and
after checking, she listed down all the products that needed to be restocked.
She would call or send a message to various suppliers that they need to order
an item. The manager added that every week, it was a routine for them to

order fast-moving and slow-moving stocks from their suppliers even if they still
have a lot of stocks, but the delivery for slow-moving stocks was monthly.

According to the store manager, they have an agreement with the
suppliers to purchase products from them. They also have an agreement that
the store can avail purchase discounts from its suppliers if they paid in cash or
can pay before the maturity date. Aside from discounts, there would be
freebies if the store would order in bulk. The regular supplier had its weekly or
monthly schedule to deliver the products ordered by the manager.

The manager added that if there are new and trendy products that was
offered to her by several suppliers, she would order a few of it for sample if it
was salable. If she found the said products salable and trendy based on the
opinions of her employees, she immediately orders it in bulk. They also
accept bulk orders from its customers in which they immediately send a
message to the supplier that they need that certain product.

Upon receiving of the products ordered from their suppliers, they check
and count the stocks if the number of stocks corresponds the indicated
quantity in the order sheet of the supplier. The store manager stated that one
of the sales ladies is in-charge in checking and counting the new stocks to
make sure that the products that has been purchased was in good condition.
The store manager keeps the order sheet. After all the counting and checking,
the stocks was then arranged to its designated shelves.

According to the store manager, there are times when there are
defective items found from the current delivery; they would inform first the

supplier before returning the item. If there was a defective item from the
previous delivery, they returned it back to the supplier. She also added that
there are times when the suppliers did not replace the defective items for
months. In this case, she would total the amount of the defective items and
told the supplier to either deduct the amount to its new accounts or give them
a refund for the items. Some of the defective items that cannot be returned
are placed back on the shelves.

Based on the store manager, she controlled the maximum and
minimum level of inventory. She sets different levels for different products.
The fast-moving products such as textile and fabrics, ready-made uniforms
and rattan products were prioritized while the slow-moving products like
shoes, sandals, RTW’s, undergarments, bags, plastic wares, kitchen wares
and decors like curtains were left behind. If a product reached its minimum
level or fifty percent (50%) of the total quantity of the stock, she immediately
orders additional stocks.

The store manager stated that when there were new products that
arrived, the remaining old products were covered by the new products and the
old products available in the shelves were no longer visible as it was placed
under the new items. They categorized each product by section for them and
the customer to locate easily.

Dry goods like shoes, sandals, umbrellas, undergarments and some
aluminum kitchen wares that had rust, dents, peel and old items that are
stored for more than one (1) year are already qualified to be sold in a bargain.

that easily get defected as it starts peeling when it is stocked for two (2) to
three (3) years. There are stocks in the store which are not included to the
annual ending inventory because it was from the stocks that are stored for five
(5) years beyond and are already considered as obsolete items. These stocks
are still found inside the store in hopes to be sold.

The defective and old stock are offered into a markdown or bargain
price below its original cost. There are times that they conduct markdowns or
bargaining at cost, but most of the time they offer it below its original cost.
They started bargaining items ten (10) years ago and offer bargained items to
their customers every month to cope up with the costs incurred for the old
stocks. In bargaining the items, they sell it below its Original cost. Some of the
slow-moving items are paired with the fast-moving items. The manager stated
that it is the best way to reduce their inventory and so that it would be sold
easily. Every year, the quantity of old stocks increases. Some of the old
Stocks, specifically shoes, sandals and kitchen wares were purchased from
the previous years and remained displayed.

Table 1 showed the credit sales, cash sales and bargain sales of the
Store. Credit sales is thirty percent (30%) of the total annual sales while
seventy percent (70%) of it is generated from cash. The bargain sales for the
year 2015, 2016 and 2017 were twenty percent (20%), twenty-seven percent

the items were sold below its cost, the store will have a loss compared to
selling the items at original price. According to the store manager, they
consider this kind of sales than having no sales since these items cannot be

According to the Customer service information representative, the

s

common complaints that are being reported thrice a week are delay of loading
stocks to the cargoes, customers that purchases one or two cases spent in
too long of waiting to the baggage area for them to get their stocks due to the
employees who are assigned in the loading area do not exert enough effort in
helping the customer load their stocks.

Happy Enterprises and Resources Incorporated has several customers
that are no longer purchasing from the company such as Tristar Store, Elvera
Store, Alampayan Store, Oraiz/Ronwood Store, Garma Store, Mila Store,
Vross Meatshop, Breza Store, Jerry Uy Store and ZWMPC Store according to
the wholesale incharge. The wholesale incharge also stated that there are
customers that are not regular purchasers compared to previous years and
one example is Berdy Store among others.

On the other hand, the process in the wholesale, starts in the booking
area where the customers get the priority number and present it to the
encoder. Then the customers give the payment to the cashier their order to
the cashier. The cashier prints the receipts and the original copy is given to
the customers and advices them to wait for their stocks in the baggage area.

The stocks ordered by the customers are printed automatically in the
backload area in which only one backload encoders assigned to cater
thereceipts being printed. This area also is where the forklift driver and the
wheeler man stay. The backload incharge will then call the wholesale encoder
to get the priority number of the customer so that it will be listed or noted in

the paper. After getting the priority number, the backload incharge get the

and the priority number before putting it to the box of the checker. The
checker gives the receipts to the wheeler man and forklift driver to get the
Stocks to the respective warehouses.

There are 7 warehouses where the stocks are located. After getting the
Stocks, the checker makes a final check on the stocks before delivering it to
the baggage area where the customers are wait. Customers get their stocks
in a minimum time of 12 minutes if its a 1 case purchase, but if their stocks is
more than one case and is taken from different warehouses, the customers
extend their time of waiting before it is delivered to the baggage area.

The wheeler man and forklift driver served the stock of the customer
according to their priority number. If the stocks are located in different
warehouses, they will have to wait for more than 15 minutes especially if it is
located on different warehouses because the forklift driver and wheeler man
needs to transfer from one warehouse to another.

According to the checker who checks the stocks being released to the
customer and the baggage incharge, the forklift driver and wheeler man
delivers the stock to the customer but priority is given to those customers who
give tips such as money receive from customers in exchange of service. The
wholesale supervisor already warned these employees, that they are
subjected to disciplinary action should it happen. The employees performed
their duties if the supervisor is in the area supervising them. But if there are no
supervising personnel they continue to prioritized those customer who can

give them tips.

","Case Overview

Philpost Butuan provides direct to transporting services like delivering
of parcels, letters, documents and packages. Before, the year between
1980's and 1990’s company’s used the means vehicle like the bicycle on
transporting the mails to the customers. Complaints like delayed delivering of
mails were the problem of the customers who avail the Philpost Butuan
services, where the company had to deliver and accommodate the 86
barangays of the Agusan Del Norte province. And within a month, the
company delivers only the mails with its maximum of 2000 parcels and letters
at its lowest price on delivery as it was only the trusted company of every
Filipinos on transporting their products to their loved one and even business
matters. At the same time, customers expected that they would only wait only
1 to 2 days on receiving their mails and packages, but the company delivers it
for almost one month where some were found that they already change their
residency. Conflict sometimes occurred between letter couriers and
customers happened and felt disappointed by the failure services of Philpost
Butuan. On the other hand, parcels and packages also as part of the
services have received the common complaints from customers that the

goods were being fraud by some of the employees in-charge on parcels
departments. Complaints such as their products were exchanged from
authentic product into the fake one where before parcels department
employees only witness what was on the inside of the every packages of the
customers. Bad practice of employees was definitely results on losing
customers loyalty to avail their services.

By the year of 2000 onwards as the world of innovation slowly began
with the used of high technological way to communicate, the company cited
that customers were turning their trust and loyalty as the years goes by that
the advent of new technology particularly with the rise of the internet and
email, letter sending has become outdated because of the free and the real
time communication using email and different messenger services which are
even made accessible using smart phones where the customers prefer to
choose using it rather than availing postal services of Philpost Butuan. The
rise also of mumerous courier services added the dilemma of private
companies that makes it hard for the Philpost Butuan to entice people to avail
their services.

By the year 2013, as they make a realization on how they lose
customers loyalty, Philpost Butuan innovates their way on delivering services.
To fasten on transporting the mails to its customers, the company acquired
new vehicle which was the mini van that compliments its fleet, where they
were determined to deliver products from various clients to their customer

doorstep at the most cost efficient, reliable and secured way possible. To
avoid fraud, the company also installed CCTV Cameras to the parcels
department that witnesses how the employees value customer's loyalty. But
as the company was transforming their fastest way to deliver the services to
the customers, the hindrance is that when the facility/equipments like the
unavoidable damage or malfunction of the new acquired one vehicle-van the
Process of delivering either mails/parcels will not continue to distributing the
services.

For the company’s operations, Philpost Butuan extending their work
up until every Saturdays on accepting and delivering mails and parcels to
accommodate the mailing needs of postal patrons and to ensure mails and
parcels will be deliver. The Saturday schedule is a regular eight-hour work
day delivery, sending mails and also sending packages only for the couriers
of the company.

One way also a company provided was the add-on services to the
customers like Electronic Postal Money Order, where they modernize include
interfacing technology with their processes and accepts postal payment
services such as bill payments and payouts for government social projects.
From the chart shown below on Figure 2 (Philpost Butuan Annual Income
2011-2014), year 2012 shows how they decrease on their sales followed by
the year 2013 as they start on adding on their services and developing their

way of delivering services they were increasing their sales which fluctuates on
the annual income in the year 2014, which in fact 2013 was the basis that

they slowly winning back customers loyalty.

service got the highest weighted mean which can understand that it met the
customer expectations in delivering the service while the Marketing Strategies

of the four areas are being disagreed by the customers because it does not

meet the customers' expectation.

The study revealed that the marketing strategies of the company are less
acceptable for it does not meet the expectations of their customers, So there is

a need to improve especially in its product, price, place and promotion

strategies.

Mac Lending should focus on improving their marketing strategies in the

four areas in terms of Product. The company should offer their product to the
government employees and adjust their payment cycle to make it suitable for

them. In terms of place, the company should add more CCTV and one security

guard to make the customer feel safer. The customers also added that they

need to put a bigger signage outside the building so, it will easy to locate for the
new customers. In terms of Price, the company should decrease their interest
to help their customers. They should also consider their clients if they cannot
pay on time. In terms of Promotion, the business should return the giving of
money as referral incentives because it can help them. The Mac Lending should
also give leaflets to inform people that they exist. The company must update

their Facebook page to reach more new market.
","Case Overview

MAC Lending (Micro Access to Lending) was having steady growth
from 2007 to 2012. It had backslid its sales by Php 330,000 (30%) for the past
two years covering the period of 2013-2014. From 2007-2012, they used
different marketing strategies. During their first year 2007, they gave leaflets
for six months to different areas in Butuan City especially outside the mall,
they also had radio advertisement aired from September 2007 up to January
2008 as part of their promotional strategies. They also gave 10% rebates to
their first 100 clients who fully paid their account before the due date. The
company get 1% of the amount lend as processing fee and set 3% as monthly
interest. The customer can borrow Php5, 000 in the first cycle to be paid every
week in three months and up to Php100, 000 in the fifth cycle to be paid every
week in 18 months. They offered coffee and juice to the clients while waiting

for their turn. Provided snacks to those who had to wait for a long time. They
fully air-conditioned the office and put a 32 inches Television to make their

customers comfortable.

In the year 2009, the company increased their processing fee to 2%
and 3.5% monthly interest. They used referral as their primary promotional
strategy. They gave Php 500 as incentives to their debtor that can bring
another person to avail their services. In the year 2010, the company had a
radio advertisement aired from May 2010 to May 2011. They also give
Christmas gifts such as electric fan, flat iron, 5 kilos of rice, one tray of egg
and Noche Buena package to their first 50 debtors that will pay before the due
date. A raffle draw did this. From Php 100,000, the company increases the
amount that can be lend in the fifth cycle to Php 150,000 to be paid twice a
month within 28 months with 3.5% monthly interest. In 2011, the management
decided to lessen the promotional activities. They stopped the radio
advertisement. In 2012, they got the TV in the office because most of the
employees' work become unhurried. The management said that the TV was
suppose for the convenience of the customer but unfortunately, it was enjoyed
by the employees and affected their performance negatively. They also
stopped giving Php 500 to their debtors when they will refer the company to
their friends and relatives because it is too costly. The monthly interest is
already base on the cycle, from 3%-8%. The company added 6th cycle which
the customer can lend up to Php 250,000 to be paid twice a month within 36

months with 3% processing fee and 8% monthly interest.

In the year, 2013-2014 Mac lending still used referral method to

promote lending business from both customers and account officers with
incentives. Mac lending gives 1% discount as referral incentives to their
customer that can refer two persons to avail the services. The staffs give
leaflets to their customers inside the office. They also put a small signage in
their building and make a Facebook page to promote the company through
social media. They also give rewards such as grocery worth 500 to the
customers who are in their 3rd cycle. When the customers were not able to
pay on or before the due date, Mac Lending apply the 1% additional interest

as a penalty for that month.

Before MAC Lending approved the application for the loan, they will
assess first if the customer has the 5C's which represents the collateral, credit
history, capital, condition and capacity to pay. The customer needs to pledge
something they own that is worth 80% of the money they want to loan. The
company will track the record of the customer in managing credit and making
payments overtime by conducting a credit investigation. Mac Lending will ask
the customer if they have savings, investments, and other assets that can
help repay the loan. The company wants to know how the customer plan to
use the money and will consider the loan's purpose, such as whether the loan
will be used to purchase a vehicle or other property. MAC Lending need to

determine whether the customer can comfortably manage payments.

their sales for over 50%. The manager observed since 2014 that they had few
numbers of customers who dined in and take out orders. As an estimate of
the management, approximately over 50% number of customers has dropped,

the restaurant was fully air-conditioned, but now they converted it into ordinary
fans. The management stated that most of the employees would not stay

longer in the restaurant even though they have free foods and lodging.

Also, when there were increases in the cost of ingredients, the

management decided to raise the prices of the menus.

On the other hand, the management had an idea that if the problem
continued to exist, it would be a threat to the operation of the business to be

closed.

Presenting below is the approximated figures of sales provided by the
manager from 2013 to 2015. As observed, since 2014 sales started to drop

until August 2015.

them are wearing sandos, sleepers and all employees do not wear hairnet to
cover the strands of hair from falling to the baked goods. The store has only
one (1) cashier who cannot attend to all the customers immediately as it takes
a longer time to finish every purchase transactions. According to the General
Manager, due to the limited space of the store, they cannot add more tables

and chairs to the area.

used church furniture in cleaning the facility, for instance, there were mono
blocks used as ladder to clean the areas that are far to reach in the CR's even
if they already have their own tools and equipment. Another thing, the District

President was the one who put the mono block to their proper places. The
cleanliness of the surroundings was executed in a poor cleaning performance
standard because there were still areas that were not well-cleaned and
organized. It was observed that the rags that were used to clean the building
were placed in the rooms without cleaning it. The windows were not even
closed hence rain waters came in the buildings. In terms of time frame, there
are circumstances that the schedule for repair and maintenance were not
followed. Instead, the project started within the week which was stated in the

poor work quality performance and its consequences if they were not being
able to improve. Local leaders rated their cleaning quality as poor. The client's
office is hereby giving a chance to fully comply with the cleanliness standard

"CASH MANAGEMENT OF GDC EBOX TRAVEL AGENCY
BUTUAN CITY
","CASE ABSTRACT

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cash management of GDC
eBOX Travel Agency. The scope of this study is within the vicinity of GDC
eBOX Travel Agency. There were only (2) respondents; the owner and
manager who were the knowledgeable persons of the operation of the
agency. This study includes areas in cash management namely; budgeting,
cash handling, replenishment and credit granting/monitoring. The method
used in the study is descriptive research where data were gathered through
Oral interview and survey questionnaire. It indicates that the result of the over-
all rating is disagree, which means that the agency implemented and followed
the cash management practices occasionally, thereby resulting to fairly
managed cash.

From the foregoing findings, it was found out that the areas in
budgeting and cash handling got the lowest weighted mean with a verbal
description of disagree. It is recommended that in its budgeting, the agency
should handle its revenue or cash at bank properly by making it useful for the
agency’s growth and_ sustainability. While in its cash handling, it is
recommended that when the load reaches its minimum level, reorder should
be readily applied to avoid further delays whenever the middleman has
system problems. If possible, it is also recommended to increase the desired

minimum load level to make the operation of the agency stable.
","Case Overview

GDC eBox Travel Agency is a sub-agent and has partnered with a
middleman that facilitates the operation of the agency and airline. The
middleman does this through a system (ticketing system). The system works
when the agency deposits the payments to the middleman and convert it into
load. The load decreases for every booking transaction. The period that the
load will usually update takes two to three days. When the load reaches
15,000, the manager will call the owner so he will replenish it again.

This minimum load to keep before replenishing is set by the manager
and not by the middleman. The maximum amount that the manager should
replenish is 50,000 which they can sell for three to five days. The agency and
the middleman have no written agreement, but the middleman requires
20,000 as the least minimum amount to be replenished. It allows credit to
government employees, regular customers and people who are close or
known to the owner. In a month, the owner replenishes it 4 to 6 times. The
reason of delay replenishment is when the owner is busy and when there are
no funds because sometimes credit is high. The frequency of out of funds is at

the maximum of 3 times per month.

Case Overview

As of 2013, ANTRECCO Libertad consists of one hundred sixty-seven
(167) regular and four hundred forty-one (441) associate members, a total of
six hundred eight (608) members. In the year 2014, there was an increase of
eighty (80) regular and eighteen (18) associate but at the same time twelve
(12) of the members were terminated or withdrawn their membership.
Following that year 2015, there is an increase of eighty (80) regular members
and twenty-seven (27) associate where seven (7) of them were terminated

and a total of eight hundred six (806) members.

an amount of fifteen thousand (15,000) to one hundred thousand pesos
(100,000) in which the member has the capacity to pay their obligation based
on their income and their financial condition. These requirements are one of

the basis for the loan approval. Also, if the members have an ATM, they may

use it aS a means of payments. In another amount, from one hundred
thousand pesos (100,000) and above, it requires collateral in which the
borrower should pledge personal or real property assets such as a car, land

on other form of assets that was had a three (3) years or more span of life in

Figure 5. Amount Granted vs. Delinquent Amount of Associate members

Even though the delinquent accounts of the associate members
decrease, the delinquent amount is still higher. It’s because the regular
members has a higher amount granted and not all the regular members have
paid their loans. This becomes a major challenge in ANTRECCO Libertad
when members failed to pay their borrowed money as they find it difficult to
cope with their obligations to pay. ANTRECCO Libertad tried to reach out and
give possible remedies for members delayed and delinquent accounts. The
initiative taken by cooperative in order for the borrowing members to be given
considerations in the settlement is by reminding the members early, twice a
week before the due date through contacts and sometimes when they do field

Collection they inform the members when that the deadline is coming up.

Table 2 shows the annual credit sales in 2013-2015 with its total
collected payments, accounts receivable and allowance for bad debts. It
indicates that every year the accounts receivable are higher than the credit
sales collection. These will affect the company’s profitability because of the

slow capital recovery or impediment of cash flow that some even lead to bad
debt.

In the year 2013, the credit sale is P948, 168.00 in which P400, 140.00
or (48%) was collected, and the remaining accounts receivable is P548,
028.00 or (58%) which carried over to the next year’s accounts receivable.
This shows that the company is having hard time in collecting payments
because their return on credit has not reached one-hundred percent (100%)

of the annual credit sales, it was very alarming to the company because of

slow turnover in collecting receivables.

In the year 2014, Datalan restrained three (3) of customers from
Private organization with an outstanding balance and discontinued the

Services that caused the credit sales to decrease over fifteen percent (15%).
P362, 010.00 or (44%) out of P822, 568 or (100%) of the company’s annual
credit sales has been collected, and P460, 558 or (56%) is the remaining
accounts receivable. The company does not allow them to repurchase on
account temporarily and said to settle their accounts immediately. During this
year, Datalan litigated one of the debtors because he was not able to meet
the agreement after one (1) year of giving extension of payment. Credit
reminders and extensions of payment period were being made but still the

debtor did not pay his debt.

In the year 2015, the credit sales has increased over twenty-seven
percent (27%) from the previous year because of the increase demand of
computers and other computer related products in preparation for K-12
program of the private and public institutions. There was an increase of
number of customers at the same time its accounts receivable. The
company’s credit customers have increased over thirteen percent (13%) from
the year 2014, three percent (3%) of this increase came from the private
organization and ten percent (10%) came from the public organizations. Forty-
six percent (46%) of the thirteen percent (13%) increase are the new
customers, thirty-one percent (31%) are the regular/old customers and the
twenty-three percent (23%) came from the old customers who have been
restrained to purchase on account in year 2014 but have paid their full
balance at the end of the year. During this period, P460, 147.00 or (44%) was

collected over its P1, 046,865 or 100% annual total credit sales.

Figure 2. Percentage of Customer Classification to Annual Credit Sales, 2013 - 2015

Figure 2 shows the percentage contribution of private and public
organizations to the company’s annual credit sales from 2013 - 2015. The
graph indicates that private and public organizations are almost the same
when it comes to the credit sales of the company, and both organizations

affect the variance trend of credit sales from the year 2013 to 2015.

In the year 2013, the percentage contribution of private organizations is
fifty-two percent (52%) and forty-eight percent (48%) from public
organizations to company’s annual credit sales. In 2014, the percentage
contribution of private organizations is forty-nine percent (49%) and fifty-one
percent (51%) from public organizations to company’s annual credit sales,

and in 2015, forty-seven percent (47%) and fifty-three percent (53%) from

private and public organizations respectively.

In extending credit sales, the company has its current practices in
granting credit. The regular customers have a verbal agreement with the
manager with regards to the credit terms. The public and private organizations

have documents presented in granting credit such as purchase order and
promissory note. The customers from private and public organizations are

given thirty (30) days to pay its debt as term for credit.

The company’s current collection management practices in reminding
the accounts of the customers are: sending polite letter of reminder that
payment is overdue two (2) weeks before due date, telephone calls will be
made a week after the due date if payment is not yet settled. If the debtor will
not settle their accounts immediately after all the reminders are made, the
owner will request one of his staff to personally visit the debtor in his/her

convenience.

In collecting payments from private and public organizations, Datalan
grant rewards for punctual or on time payment as to offers an immediate
access to renewals of credit, an increase credit limit and offers two percent

(2%) discount to debtors who will pay a week or so before due date.

When customers cannot pay within the credit period for valid reasons,
Datalan gives debtors 1-30 days grace period to pay the full price and 180
days for the settlement of debt. The company considers the income status or
the stability of the company in extending the grace period more than 180 days

and grants “payable when able” to close friends.

Datalan charged penalties for late payments, a five percent (5%)
interest is applied when debt is not yet settled after the full payment period or
in 1-30 days grace period, and an interest of twelve percent (12%) will be

charged after 180 days grace period if account is still not settled. Datalan
does not allow debtors to repurchase on account unless they settle their all

unpaid obligations or a cancellation of credit lines.

After all the collection management practices were made and still the
payments are not collected. The last resort will then be the enforce litigation of
the customers who still have outstanding balances. Parties expressly submit
to the jurisdiction of the courts of Butuan City on any legal action arising out of
this transaction and additional sum equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the

amount due will be charge to attorney’s fees for legal action.

Table 3 shows the aging of accounts receivable of the company. This

illustrates the division of accounts receivable into different time brackets and
ranks the accounts according to their age. It is used to determine how much
of the accounts receivables are overdue for payment. It indicates that the
company is experiencing slow turnover in collecting receivables that leads to
a large percentage of overdue accounts. These accounts have higher
possibility of not being collected in full because the allowance for bad debts
that the company established is only five percent 5% annually, but in the table

shows greater percentage of overdue accounts that aged over 300 days.
In 2013, fifteen percent (15%) of the P548, 028.00 accounts receivable
are in the current period. It indicates that fifteen percent (15%) of the accounts
receivable are not yet due and is still inside the 30 days credit period.
Eighteen percent (18%) of the accounts receivables have aged 1-60 days,
twenty percent (20%) in 181-240 days, thirteen percent (13%) in 241-300
days and eighteen percent (18%) have reach over 300 days which means that
these accounts have passed the 30 days credit period given by the company
and considered as overdue accounts. It indicates that these accounts will

have longer days before the payments have been collected.

In the year 2014, seventeen percent (17%) of the P460, 558.00
accounts receivable have not yet hit the 30 days credit period, it means that
those accounts are still in the current period and has not yet due. Eleven

percent (20%) have aged 61-120 days, fifteen percent(15%) have aged 121-
180 days, twenty-one percent (21%) have aged 181-300 days, and sixteen

"INVENTORY PROCESS
OF

ANG YEE ENTERPRISE
","This study aims to evaluate the inventory process of ANG
YEE Enterprise which is a small-scale hardware located in
Barangay San Vicente, Butuan City. The proponents of this case
study have determined the inventory flow from the preparation of
purchase order to a payment of said items. However, the research
is specifically geared towards identifying areas of concern which is
the storing, arranging and labeling process of the aforementioned
hardware and eventually provides proposals and recommendations
that will be feasible and reasonable to the current predicament of

the company.

The researchers used descriptive research method since it
involves the gathering of data that describes events and situations
which then organized into useful and relevant information. The
respondents, which represent the total population, comprising of the
owner and his employees were subjected to interviews and survey.
The researchers also conducted actual field observation during the

duration of this study.

Results of the survey showed that its inventory process was
occasionally practiced with an overall mean of 2.44 which is
verbally described as SOMETIMES. Under the category of

STORING, the overall mean is 3.21 which means OFTEN
practiced, 2.70 or OFTEN practiced under ARRANGEMENT and
1.42 or NEVER practiced under LABELING. Based on the results, it
can be concluded that the enterprise lacks the proper methods and
practices in the process of storing, arranging and labeling its
inventory. This is due to the fact that the business does not
regularly check its inventory for any sign of defect and deterioration.
With regard to the arrangement, items are not grouped according to
function typically found in a hardware store. On labeling, the

business does not have any form or system of labeling.

Several adjustments and changes could improve the current
inventory process of the enterprise. About the STORING, inventory
should be checked weekly for any sign of damage and
deterioration. Items should be arranged, organized and grouped
according to the most basic grouping of items in a hardware store in
order to avoid items getting mixed-up up with other items. Products
and all forms of storage materials should be labeled accordingly
with the appropriate names and pictures. By having a systematic
way of storing, arranging and labeling of inventory, products will be

easier to find and reduce time in locating inventory.
","Case Overview

The enterprise’s location used to form part of the proprietors residence
before it was converted to a hardware store. The store has a receiving area for
customers and a display area for its merchandise. Adjacent to its display area is
the storage room where most of its goods are temporarily stored.

The owner usually purchases goods on a weekly basis from selected
large-scale wholesaler hardware stores in the city. He also has suppliers who

provide him with goods directly from the manufacturing company. Whenever a
wr _

Z
customer demands goods that are not available, theowner requests stocks from

his main suppliers in the city.

Upon receipt of goods purchased, the owner or one of his employees
checks to verify that it is complete and defect-free. The purchase order for the
goods is then kept, but the business has no specific logbook or ledger card where
the inventory should be recorded. The goods are then stored in the storage room
or display area or handed to customers who requested for such goods. The
items/goods have no labels and some get mixed-up with other products. Items in

the storage room have no labels as well or even bin/tag cards.

All the five employees do not have a specific function that sometimes
leads to overlapping and confusion of duties except for one employee who is

being entrusted as cashier whenever the owner is not around.

The enterprise conducts random physical inventory only to check the stock
level for them to determine if new purchases should be made but there is no
specific minimum stock level or re-order point. The business also does not adopt

a method for the outflow of goods since its products are not perishable.
4
The owner prepares the purchase order (PO) or his assistant whenever he

is not around. The original copy of the PO is given to the supplier, and the
duplicate is safe kept in the store/hardware. The goods purchased are then
delivered to the store or picked up by the owner himself. Upon delivery, the
goods are checked based on the duplicated copy of the PO and inspected for any
defects. Goods that passed the quality check are then kept and stored in the
storage room or stored right away in the display area while the defective ones are

returned to the supplier. Payment is then processed and given to suppliers for the

goods delivered in good condition.

that the finance in-charge should provide an expansion or more than the
minimum amount of cash required to allow for some margin of error in
planning. Every transaction should be approved by the general manager with
supporting documents. The company should strictly implement their collection
Process and minimize the collection period and follow the 15 days grace

their liabilities, they could only pay for their interest.

The company’s payment process is consignment which is payable
within 60 to 120 days. In which, according to the owner, it is one of the causes
why the company keeps acquiring loans, to sustain their production.

According to the manager, 78% is not enough for them to sustain the

needs of the MCCB and they are afraid that they would not meet the limit
standard of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas of which the past due ratio must not
exceed to 15%. The MCCB's releases of Commercial Loans totalled Php
82,190,064.53 and they only collected Php 63,858,747.14 having the amount

required to help each other by accompanying the assigned account officer to
visit the borrowers place with all delinquent accounts to force the borrower to
pay for them to maximize their collections but mostly the borrower refused to
pay. The account officer also addresses that some of them say that they do not

have available cash.

place just to force them to pay their delinquent accounts but still having a
variance of 18%.

In the year 2014, they only collected 78% of the 95% target collection.
Using all the account officers in collecting delinquent accounts again was still

their number one solution but still having a variance of 17%. Some of the
borrowers declared bankruptcy of their business and others say their having
weak earnings or having slack sales.

email. The Account Officer also added that the cooperative bank does sending
text messages and calls to borrowers after the due date because there were

assigned person to do the duty. Sometimes the account officer could not make

the follow-ups to the borrowers because of not enough time.

attorney's letter which served as a warning for litigation. According to the
account officer, the bank that will demand the borrowers that if they will not pay

the delinquent accounts they will raise it to the court which they will pay all the

expenses that will be incurred of the case.

When the account is delinquent for 25 days, If the borrower personally

asks for the bank’s consideration to undergo the payments, the first option is to
have the staggered payments or the borrower will plan his/her own plan of
payment for his/her convenience. Also, the BOD gives amnesty if they really
see the borrower cannot afford to pay the bills because of such unpredictable
problems or emergency that they have experienced. According to the account
officer the cooperative bank gives the amnesty to those exceptional people
worthy to be given the amnesty or they do not have a capacity to pay.

agreement will be made between the credit union and the borrower. The legal
action will be applied to recover the delinquent accounts of the borrower and
shall commence in any account when no acceptable installment agreement
has been made. According to the bookkeeper the cooperative bank
recommends the formal workout agreement stated in their policy to the
borrower who have been delinquent their accounts.

between the bank and the borrower, the pursuance of the case or the litigation
will be imposed. It will be attended by the Manager, Account Officer, the
borrower and the co-maker. There will be schedule of hearings until the court
will reach a decision for the case but as much as possible the company sets
arrangements like asking for the borrower's own payment plan signed by the
borrower or giving him/her an amnesty so that the bank will not be able to raise
any serious fegal cases against them. The cooperative bank practiced the

litigation to their borrowers as the 1* priority for the litigation will be the
18
borrowers who have the capacity to pay through their assets. The Account

Officer said that almost of the borrowers with delinquent accounts borrowed
only below Php 100,000.00 which is not qualified in raising the case in the
court. They only pursue the case if the borrower was proven that he/she have
the capacity to pay or do have assets to use as the payments for the borrowed

amount.

"MANPOWER UTILIZATION OF WAT EVER FAMILY KTV BAR
","CASE ABSTRACT

Manpower utilization is a business concept that describes effectively
how a business uses its manpower or employees. Businesses commonly use
the concept of manpower utilization to evaluate output in relation to labor
costs. Businesses use this concept to find new ways to more effectively
hamess the output of labor. Thus, it is the duty of the manager to find the right
person to do the right work and to allocate work according to the capabilities
of an employee. Then only manpower can be utilized effectively.
Effectiveness in manpower utilization helps the employees to find the

opportunities and to perform accordingly.

The study aimed to evaluate and assess the manpower utilization of
Wat Ever Family KTV Bar, in terms of job description, work scheduling,
supervision and workload, which affect the productivity of the employees who
are directly working in the operations. The primary data will come from the
respondents which are the employees of Wat Ever family KTV Bar; which
consist of cashiers, waiters, barmen, kitchen crews and utilities and it will be
through interviews and survey questionnaire. The secondary data will be from
books, journal article and websites based from the researchers readings,

previous studies, published and unpublished thesis relevant to the study.

The study used the descriptive research method; the researchers
utilized the whole population of Wat Ever Family KTV Bar who are directly
working in the operations. The frequency distribution was used in organizing

the data while frequency distribution table using weighted mean was used
presenting the results of the ratings. The tool used to analyze the weighted
mean of the job description, work scheduling, supervision and workload was

The researchers carefully analyzed the results of the study so that in
one way or another it could some help the management of Wat Ever Family

description, work Scheduling, supervision and workload that affect the

productivity of the employees.

all and the manpower utilization is ineffective. With these results it can be
concluded that Wat Ever Family KTV Bars employees in terms of job

The researchers proposed the following recommendations. For the job
description ;for each employee, a good job description helps the employees to
understand their duties and responsibilities, their relative importance of their
duties and how their position contributes to the mission, goals and objectives
of the organization. Contribute to organizational effectiveness by ensuring that

the work carried out by staff is aligned with the organization's mission.

Work Scheduling

The management should consider peak hours when allocating the

number of employees per shift. The employees will appreciate working for a
business that cares about their leisure time. Take employees’ preferences into
account when scheduling. Distribute highly sought after shifts evenly among
employees as much as possible. Also ask them which days or hours they
have problems with in order to avoid ""violating"" their preferences. The chart
for the schedule should be posted so that it is easy for team members to view

and access it.
Supervision

Support employee's conditions for their motivation. Observe employees
performance and give feedback for their guidance. Tailoring work
assignments rewards and recognition to individual employee needs and
desires. The supervisor needs to consider not only what each employee is
capable of doing but also what assignments will provide challenges and

development opportunities to employees.
Workload

The store manager should generate and implement timely strategies
for dealing with peak periods of demand such as job sharing. Assign the
workload equitably. Educate their employees by providing knowledge on
topics relevant to managing workload, stress management and burnout.

Communicate with the employees regularly about how they can manage and

adjust their workload.

peak hour for the operation. Wat Ever Family KTV Bar has a total number of
16 rooms which consist of 2 big rooms that can occupy up to 40 persons, 14
small rooms that can occupy for 12-15 persons each room. Aside from that,

there are also 20 tables outside for outdoor seating for customers who just

want to drink and dine.
Wat Ever Family KTV Bar is the most popular meeting and events
venue of most people in town due to its viable location, high-quality sound
systems, and their professional audio video system, so it become a place of
choice for special celebrations or just bonding with friends, families and
colleagues. In Table 1 and 2 shows the Manpower distribution during regular
days and on weekends and the total number of crews who work for the
operations. Opening cashiers, utility, waiter, and kitchen crew punched in at
9:30 AM, which is thirty (30) minutes before the opening of the store to
prepare each of their stations for the opening. Mid-shift will be punched in at
exactly 3:00 PM and Evening Shift at 6:00 PM. Each crew has minimum of
nine hours of work less one hour for break time, but still it depend on the
availability of the teams and whether the store is in its peak hour.

In Table 1 and 2 of manpower distribution; cashiers, utility, and kitchen
crews have the same manpower distribution during regular days and
weekend. But on the part of the waiters and the barman’s there are only
seven waiters and two barman’s during the weekend and eight waiters and
one barman on regular days. Comparing Table 1 and 2 which is the
Manpower Distribution to Table 3 which is the average number of rooms
being utilized per hour, 5:00 PM is the starting time for peak hour of the
operations, this is also the time were most of the employees lose their focus
on their jobs because of multitasking and doing a different kind of task at the
same time. Cashiers job is to handle all of the cash transactions, receive
payments and check daily cash counts but instead, they need to serve food

and attend to some of the customers needs and request. Waiters are

Table 3.2. Room Utilization per hour from January to August 2015

Table 3.1 and 3.2 is the representation of the average room utilization
per hour in Wat Ever Family KTV Bar from January to August 2015. Starting
from 5:00 PM till Dawn, which is 2:00 in the morning, is the peak hour of the
operation. During morning shift to mid-shift which is 10:00 AM to 6:00 pm
there are only two waiters available, two kitchen crews, one cashier and one

utility and the average room utilization per hour is from 3 rooms to 14 rooms.

Every week there is one employee who gets suspended because of
tardiness, so eventually some staff does not have the choice but to work
beyond their working hours to fill in the job of those suspended and absent
employees. Break time is not being followed, so eating late of the employees
are also common. They cannot leave their stations especially if there is no
one around because the responsible person is late, absent or it is peak hour,

and the store manager needed them to extend their hours of duty.

Most of the employees during weekends and evening shift have the

difficulty attending or accommodating promptly, mostly the needs of the
Customers because some of the employees are late, absent or suspended.
Long commute, waking up late, family issues like taking care of the kids and
problems concerning live-in partners and jealous wife are some of the
reasons. There are instances that some of the waiters who work during
evening shift work in the morning the next day, they feel so restless, and they
do not have the motivation because of sleepiness. So, mostly of the
employees who work during evening shift are prone to error and missed some
of the urgent request of the customer due to multiple activities and lack of
focus. Simultaneous task finds the employees mixed up on whose customers

request are going first due to this sometimes the store manager scolded them

in front of the customers that make them feel embarrassed.

"THE IMPACT OF GRILLING OPERATION

OF MANG INASAL BUTUAN
","CASE ABSTRACT
The main purpose of the Study is to determine the impact of grilling
procedure to customer satisfaction on the quality of the grilled chicken product
as perceived by the customers. This study focus on the process and products
in the grill station. The Study utilized descriptive method and purposive
convenience sampling technique in research that describes the consistency of

the standard operating procedure (SOP) in grilling operation and level of

customer satisfaction.

Based on the results of the evaluation, it revealed that in griling the
chicken of Mang Inasal, standard operating procedures are practiced in few

cases, thereby, resulted to dissatisfaction among customers.

With this, it was recommended that Mang Inasal Butuan needs to
strenghthen the implementation of its policies and procedures to minimize sub
standard practices in the grilling section. They must intensify first the crew
training program. Motivate the crews for them to follow the standard
operating procedures only. Provide protection to the employees especially to
those involved in the Grilling Section such as; protective gears, proper
ventilation and allowances. It is proper for the management to regularly check
a especially in grill station so that standard

and monitor production are

operating procedures are consistently followed. They have to ensure that only

standard quality chicken products will be served to customers to avoid

complains.
","Case Overview

The grill station is where the products of Mang Inasal are being
prepared. More than a half of store sales came from products of the grill

station thus grill station is considered as the main production area.
4

One the factors that needs to take into consideration is on the Quality
and Quantity of Charcoal, good quality charcoal will burn longer than low-
quality ones. Higher heat and a minimal quantity of ash, damp charcoal may
delay the grilling process. The standard quality of charcoal that Mang Inasal
uses in grilling is made of ipil-ipi] but sometimes the charcoal they usually use
is not available Causing them to use other brand of charcoal that leads to
delay of grilling process because of its quality. The supplier admitted that they
cannot supply the ipil-ipil type of charcoal because it is limited and delivered

Sari Sari type instead.

Another factor to be considered is the Efficiency of the Exhaust
System, an efficient exhaust system will remove smoke that may bring about
a foggy grilling area. An efficient exhaust system will also ensure that the grill
person will not have a hard time in visually inspecting the products he is
grilling. But due to the small space in the kitchen area, proper ventilation

cannot accommodate the whole kitchen area and the grill crews feels

uncomfortable to work.

Lighting Fixture is also one of the factors of having standard, the grill

exhaust hood lighting fixture must be in good condition at all times. A busted

lamp will make it hard for the grill crew to inspect the products for doneness

visually but there is no problem in the lightning fixture because crews are

monitoring the condition of the lights. Managers will always replace buted

lamp immediately.
Lastly, Thawing and internal Temperature, thawing, as well as the
internal temperature upon grilling greatly affects the grilling process and
quality of the end Products. Chicken products most especially must be
properly thawed to attain perfect Inasal grilled products at standard grilling
time. It must be noted that the lower temperature, the longer it will take to
cook the inside portion. A product that took longer to grill because of its half
frozen or semi thawed state will result to charred or burned products outside
and dry meat inside (the juice inside the products dries due to the longer
grilling time). Cooking of chicken takes only 22 minutes. When the delivery of
chicken is delayed, the grill crews are thawing the chicken improperly. Instead
of thawing it in the standard time which is 18 hours in the chiller with the
temperature of 2-3 degrees celcius, chicken is quickly thawed for only 2-3
hours at room temperature that leads the chicken being semi-frozened and

results to bloody inside and burnt outside portion of the chicken.

Production Guide controls the availability and in order to produce a
good quality product in a given period of time. Every hour has a equivalent
chicken product to be prepared according to sales. Grill crews usually
prepared more than the quantity given in the production guide to be able to
have enough cooked chicken during peak hours. These inconsistencies

usually happens during peak hours everyday during 11:am — 2:00pm at

daytime and 6:00-8:00pm at night time.

"inventory Controi of Banaybanay Dry Goods Store
","CASE ABSTRACT

This research is entitled ""Inventory Control of Banaybanay Dry Good
Store”. This study was conducted in Banaybanay Dry Good Store at Taglatawan,
Bayugan City.

Banaybanay Dry Goods Store.

The scope of this study was focuses on the evaluation of the inventory
control of Banaybanay Dry Goods Store specifically physical counting on
receiving, releasing, reporting and recording of inventory which based on the
annual record of the store. There are a total of 9 respondents from the store
which are the manager and the staffs who were knowledgeable about the
inventory control of the store. Also the primary data is through research interview
with the management and employee. Secondary sources are from the customers
and the related studies.

The researchers used the descriptive method, to assess the practices
and procedures for controlling the inventory. Also, the researchers used
purposive sampling and complete enumeration; it is purposive because the
respondents were selected directly from the employee of the store, and it was
complete enumeration because all the nine (9) employee of Banaybanay Dry
Goods store was considered as respondents. The researchers used the

frequency distribution in organizing the data. Data were presented using the
central tendency measures; weighted mean; in the frequency distribution table,

the Likert Scale was used to analyze the data gathered.
The result showed that the evaluation of inventory control of Banaybanay
Dry Good Store was applied in most or majority cases which are effective as
perceived by the respondents. This was further supported by the results of the
study that among the four areas of the study; the Reporting Inventory Control
Processes had the weighted mean of 2.22, and Recording Inventory Control
Processes with the weighted mean of 2.24, which were seldom applied by the
respondents, the result means that the respondents applied in few cases which is
less effective.

As concluded, after thorough evaluation, it was found out that the
Inventory Control processes implemented by Banaybanay Dry Good Store was
quite effective, despite of the issues raised by the customers. Yet, in terms of
recording and reporting of inventories, these were the areas that require
improvements, for these might be the sources of the existing problem of the
business. Therefore the researcher recommends that management should
implement the appropriate internal controls such as; providing index card with
information about the product, listing of remained items in detailed (quality, color,
sizes, and styles) and determine the fast and slow moving items to provide the

exact items that the customers wanted and to ensure that all inventory products

are maintained.
","Case Overview

The store experiences out of stock in catering the needs of their
customers. According to the customers, there are times that they cannot
provide the desired styles, sizes and colors of certain stocks to the customers
because it is out of stock. Instead of giving the goods that were asked, they

offer substitute products. But customers tend to look for the exact item that
3
they need. Customers tend to complain about the products because it is out of

stock which leads the customers to switch to other stores, and decide not to
buy the item at all.
Since customers decided to switch to other stores, it resulted in a

decrease in sales as showed on Table 1below.

"INVENTORY PROCESS
OF
ANG YEE ENTERPRISE
","This study aims to evaluate the inventory process of ANG
YEE Enterprise which is a small-scale hardware located in
Barangay San Vicente, Butuan City. The proponents of this case
study have determined the inventory flow from the preparation of
purchase order to a payment of said items. However, the research
is specifically geared towards identifying areas of concern which is
the storing, arranging and labeling process of the aforementioned
hardware and eventually provides proposals and recommendations
that will be feasible and reasonable to the current predicament of

the company.

The researchers used descriptive research method since it
involves the gathering of data that describes events and situations
which then organized into useful and relevant information. The
respondents, which represent the total population, comprising of the
owner and his employees were subjected to interviews and survey.
The researchers also conducted actual field observation during the

duration of this study.

Results of the survey showed that its inventory process was
occasionally practiced with an overall mean of 2.44 which is
verbally described as SOMETIMES. Under the category of

STORING, the overall mean is 3.21 which means OFTEN
practiced, 2.70 or OFTEN practiced under ARRANGEMENT and
1.42 or NEVER practiced under LABELING. Based on the results, it
can be concluded that the enterprise lacks the proper methods and
practices in the process of storing, arranging and labeling its
inventory. This is due to the fact that the business does not
regularly check its inventory for any sign of defect and deterioration.
With regard to the arrangement, items are not grouped according to
function typically found in a hardware store. On labeling, the

business does not have any form or system of labeling.

Several adjustments and changes could improve the current
inventory process of the enterprise. About the STORING, inventory
should be checked weekly for any sign of damage and
deterioration. Items should be arranged, organized and grouped
according to the most basic grouping of items in a hardware store in
order to avoid items getting mixed-up up with other items. Products
and all forms of storage materials should be labeled accordingly
with the appropriate names and pictures. By having a systematic
way of storing, arranging and labeling of inventory, products will be

easier to find and reduce time in locating inventory.
","Case Overview

The enterprise’s location used to form part of the proprietors residence
before it was converted to a hardware store. The store has a receiving area for
customers and a display area for its merchandise. Adjacent to its display area is
the storage room where most of its goods are temporarily stored.

The owner usually purchases goods on a weekly basis from selected
large-scale wholesaler hardware stores in the city. He also has suppliers who

provide him with goods directly from the manufacturing company. Whenever a
2
customer demands goods that are not available, theowner requests stocks frorn

his main suppliers in the city.

Upon receipt of goods purchased, the owner or one of his employees
checks to verify that it is complete and defect-free. The purchase order for the
goods is then kept, but the business has no specific logbook or ledger card where
the inventory should be recorded. The goods are then stored in the storage room
or display area or handed to customers who requested for such goods. The
items/goods have no labels and some get mixed-up with other products. Items in

the storage room have no labels as well or even bin/tag cards.

All the five employees do not have a specific function that sometimes
leads to overlapping and confusion of duties except for one employee who is

being entrusted as cashier whenever the owner is not around.

The enterprise conducts random physical inventory only to check the stock
level for them to determine if new purchases should be made but there is no
specific minimum stock level or re-order point. The business also does not adopt

a method for the outflow of goods since its products are not perishable.
4
The owner prepares the purchase order (PO) or his assistant whenever he

is not around. The original copy of the PO is given to the supplier, and the
duplicate is safe kept in the store/hardware. The goods purchased are then
delivered to the store or picked up by the owner himself. Upon delivery, the
goods are checked based on the duplicated copy of the PO and inspected for any
defects. Goods that passed the quality check are then kept and stored in the
storage room or stored right away in the display area while the defective ones are

returned to the supplier. Payment is then processed and given to suppliers for the

goods delivered in good condition.

SEDCO's major operation is lending, in particular, the regular loan with
the primary purpose of generating funds to provide credit to the members for
the livelihood and provide housing benefits. The members of the cooperative
are categorized into two (2). Class A is the supervisory position and has a
higher capital build-up that can avail huge amount of loan. Class B is the lower
position and has an average income that can avail an enough amount of credit
based on their capital. The employees of DAR are affected by the

the cooperative. The members were transferred from DAR Office-Libertad to
their respective item and had a huge bear amount of loan.

The management is continuously calling the attention of these members
to pay their accounts. Those members cannot pay because they have existing
loans including in their new offices until their accounts were increased with the

amount of 1.6 Million. However, the management had procedures to collect the
4
delinquent amounts: (1) they sent four notices each member; (2) issue five

demand letters and (3) litigation, but no Payment received

Lately, the cooperative had issued notices to the co-maker of the

delinquent members and set a Schedule for a meeting. Because of this
experience, they will require a collateral before approving the loans from
members for security purposes.

The current asset of the cooperative is P6,312,441.08 and the total
liabilities of 193,495.25. The delinquent amount is P1,605,753.74. As of June

2015, the delinquent amount is 26% of the working capital.
",Case Study
"COLLECTION POLICY OF ANTRECCO LIBERTAD
","Agusan Del Norte teachers, retirees, employees and community, one
of the Cooperatives in Butuan City, has been experiencing an increase in
delinquent amount of loans and are facing a challenge in collecting payments
from the borrowers from the year 2013 up to 2015. The purpose of this study

is to assess the implementation of its collection policy.

The specific areas of the study are the credit reminders, payment
alternatives, monitoring and follow ups and litigation. The respondents are the
regular members and associate members, these are the members allowed for
loans. The researchers of this study used the descriptive method for the
purpose of evaluation in this case. The survey questionnaire served as a way

of collecting the data of 60 respondents.

The researchers found out that the current collection policy of
ANTRECCO Libertad is fairly implemented and followed. They concluded that

the cooperative is lenient in imposing its collection policy.

The researchers recommend that if the member has no positive
response to their obligation, the cooperative must file a lawsuit against the
debtor so that there will be a settlement in both parties on how the debt will be
paid and the debtor will take it more seriously in facing obligation knowing that

the legal action may be costly.
","Case Overview

As of 2013, ANTRECCO Libertad consists of one hundred sixty-seven
(167) regular and four hundred forty-one (441) associate members, a total of
six hundred eight (608) members. In the year 2014, there was an increase of
eighty (80) regular and eighteen (18) associate but at the same time twelve
(12) of the members were terminated or withdrawn their membership.
Following that year 2015, there is an increase of eighty (80) regular members
and twenty-seven (27) associate where seven (7) of them were terminated

and a total of eight hundred six (806) members.

Most of the regular and associate members can avail loans that have
an amount of fifteen thousand (15,000) to one hundred thousand pesos
(100,000) in which the member has the capacity to pay their obligation based
on their income and their financial condition. These requirements are one of

the basis for the loan approval. Also, if the members have an ATM, they may
fe)
use it as a means of payments. In another amount, from one hundred
thousand pesos (100,000) and above, it requires collateral in which the
borrower should pledge personal or real property assets such as a car, land
on other form of assets that was had a three (3) years or more span of life in

every depreciable asset.

The table below shows the total money disbursements for the 3 years’

transactions.

In every year transactions, there is a disbursement of money. Although

in 2014 had a decrease in overdue accounts, the amounts that are being

granted are increasing because the members who availed loans are

increasing as well. Not all of the money that was disbursed are being paid

back to the cooperative. Some of the borrowers are not consistently paying

the borrowed money. That is why in year 2015, the overdue accounts

increased. According to the branch head of ANTRECCO Libertad; the more

the money disbursements, expectedly the more delinquents will come. Also

once the money being disbursed, the risk will start.

These figures below show the segregation of the accounts and

amounts of regular and associate members that are being granted and

delinquent from 2013 up to 2015.

Figure 5. Amount Granted vs. Delinquent Amount of Associate members

Even though the delinquent accounts of the associate members
decrease, the delinquent amount is still higher. It’s because the regular
members has a higher amount granted and not all the regular members have
paid their loans. This becomes a major challenge in ANTRECCO Libertad
when members failed to pay their borrowed money as they find it difficult to
cope with their obligations to pay. ANTREGCO Libertad tried to reach out and
give possible remedies for members delayed and delinquent accounts. The
initiative taken by cooperative in order for the borrowing members to be given
considerations in the settlement is by reminding the members early, twice a
week before the due date through contacts and sometimes when they do field

collection they inform the members when that the deadline is coming up.

can attend the hearing. However, the cooperative never underment this kind

ahead of time before due dates and regular saver. Class B, are borrowers
who pay on their due dates and does not pay regularly in Savings. Class C,

are those borrowers who are delinquent payers and does not pay regularly in

Savings.

According to the loan clerk, Class A borrowers have no possibilities
10

that their accounts will become delinquent for the reason that their capacity to
pay Is proven and they are trusted by the cooperative. The borrower becomes
Class A when he/she avails three (3) consecutive loans without delayed
payments. However, Class B borrowers have possibilities that their accounts
will become delinquent for the reason that when the account officer/credit
investigator collect their monthly amortization they was not able to pay
because they need their money to buy some of their needs. Thus, they ask an
extension of their Payments. Class C borrowers are those who avail
credit/loans for the first time, since their character as a borrower are not yet
validated by the cooperative. And in most cases, Class C borrower has the
most delinquent accounts. Class A, B and C borrower are composed of
eighteen (18) thirty two (32) and fifty four (54) accounts respectively.

According to the loan clerk the borrowers of Commercial Loan are
Class C members who had small businesses. They can avail the loan as long
as they have the capacity to pay and their income is stable. These are the
reasons that the members were not able to pay his/her obligation due to
fortuitous event like failure of business operation, family emergencies,
financial problems, and the borrowers character who name the Capacity to

pay but the willingness to pay is absent.

collector is expected to visit the member's residence or business office to collect
payment. Once the collection is made, the cash will be remitted to the Cashier.

In the event that the member borrower did not pay during the due date,
the cooperative will set and monitor the given grace period for them which is
five (5) days after due date. If he/she does not pay within the grace period, the
cooperative will send the First Collection Notice day after the grace period. If
the member still did not pay, the cooperative will send the Second Collection

Notice between 20-30 days after the due date.
~~“

If the member cannot pay after the second notice, the member is
required to visit the cooperative to clarify all his/her obligations. The Account
Officer and Member will agree the payment alternative set by the Loan Officer.
Until this time, the cooperative sets payment alternatives: over the counter
payment, payment through ATM, automatic deduction from the capital savings,
and payment through collectors. The member borrowers can choose which
payment alternatives they want as to their convenience.

lf the member borrower continues neglecting the Account Officers’
reminders and follow ups, a report will be forwarded to the loan officer that a
certain account is delinquent after Account Officer’s thorough evaluation. After
which, a Third Collection Notice will be sent 45 days after the amount is due
and 14 days after the account is delinquent. The notice constitutes a notification
to the member that his record will be transferred to legal collection and will be
personally delivered to the member. Furthermore, out-of-court action will be
taken 30 days after the account has been considered delinquent. In this case,
the cooperative will send 1% and 2™ demand letter to the delinquent member
borrowers signed by the lawyer. On the third or final demand letter the lawyer
was task to send the letter to the delinquent member borrowers. This time the
lawyer sets an ultimatum to the delinquent member borrower to settle their
obligations including penalty fees. Lastly, legal collections will proceed 60 days
after the accounts have been deemed delinquent. Controls will be established
to determine the efficiency of the lawyer in-charge of legal collection. Including

court visits and reviewing of the legal files. Lawyers are expected to present a
monthly status report. All expenses of administrative, legal, and out-of-court
collection are to be paid by the delinquent member.

When the delinquent member borrower fails to pay his/her obligations
after legal collections, the lawyer and the cooperative will set an agreement to
repossess the collateral of the said delinquent member borrower. They will set
a foreclosure date to redeem the property of the borrower.

The records revealed that there were 338 accounts deemed to be
delinquent within the year 2016. These accounts reached a total loan receivable
of Php 12, 635, 174.16. An account is considered delinquent if it is one month

department start the out of court collection 61-90 days the account was due.
On the contrary, the account officers stated that out of 338 delinquent member
borrowers that are supposedly are subject for litigation, there are less than 10
member borrowers who reached in the out-of-court litigation. Moreover, the
cooperative has not pursued court litigation for the delinquent member
borrowers because they are still members that have a major role of the
cooperative. Also, the employees have a big respect to the members: whether
delinquent borrower or not.

According to the Branch Manager, the demand for the microfinance loan

increased due to the expansion and growth of business in Butuan City, and
there were two (2) Account Officers who were assigned to collect member
borrowers’ payments.

As stated by the Account Officer, in year 2015 the number of delinquent
accounts increased because the number of members who availed for
microfinance loans surged as well. Due to the increasing number of delinquent
accounts, account officers exerted more efforts, made house visitations to
remind the member borrowers’ the agreed payment scheme. They were forced
to receive payments in small amounts and possible remedies were offered.
Moreover, they gave considerations in the settlement by reminding the member
borrowers early, twice a week before the due date through phone
communication. Sometimes when the account officers do the house to house
collection they inform the member borrowers when their due date is. Most
member borrowers’ at the time of visit appeal to various reasons, like: (1)
insufficient cash available, (2) has priority to pay like water bill and electric bill,
(3) has to pay tuition fees, (4) failure of harvest, (5) no salary yet, (6) no
collectibles, (7) emergency use of fund, (8) slipped from mind, (9) no interest of

paying, (10) refused to pay remaining unpaid balance, and (11) others are

claiming that their account were already fully paid.

"CASH MANAGEMENT OF PEAK FOODS PROCESSING
","The study evaluated the implementation of cash management of Peak
Foods Processing in Dona Rosario, Tubay, Agusan Del Norte specifically on
the cash budget, cash disbursement, cash collections and cash monitoring.
The study used a descriptive research method to investigate the cash
management of Peak Foods Practices.

The study employed purposive-complete enumeration sampling where
the respondents of the study are the general manager, finance in-charge, and
bookkeeper involved in the cash management of Peak Foods Processing.
The respondents were surveyed through questionnaires and interviews.

The findings revealed that the practices of cash management that is
being implemented by the company were lenient.

The findings implied that in order to solve the cash management
problem of Peak Foods Processing, the researchers proposed that it’s better
that the finance in-charge should provide an expansion or more than the
minimum amount of cash required to allow for some margin of error in
planning. Every transaction should be approved by the general manager with
supporting documents. The company should strictly implement their collection
process and minimize the collection period and follow the 15 days grace
period of every transaction. The bookkeeper should prepare and submit a
daily cash report to the general manager. And record all the collected cash
and should be written in one account book to avoid inconsistent data and

incorrect cash balances.
","Case Overview

Peak Foods Processing is a small-medium enterprise business that
manufactures bottled sweetened kaong and nata de coco, it produces nata de
coco and kaong in various sizes, 8 ounce, 12 ounce, 24 ounce and 32 ounce,
which comes in various flavors and colors.

In the year 2013, the company had planned in improving their
production capability by acquiring new equipment. The project cost
P2,614,194.96. However, due to lack of funds the company asked for
assistance from the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) and
submitted a feasibility study wherein the department approved and released a
total amount of P208,747.00. The amount funded by the department was just
enough for the acquisition of the new equipment. The management decided to
apply for an additional loan amounting to P1,000,000 for them to be able to

continue their production.

Figure 2. Weekly Expense Ratio
The company needed an estimated amount of 1,000,000 capital for
their raw materials and other supplies for their production per week. From the
figure above, the capital of ? 1,000,000 breakdowns into, 25.31% for bottles,
8.75% for caps, 0.72% for cap seal, 1.69% for the labels, 2.7% for boxes,
29.38% for raw kaong and raw nata, 15.78% for white sugar, 4.88% for
cylinder LPG, 4.89% for labor, 0.30% for utility expense, 3.61% for the freight
expenses, and the 0.98% for the miscellaneous expense. This amount of
capital came from a portion of their profit or collection is 40% and the 60%
came from the portion of their loan or debt and investors.
The company plans their budget according to their client’s purchase
orders, for them to budget their expenses for the next production they directly

deduct 25% as their operating expense from their previous net income as
; 8
their basis. Sixty percent (60%) from their total amount of collection is being

paid to their liabilities, and the remaining amount wil) be spent for their
production. They will divide the remaining amount for their operating
expenses, amounting to P631,327.50 and administrative expenses of

32,500.00.

In a week, the company can produce 1,000 boxes of all sizes and
variances equivalent to 24,000 bottles, excluding pending purchase orders.
The total amount of their pending orders also depends on their client's product
orders. According to the owner, the company has a weekly expense
amounting to P663,827.50, these expenses were from the purchase of bottles
worth P168,000, caps worth P64,800, seal for caps worth P4,800, labels
worth £11,280, boxes worth P18,000, raw kaong and nata worth P195,000,
white sugar worth P104,797.5, cylinder LPG worth P32,400, salary/wages
worth £32,500, utility expense worth P2,000, freight expense worth P24,000
and miscellaneous expenses worth P6,250. From these productions, the
company has a net sales amounting to P1,200,000 weekly, and a net profit
amounting to 536,172.50, this amount is from their total income less their
total expense. According to the awner, from this net profit, 60% af it will be
paid for their liabilities; the remaining amount will be used for production
capital. The company needed an estimated amount of 1,000,000 for their
production, in which according to them the company need an investor and/or
file an application for loan to sustain their production.

In addition, prices are the same even if the delivery is within or
9
outside of CARAGA Region, wherein the company shoulders the freight
expenses from the manufacturing plant to the port. Their clients also, received
a 15% of trade discount, the 2% of marketing support, and 2% of prompt

payment discount; prompt payment is when the client pays directly during

ordering products.
The company purchase their raw materials every Friday and Saturday.
During the purchasing of raw materials, the bookkeeper sometimes receives
the deliveries. The company’s bookkeeper is not in the manufacturing plant
every day. When the bookkeeper is not around, those stay-in employees
receives the deliveries, wherein receipts cannot be recorded immediately
because once the raw materials arrive; they directly prepare it to start the
production process until some of the receipts were lost and cannot be
recovered. They added that, during the payment of the purchased raw
materials, if ever who receives the deliveries, either the bookkeeper or the
employees, they will directly pay in cash.

They have been experiencing an on and off production where they can
only produce orders twice a month. To continue the company’s production
they will borrow money, as short term loan, to add capital for their production
and at the same time, look for investors to fund their production.

The owner and the bookkeeper have a separate record notebook in
which liabilities are only recorded, while the sales invoices were not recorded
for the reason that, when the bookkeeper receive their sales she directly pay-

off their liabilities even without the owner’s permission. The company’s
10
liabilities came from their acquired loans that add up to their capital. The

owner also added that when the bookkeeper receives payments from their
clients, she will not be informed.

In the year 2013, the company started having loans amounting to
P1,000,000.00 to start their production. The company’s estimated short term
loans and investments are in an average amount of 400,000 payable within
6 to 12 months with a monthly interest rate of 10%. During the payment of
their liabilities, they could only pay for their interest.

The company’s payment process is consignment which is payable
within 60 to 120 days. In which, according to the owner, it is one of the causes
why the company keeps acquiring loans, to sustain their production.

During the collection of payments, the company sends a trusted
employee to the client to get the payment upon due date. And, only the
income of the products sold were collected, they didn’t include the products
that are not yet soid.

In able for them to monitor their sales, they will send a billing statement
to their clients, they also update them through text messages, phone calls,
emails and also send a trusted employee to inform the client about the
payment. It is done a week before the client's due date. If there is a failure of
payment, the company sends a notice to the clients that indicate they have
one (1) month extension. If the client still cannot pay the due amount they will
send another notice that indicates that within 3 days the client is oblige to pay

at least 50% of the due amount.
The company is now looking for more investors to fund their production
because they still have pending orders and commitments that were not yet
served. Their pending orders come from their current clients that were not
able to entertain because they needed to serve first the purchase orders from
their previous clients.

They continue accepting product orders from new clients for them to
retain their products in the market and also for them to produce orders from

previous clients and serve new product orders at the same time.

cooperative. Thus, the researchers would like to recommend the following:

First is that the cooperative should hire an additional collector within the

member. Second, they must fully implement their policy with regards to co-

makers. Third, they should undergo litigation process through filing a lawsuit

against delinquent member borrowers. Fourth, they should send text message

prior to due date. Lastly, they should create a policy on automatic deduction of

capital savings for delinquent accounts.

The delinquent member borrower was encouraged by the cooperative
as to what types of payment alternatives they want as to their convenient.
They gave option to the member borrower and also help the cooperative to at
least decreased delinquent accounts.

Most of the member borrowers preferred over the counter payment
because they want to personally pay their payments as well as received their
payment receipts. For those working member borrowers and to those who
have monthly pension such as senior citizen, retired government employees
and retired private employees. They chose payment through ATM because of
being busy with their work and to those senior citizens, they were not able to
went to the cooperative for the reason that they got easily tired. Payment
through collectors were for those member borrowers who resided far but still
within the community. According to them, it was hassle free that they would
just wait for the collector instead of going to the office. Post-dated check was
for those members borrower who have an account in a bank who would want
to issue a check to the cooperative with a specific date as their payment.

Further, 3 in 1 Water Refilling Station surrounded by commercial

buildings and some establishments like lodges, apartment, dance studio,
cooperative company, shops, gym, clinic, and eatery. The management stated
that they choose to rent a building in this place since it was near to many
establishments that could be the target market. At the top of the store is signage
with 3 feet by length and 10 feet by width. The signage is not visible at the right
side; it was covered with another signage of the store beside 3 in 1 Water
Refilling Station. The letters in the signage written in black have a white
background with a design of splash water that resembled the business. The
store has a service area, storage, and a production area. The floor tiles in the
service area are cracked, the empty and refilled gallons are stored together in
the storage area, and the production area is half covered with clear glass and
inside are yellowish tiles. The business obtains their water supply every night
from flowing water in Santo Nino RTR, Cabadbaran City. They accept delivery
within the Butuan City downtown area and near establishments only. Their
regular delivery customers are; Department of Health Caraga Region, Gaisano

The Water Refilling Station promote their business by giving stickers to
their new customers who visit their store. The label has their contact number
written on it for the new customers to easily contact them. Also, they give water
supply to Wild FM for free, and in return, the radio station promoted their

business on air every day at 4:00 PM for 30 seconds. They also used word of
mouth as their promotion before up to present by telling their friends, neighbors,

church mates, and relatives about their business.

The figures below show the annual number of refilled gallons being
disposed by 3 in 1 Water Refilling Station from the year 2014-2017 (Figure 1).

Figure 3. Annual Sales of 3 in 1 Water Refilling Station from the year 2014-

During the year 2013-2014, the price of their refilled water is 25.00 and
additional 5.00 per gallon for delivery. The manager said that, their water
contents alkaline that made them decide to set their price to P25.00. Also, the
business gives out flyers and spread their business through word of mouth by
introducing the company to their friends, relatives, neighbors, etc. The
management said that, in this manner, it would be a type of strategy to be
known as a newly established business. The administration felt fortunate for it
was a successful year on them for having a large number of gallons disposed

of and a large number of sales.
While, in the year 2015, the annual number of refilled gallons disposed
of walk-in and delivery customers decreased by 5,000. Pieces and their yearly
sales decreased by 450,000.00 During this year, the business discontinued
the giving out of flyers as well as they removed adding alkaline as contents of
their water. According to the manager, the price of alkaline is high that made
them stop adding it into the water. They also changed the amount of their refilled
water to 20.00 and still an additional 5.00 per gallon for the delivery. The
business also implemented a pricing strategy by giving P2.00 discounts for
those who want to refill 2 or more gallons. They also put a fluorescent lamp on
their signage to be visible during the night. The management mentioned that if
the signage is evident even at night, it may aware the customers who passed

by in their store that there is water refilling on that place.

Nonetheless, in the same year, they offer promotional strategy like ten
plus 1 in which in every ten pieces purchased of refilled water, there will be one
free. According to the manager, it is a way to attract customers to buy more to
get one free refilled gallon. The managementalso stated that they do not accept
delivery if itis outside the Butuan City downtown area unusually far places since
this could also be another add-on in their cost and expenses. From the
managers perspective, some of the customers started to order water to other
water refilling stations. The manager said that they ignore the situation and

thought that they can still acquire more customers.
In the year 2016, the annual number of refilled gallons disposed of walk-
in and delivery customers decreased by 4,000 pieces and annual sales
decreased by 100,000.00. In this year, the management implemented a
promotional strategy like giving out of stickers with their contact number to the
new customers. The manager said this is for their new customers to contact
them quickly. Also, they decided to put their business name, contact number,
and address on their gallons for their newly acquired customers to promptly get
in touch with them. At the same year, the management decided to discontinue
their 10+1 promo. According to the manager, the prices of the raw materials
(salt and sediment filter) gets higher that made them chose to stop their promo.
After implementing their promotional strategy, the number of the refilled gallons

disposed of still decreased.

As well as in the year 2017, the annual number of refilled gallons
disposed of walk-in and delivery customers decreased by 6,000 pieces and
their yearly sales decreased by 250,000.00 During this year, and they started
giving calendars on December to make their customers feel important. They
also cleaned their signage for the reason that it is already dirty. At the same
year, they started giving free water in Wild FM, for their business to mentioned
on air. According to the manager, through radio advertising, they might acquire
new customers. They also started giving 4.00 discount to their regular
customers. The management stated that it is to motivate the customers to refill

or order water to them regularly. However, during this year, some of the
customers started to choose other water stations which offered better promos

and lower prices.

"EVALUATION ON CREDIT MANAGEMENT OF
WILKRIS APPLIANCE CORPORATION
","CASE ABSTRACT

The study evaluated the practices of credit management of Wilkris Appliance
Corporation Butuan Branch on areas of application processing, credit
standard and credit monitoring. Descriptive research method was used to
evaluate the practices of credit management of the company. Purposive-
complete enumeration sampling were done, a total of three hundred nineteen
(319) respondents. Result showed that credit monitoring has the highest
mean of 2.4 while application processing has the lowest mean of 2.2 and both
have a verbal description of sometimes. While the application processing has
the mean of 2.38 with a verbal description of sometimes. The finding revealed
that the credit management practices of Wilkris Appliance Corporation was
occasionally practiced that is why the company have been experiencing an
increase of delinquent accounts which resulted to an increase of unpaid debts
of their customers. The researchers proposed recommendations in order to
help in minimizing the delinquent accounts such as the company must strict in
submission of requirements as well the customers filling up the application
form and verified through initial interview and investigation. Further must have
a thorough investigation and evaluation for a basis of approval upon/before
availing the credit, always review and monitor the customer's status in terms
of its record of collection every day, send a message 4 days to 7 days
before/prior to its due date, update/improved the website to have wide
customers access of information. Thus, the study helps to sustain decrease
delinquent account given the recommendation above.
","Case Overview

The business offers their product for cash and credit plans. For cash
basis, the customer needs to choose of what kind of appliance or furniture
he/she wants to buy and assisted by the unit sales manager. Customer needs
to fill in an application form, pay the amount of the item bought and delivery
takes after. On the other hand, for customers who wish to avail credit plans,
the customer also needs to choose what kind of appliance or furniture he/she
wants to buy assisted by the unit sales manager. Customer needs to fill in the
application form given and assisted by the credit investigator and submit the
following requirements such as 1 Community tax/ cedula (original/photocopy),
1 recent 2x2 picture, and 1 original proof of billing (Electric/water bill). The
credit investigator also provides another form to be filling up by the customer
which consists the following personal expenses such as home rental, clothing,
water and electricity, transportation, school, salary/income and others.

After filling all the necessary forms, the customer’s information that
appear on the application form would be verified through an initial interview
conducted by the credit investigator. The clerk also would discuss the policies,
as well as terms and condition. In some situation, during the absence of the
credit investigator, the manager acts on his behalf with the clerk. Conducting
initial interviews and even verifying the information to ensure the customer's
creditworthiness and its trustworthiness to avoid delay on application

processing.

When it comes to credit standard, the company does the same
procedure to secure the creditworthiness of the customer. They check the
credit history of the applicant who applied for credit if it stated on the
applicant's contract, if he/she availed loans from other appliance companies
and financing institutions. They let them fill up application form for customer
who are new applicants and review the previous accounts as well as their
accounts from other appliance company if any for old applicants or those
customers who already have records in the company.

The manager added that most of the time, those who have records
already does not need to go in a thorough evaluation since they can track its
previous performance. When it comes to customer's capacity to pay, the
company is imposing a 25% down payment which customers need to comply
such to get the appliance or furniture they want to purchase on credit. But, the
company gives value to customer relationship so most of the time they allow
customers to get the appliance or furniture purchase credit even without
giving any down payment.

Customers who are approve to avail credit are customers who shows
pay slip for those who are employed and physical store for those who are self-
earning individual. The company has no minimum requirement on income and
has no minimum requirement on the length of job stability. As long as the
customer generates income, then company would allow him/her to avail credit.

The company has assurance and security for their credit since they are

ee Aran
dealing with appliance and furniture this is serve as collateral when customers
fail to pay their obligation which is written in their signed contract.

When it comes to evaluation as part of credit standard, the prospect
customer would be evaluated by the credit investigator through the following
process; (1) Initial interview would be conducted by the credit investigator in
the branch; this is where the credit investigator questions the validity of the
written information on the application form aligned on the customers answers
to the basic question such as name, address, birth date, basic salary, and etc.
(2) Checking its residential address duly done by the credit investigator base
on the customer's application form, if customer really existing in certain place;
at this point, the credit investigator would conduct its 2"" interview on the
residential area in which he would ask the neighbors about previous credit
records of the customers. This is where the credit investigator would observe
the customer’s behavior and character in the certain place. Records on the
barangay are often considered when it comes to credit investigation. (3)
Credit Investigator would look for the pay slip (optional) of those applicants
who are employed and physical store or business for self-employed individual.
For self-employed customers physical store or business permit would serve
as proof of income. (4) ask for certain neighbors the credit worthiness of the
applicants; this is where the credit investigator would conduct an interview of
the customer's neighbor. During this part, credit investigator done this

surprisingly, no time given; and (5) Credit Investigator or Branch Manager's
final observation would be the basis of approval and disapproval of the
customer and it would be discussed by them.

According to the manager, if the prospect customer would be approved
by credit investigator, the customer would now proceed to unit sales manager
who would assist and enlighten them in choosing the unit depends on the
brand. If the customer already decided, the customer needs to pay a 25%
down payment to the cashier counter or even without down payment. In
addition, based on the credit investigator that there are times they passed
those applicants without undergone a thorough investigation.

The clerk would now take place to verify the payment; contract signing,
discussion of the contract covering from 3 months, 5 months, 11 months and
maximum contract of 14 months depends on the item’s price and releasing of
item. The releasing of item would vary depends on the location since the
Wilkris Appliance Corporation customers came from Jabonga, Buenavista,
Nasipit, the rest of Agusan del Norte and Butuan City area. For Butuan City
area, one (1) day process and releasing. While for Jabonga, Buenavista,
Nasipit, the rest of Agusan del Norte area, 2 days maximum of process and
releasing. Monthly installment will be imposing base on the terms he/she
Signed on the contract.

Table 1 showed the number of applicant and number of approved
applicants in the past five years. There are instances that some applicants are
disapproved because they sometimes give wrong information which leads to

misalignment. On the year 2013 to 2017, the total numbers of applicants were

54,390 and there were just 54,257 are approved. It shows that most of the

applicants who wish to avail credit are approved. This means that application
in Wilkris Appliance Corporation is easily granted and there is no instance of
cancellation from applying credit. On the other hand, it also shows that the
number of customers is decreasing. According to the manager, the company
has less effort when it comes to promotion of the company. Compared to
other appliance corporation, they are not that much known in the market and
barely dependent on the agents recruits.

As showed in Figure 2, number of delinquent accounts, Sales report,
gross remittance report and accounts receivable in the past five years on
appliances and furniture of Wilkris Appliance Corporation. In the year 2013 up
to the year 2014 the numbers of delinquent accounts are increased. By 2015,
it decreases by 0.19% as well as in 2016 by 0.13% yet in the year 2017 the

numbers continue to arise.

Table 2 showed, the total annual accounts receivable with the
corresponding aging for the past five years. It shows the division of accounts
receivable into different time brackets and ranks according to the terms which
includes in their contracts. It shows that the business is experiencing an
increase of accounts receivable in the past years that leads to a large
percentage of overdue accounts. Despite of the increase, the management up
to now is continuously allow customers to avail credit plans and still calling the
attention of these customers to pay their debts.

The management also added, for them to monitor and manage their
delinquent accounts is to provide compromise agreement between the
company and customer. The clerk will be the one assign to check and update
for the customers status that are near to its due date. They will verify if the
customers have been monitored his/her payments based on the record. They
check it from their program list of the customer align to its manual monitoring
table sheet that every customer has.

After they check, if the customer cannot pay the day on or before its
due date, especially to the customer that are usually pay to the branch to avail
the rebate, they would monitor for it. The management had procedures to
collect their delinquent accounts, collectors would prepare itinerary for the day
identifying due of the day and past due and on the day of its due date, the
Company would send a collector to their customer to update them and inform
the customer about the payment. Every after collection, the collectors would

give the payments and receipts to the cashier for liquidation. After clearing all
Be

a

payments and receipts, the cashier would forward the duplicate receipts to the
clerk so she can update the customer's record. If the customer failed to do
pay, considering the level of validity of reason, they would give a one (1)
month extension. If the customer can't pay its payment on the second time,
the company gives another one (1) month extension and_ that another
extension is the last chance of the customer who refuse to pay its monthly
obligation. On the third time of collection, and the customer failed to pay 1
month or 2 months monthly payment the company would force to recover or
get the product from them.

On the other hand, if customers pay on the due date, it would be
collected by the company collectors in their residence. After collecting, it
would be given to the cashier for checking of duplicate receipts if collections
align on cash on hand. After checking, the cashier would now inform the clerk
to update the customer's record of payment.

Collection is done in a monthly basis and cut offs according to the
following: (1) customers who apply credit loan dated from 1-7, due date would
be on the 8'"" of the month; (2) customers who apply credit loan dated from 8-
15, due date would be on the 16"" of the month; (3) customers who apply
credit loan dated from 16-23, due date would be on the 24th of the month; and;
(4) customers who apply credit loan dated from 24-30, due date would be on
the 30""or 31% of the month.

According to the manager, they give discounts as well as rebates. The

rebates will be granted if customer choose to pay direct to the branch before
12
its due date since collector would be collecting payments on the due date. If
payment is continuous, then the final bill would be deducted by rebates plus a

discount of 10% if the term is 5months above and 5% for 3 months term.

"CREDIT POLICY ASSESSMENT OF
UHLAND LOANS CORPORATION - MAIN BRANCH
","CASE ABSTRACT

This study aims to assess the existing credit policy of Uhland Loans
Corporation to come up with a possible solution, or at least to minimize the
current problem which is the increasing of defaulted accounts, and
appropriate recommendations for the company. The study focused mainly on
Uhland Loans Corporation Main Branch’s credit policy assessment under
Salary Loan accounts, its active clients in the year 2014 up to the first quarter
of 2015. Active clients under Salary Loan accounts who observed the
implementation of credit policy from New Applicant Officer to Chief Loan
Officer in the main branch are the primary sources of the data. The type of
research methodused in this study is Descriptive Research. The findings of
the study reveal that the credit policy is occasionally practiced that leads to
problems during repayment. Factors that cause defaulted were identified as
follows: incomplete requirements are toleratedupon submission of required
documents, ATM card was the sole collateral needed to acquire a loan which
indicates an unsecured loan. As Epstein and Graham (1991) pointed,
collateral reduces the risk of default. It must be that the company must have
to retrieve from the borrower when the loan is subject to default, the
unpracticed credit investigation through residence visitation must be
executed. A residence visitation verifies all the information provided by the
borrower, Journal Le Propriétaire (2011), it will be the basis of whether the
person is creditworthy, credit orientation must always be done before a loan
application to ensure both loan applicants and co-makers awareness

regarding the covenant they are about to sign into. The researchers
—_

recommend the company to follow the credit policies, conduct a thorough
credit investigation and credit orientation for loan applicants and co-makers
which help to avoid default risk, collateral must be provided aside from the

ATM card for a secure loan.
","Case Overview

Uhland Loans Corporation offered three loan products: Allotment loan,
Pension loan, and Salary loan. For the application of these loans, an applicant
submits all the requirements for evaluation. However, the company aims to
provide an efficient service to their clients with convenience on the latter's part

and to give them the consideration of their lack of requirements (i.e. 7 out of

10 requirements).

Evaluation of Requirements and Credit Investigation:
A. Salary
1. Duly filled out application form
2. Company ATM Card
3. Bank Statement
4. Company ID

5 Co-maker with an existing loan and of Good Credit Standing
6. Latest 1-month payslip

7. Any other valid ID (2)

8. 2x2 picture (1)

9. Certificate/Contract of Employment

10. Proof of Billing (latest electric/water/telephone bill)

As shown above, the only collateral needed for the loan is an ATM card
given that it is active and been deposited money continuously. After
submission; the new applicant officer will then receive the documents, do an
initial interview, and answer queries from the loan applicant. There is also no
proper conduction of credit investigation towards clients.

Once the procedure is done, documents will then be forwarded to
review its authenticity. The Chief Loan Officer will do the procedure. The
Operations Manager will further review the loan applications’ computation as
well as the status quo of the applicant. The CEO/President will decide the
approving/declining of loan applicants.

Once a loan is approved, a client can add on a loan but in this
r of that client is not aware and is rising conflict

transaction, the co-make

among the company, client, and co-maker. This condition practiced in ULC

and was continually taking part in their operation. Thus, when a loan applicant

has gone defaulted, a complaint from the co-maker takes place and is arising,

as mentioned above, conflicts among the three parties. However, such

been gone to waste, and the co-maker is subject to pay the

id that the company did not organize proper

complaints have

default account. It can be sa
aaa

orientation for both applicants and their respective co-makers since some of
them does not know the consequences after they signed the loan application
form. Also, co-makers must be a client, therefore, has an existing loan with
the company. Co-makers will receive an incentive of five hundred pesos (500)
given that the loan applicant has a term of one (1) year.

The credit department handles the indexes of the clients and can see
all the transactions, and they notice some client's ATM cards do not have
money on it thus repayment is not made. In monitoring accounts, thecompany
conducts an audit which called aging of receivables. Since ULC has only one
auditor, this process takes two (2) to three (3) months. This report will show
repayment problems from clients. The auditor declared the default accounts
and passed to Paralegal Officer for legal actions.

The collection of payment is done at the Cashier's Office only using the
company's Point of Sales (POS). Those defaulted accounts are handed to the
collectors after a legal action has performed. The function of the collectors is
to transact banks like deposits and withdraw a huge amount of money and
scheduled withdrawals from clients’ ATM Card. Hence, defaulted accounts

are not paid close attention due to other activities the collectors need to

perform every day.

"CASH MANAGEMENT OF GDC EBOX TRAVEL AGENCY
BUTUAN CITY
","CASE ABSTRACT

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cash management of GDC
eBOX Travel Agency. The scope of this study is within the vicinity of GDC
eBOX Travel Agency. There were only (2) respondents; the owner and
manager who were the knowledgeable persons of the operation of the
agency. This study includes areas in cash management namely; budgeting,
cash handling, replenishment and credit granting/monitoring. The method
used in the study is descriptive research where data were gathered through
oral interview and survey questionnaire. It indicates that the result of the over-
all rating is disagree, which means that the agency implemented and followed
the cash management practices occasionally, thereby resulting to fairly
managed cash.

From the foregoing findings, it was found out that the areas in
budgeting and cash handling got the lowest weighted mean with a verbal
description of disagree. It is recommended that in its budgeting, the agency
should handle its revenue or cash at bank properly by making it useful for the
agency's growth and sustainability. While in its cash handling, it is
recommended that when the load reaches its minimum level, reorder should
be readily applied to avoid further delays whenever the middleman has
System problems. If possible, it is also recommended to increase the desired

minimum load level to make the operation of the agency stable.
","Case Overview

GDC eBox Travel Agency is a sub-agent and has partnered with a
middleman that facilitates the operation of the agency and airline. The
middleman does this through a system (ticketing system). The system works
when the agency deposits the payments to the middleman and convert it into
load. The load decreases for every booking transaction. The period that the
load will usually update takes two to three days. When the load reaches
15,000, the manager will call the owner so he will replenish it again.

This minimum load to keep before replenishing is set by the manager
and not by the middleman. The maximum amount that the manager should
replenish is 50,000 which they can sell for three to five days. The agency and
the middleman have no written agreement, but the middleman requires
20,000 as the least minimum amount to be replenished. It allows credit to
government employees, regular customers and people who are close or
known to the owner. In a month, the owner replenishes it 4 to 6 times. The
reason of delay replenishment is when the owner is busy and when there are

no funds because sometimes credit is high. The frequency of out of funds is at

the maximum of 3 times per month.

The loan officer is responsible for promoting the product, selection of
Clients, conducting loan orientation, credit investigation, and loan monitoring. In

a date for the orientation together with the unit supervisor. In the orientation,
the loan officer and the unit supervisor would discuss the company's product,
product information, about the co-maker, its policy, the terms and conditions,
and the requirements to avail the loan to the new clients. For the old clients or
a reloaner, they are no longer required to attend the orientation for they already

have attended during his/her first application of loan, it's up to them if they want

to.

Every client must have a co-maker in which if there are circumstances
that a client is unable to pay, the co-maker would pay for that client and also
serve as a collateral-substitute to the client. The co-maker can be a client or
member of the group. After the orientation, the loan officer would give the
application form to fill-out and signed by the client and co-maker. They obliged
and required clients to adequately fill up the application form without leaving

and the requirements to avail the loan to the new clients. For the old clients or
a reloaner, they are no longer required to attend the orientation for they already
have attended during his/her first application of loan, it's up to them if they want

Every client must have a co-maker in which if there are circumstances
that a client is unable to pay, the co-maker would pay for that client and also
serve as a Collateral-substitute to the client. The co-maker can be a client or
member of the group. After the orientation, the loan officer would give the
application form to fill-out and signed by the client and co-maker. They obliged
and required clients to adequately fill up the application form without leaving
blanks containing the name, nickname, age, gender, religion, address, email
address, contact number, and reference with the corresponding address and
contact number of the applicants along with the personal information. When the
client is finished with the application form, the loan officer would be going to
review the credit application form of the applicant and give the requirements

and then do the credit investigation to confirm if the information in application
~~

input by the client is accurate. This process is called the Credit Worthiness

Evaluation.

To assess the creditworthiness of the applicant, the loan officer would
execute the following; Surprise home/business visit, Inquires neighborhood, do
background checking, validate the co-maker, and inquires information about the

client's household expense and household income.

In assessing the creditworthiness, the loan officer would base it on the
5C's of credit which consists of the Character, Capacity, Capital, Collateral and
Condition. In character, it would be based on the attitude during the orientation,
and also loan officer would investigate to the neighborhood regarding on how
the client deals on its previous obligations or liabilities. In the capital, the loan
officer would visit the business said by the client or the proof of income. The
capacity of the client to pay, it would be based on the client's income, if the
client's income is sufficient enough and can pay off its debt. The condition of
the client would be based on the status of a client. If the client has a business,
check the status of the business if it is liquid and solvent. For the employed
Client, they must present the latest pay slip and employee's ID. The company
did not require collateral because the co-maker served as the collateral in lieu.

The credit investigation would be conducted for only three (3) days to all
clients who applied for the loan. According to the loan officers, they no longer
conduct a credit investigation for those old clients, for the reason that they only

rely on the previous record of the old clients and that they have to review and
check the client's files to the company as well as the application form. The Unit
Supervisor stated that they do not ask for a credit report of a client from other
lending institutions, banks or a local retail credit bureau, because it is an
additional cost for their part and it is a long process.

Once the credit investigation is done, the loan officer would make a Credit
report for the evaluation of the client's worthiness. The loan officer then decides
who passed the 5C's of credit, then informed the client and asked for the
requirements. The loan officer would give the application form to the unit
supervisor along with its result in creditworthiness evaluation and requirements.

The unit supervisor would conduct a cluster revalidation to the clients.
The client would be given a question regarding the credit terms, policy, and
terms and condition. This process is to test the client if they know about the
product's information. After the cluster revalidation, the unit supervisor would
make computation and evaluation for the credit investigation report of the client.

The unit supervisor signs the initial approval for the applied loan of the client,

and there is a maximum amount of P15, 000 for every client in a group.

The branch manager signs the final approval. The branch manager first
evaluates the application form of the client and check if all the requirements
have complied According to the manager, they still accept and consider the
loan application of client in spite of the incompleteness in the needed
requirements. Then she would check and evaluate the result of the credit
investigation as well as to evaluate the ability and willingness of the clients to

Pay. If the manager sees the client's capability and creditworthiness she will

ot eae ARAR
11

grant the applied loan amount, but if the manager sees any incapability of
paying she would suggest alternative amount or lower the amount requested.
The loan officer would then inform the client about his/her credit limit and credit

terms including with its condition, payment terms, and penalty.

Before the loan release, the manager obliged the client to signed a
contract or an agreement that represents the client's obligation to pay the credit
to the company and then the group would choose one (1) member one to get
the check from the company, given by the branch accountant, and encash the
cheque from the bank partner of the LIGHT Microfinance Incorporated which is
the Philippine Business Bank. Upon receiving the loan granted, payments
would be made a week after the releasing of the loan. To remind the clients
regarding payments and accounts due, the company conducts weekly activities
such as prayer meeting and bible sharing as a way of reminding the clients to

pay their obligation since the establishment has no loan collector,

The loan officer stated that in every cluster, they should have to elect
Officers such as the president, treasurer, secretary, collector, and others. The
president of that cluster would be the one who is obliged to remind for the
weekly payments of his co-clients. The collector of the cluster would collect the
Payments from his co-clients and give the collected payments to their cluster
President, and after that, the president would be the one to deposit their

collected payments to the bank. During the cluster meeting, the president would
then present the receipt of their payments to the loan officer to record this as

the cluster's weekly payment.

Since the payment for this loan is made weekly, before the due date, the
loan officer would contact the cluster president to remind them about their
weekly payment, so that the cluster’s collector would collect the payment in
advance. During the collection process, if the client failed to pay his/her
obligation upon the said due date, his/her account would be then considered as
delinquent. Once the account is delinquent, the loan officer would follow up the
clients through text and calls. If the statement were not settled after or within
three days, the loan officer would visit the delinquent client’s residence to
personally remind her/him of the obligation to pay the due account. However, if
the account would not be settled within seven days or another due date, the
management would send a first demand letter. After two weeks if such
delinquent accounts are not yet settled the management would send a third
demand letter which is the final letter. If such actions are ineffective, the
management will resort to the court to issue a subpoena to those delinquent
Clients, for legal action and confrontation purposes. Once the issuance of the
subpoena has been made, the court would take action which is sending a letter
to those delinquent clients and the police would assign to deliver the message.
According to the unit supervisor, they have already issued a total of twenty (20)

Subpoena to the delinquent clients.

years of operation of LIGHT Microfinance Inc. According to the manager, the
number of their clients gradually increases as well as the amount released over
the past three years. As the data have shown from the year 2015 up to the year
2017, they have released an amount of 9,050,000, 12,500,000, and 16,000,000
respectively.

According to one of their loan officers that they felt pressured with the
quota for they have 400,000 quota every month. The pressure to meet their
quota influences the way they conduct a credit investigation of the clients. The
management still accepts requirements even if it is incomplete.

They only conduct three (3) days for credit investigation in which there
are times that the loan officer asks the neighbor about the client's background
and did not undergo through the income of the client. It also stated, that they
sometimes visit the said business of the client personally. They accept clients
as long as they are interested in the product and has an income of Php 300
daily. They allow co-maker that is also a member of the group in which there

are times the co-maker would not follow its obligation for they have their
i%

priorities. Additionally, they have never investigated the co-maker for they are

just only a member of the group.
In collecting the payment of a client, the client most of the time refuses
to pay because of different reasons like other bills to pay, tuition fees and

insufficiency of cash.

"COLLECTION POLICY OF BOHOL COMMUNITY MULTI-PURPOSE

COOPERATIVE
","CASE ABSTRACT

BCMPC or Bohol Community Multi-Purpose Cooperative, a satellite
office located in Nasipit, Agusan del Norte, with its main branch in Bohol, has
been experiencing an increasing number of delinquent payers of loan in the
year 2014-2016 transactions. Eventhough the cooperative has established a
collection policy, the cooperative is still experiencing difficulty in collecting
payments from debtors that will lead to slow loan recovery and may influence

the liquidity of the cooperative. The study aims to evaluate the implementation

of the collection policy.

The specific areas of the study are the credit reminders, monitoring and
follow-up, payments altematives and litigation. The respondents are the
employees and regular members of the cooperative. The researchers of this
study use descriptive method for the purpose of evaluation in this case. The
survey questionnaires serve as a way of collecting the data from the (50) fifty

respondents.

The researchers found out that the current collection policy of BCMPC
is rarely implemented and followed. They concluded that the cooperative is

lenient in imposing its collection policy.
The researchers recommend that the cooperative must apply litigation
against the borrower only if the

ré IS NO positive response to the credit reminders and monitoring and follow

ups knowing that filing a legal case is a long process and is very costly and
might destroy the relationship between the members. The cooperative should
hire a collection agency to pursue the payments of delinquent accounts. In
rewards for punctual or on-time payment, the cooperative should grants
reward at least 1% discount to debtors who will pay a week or so before due
date to encourage the debtor to pay on time. In penalties for late payments,

the cooperative must charge penalties of cancelling the credit line if the debtor

is not good payer and do not allow them to re-loan.
","Case Overview
In the year 2014, BCMPC Nasipit consists of one hundred and ninety
two (192) regular members and two hundred and forty (240) associate
members. In the year 2015, the total numbers of regular members are one
hundred forty three (143) and a total number of six hundred fifty nine (659)
associate members. At the same time, thirteen (13) had been terminated or
had withdrawn their membership; two (2) of them were regular members and
eleven (11) were associate members. In the year 2016, there is a total of one
hundred sixty two (162) regular members and seven hundred eight (708)
associate members. During the year, there are eight (8) members that were
terminated: three (3) of them were regular members and five (5) were
associate members. In total, there are eight hundred sixty two (862)
members: in which one hundred fifty nine (159) for regular members and
seven hundred three (703) for associate members. There are twenty one (21)
members who were terminated or had withdrawn their membership from
2014-2016: in which five (5) of them were regular members and sixteen (16)

were associate members.

According to the Officer-in-Charge, the reasons of their termination;
both regular members and associate members from in the year 2014 to 2016
aré as follows: members were not able to pay their loans, deaih or insanity of

the member, the associate member was not able to fully paid the capital
buildup of one thousand and two hundred pesos (P1, 200.00) within two
years, and or voluntary withdrawal of membership by the members.
The regular members can avail any types of loans. The amount of loan
that the regular members can avail is three times of their capital build-up or
any amount depending on the Capacity of the member to pay. If the members
would avail a loan with the amount below twenty thousand pesos (P20,
000.00), a collateral of a certificate of Ownership for an appliance is required.
A collateral of an OR and CR of a single motorcycle which is three (3) years
from the date purchased is required if the loan amount is twenty thousand
pesos to fifty thousand pesos (P20,000.00 - P50, 000.00). If the amount is fifty
thousand pesos to three hundred thousand pesos (P50,000.00 — P300,
000.00), a collateral of an OR and CR of car which is five (5) years from the
date purchased is required. A collateral of certificate of title of a real property
is required if the loan is three hundred thousand pesos (P300,000.00) and
above. However, if members do not have collateral similar from the above
mentioned, they can use an ATM card as collateral based on their income.
lf the amount of loan is below fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00) the
BCMPC Nasipit has the authority to approve the loan. On the other hand, if
the loan is fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00) and above, the BCMPC Nasipit
Seeks the approval from the main office in Bohol. To process the loan, the

¥MPC Nasipit will send the application of the borrower through an electronic

oJ

Malling after conducting a character investigation together with the borrower's

Personal information and other documents that are being required. It takes
ed

one month to process the application, If the loan was approved, the BCMPC
will release the amount of loan to the borrowers by the cashier.

2014. It shows that the total amount granted to the thirly six (36) regular
members during this year was four hundred seventy thousand two hundred
pesos (P470, 200.00). This figure pertains to the principal amount only. It also
shows that there is no number of delinquent account and delinquent amount
for this period. During this year, the Cooperative is using manual system in
recording the data as well as the Computation of the penalties and interest.

this year, the cooperative experienced a rapid increase in delinquent amount.
According to the Officer-In-Charge, it was in 2016 that the cooperative used a
computerized system to record the data as well as the computation of
penalties and interest. The computerized system will also remind the Officer-
in-charge as well as the employees who have the access of the system. The
reminders are for those accounts which have seven (7) days left before the
due date. The Officer-in-charge added that she had nothing to do with the
increase of the delinquent account for this year since it was automatically
recorded through the computerized system.

The cooperative during the year 2016 gives information to the
members about the system to the borrowers for their awareness. They
Conducted an orientation before the loan was released and they explained
that once the account has become delinquent, the system will automatically
impose the penalty fee of 2%. The borrowers from the year 2015 were
informed about the computerized system when they go to the cooperative to
Pay their obligation. Thus further, they hired additional account officer in order

that the workload would be done by the two account officer. In the year 2016,

ne Cooperative has two (2) account officers already.

Seven (7) days before the due date, the cooperative will send a text
message (SMS) to the borrower to remind the obligation. According to the
Officer-in-charge during this day the computerized system will notify them
about the upcoming due accounts of the borrowers that is due seven (7) days
prior the due date. She also added that she personally sends a text messages
to the borrowers. Sometimes she instructed the account officers to send a text
messages but there are also times that they did not send a text message to
remind the borrowers for a reason that they need to finish their other field
work.

Five (5) days before due date, the cooperative makes a phone call to
the borrowers especially those borrowers who did not give their feedback from
the text messages. The account officers stated that most of the customers
cannot be contacted through phone call. The account officers make a phone
call only twice, if the number dialled is out of the coverage area or no one Is

“nswering the phone, they just leave it and call the other borrowers. The

og —
“count officers added that they cannot keep on calling the borrowers sin

t
ney have other tasks to work on.
Furthermore, when the account is three (3) days left before due date,
the cooperative will make a written reminder to the borrower and it is to be
delivered by the Account officer. According to the account officers that some
of the written reminders was not delivered to the borrowers. Instead, they just
wait on the day when they have to Personally visit the borrowers’ residence on
the date, to hand the letter of reminder. They had to prioritize doing the field
works due to lack of time.

Lastly, a day before due date, the Account Officer will conduct a
personal visit to the borrowers’ residence to inform the borrowers that their
account will be due on the following day.

During the due date, the account Officer will go to the borrowers’
residences to collect the payments. The borrower could also directly go to the
BCMPC office to personally pay their obligations especially to those who are
living nearby the office. The borrower can also make payments through post-
dated checks. The cooperative may also use the capital savings deposit of the
member by offsetting it as a means of payment by the borrower. The Account
Officers stated that when collecting payments, they encountered borrowers
who refused to pay their obligations during the due date for the reason of cash
inavailability. The account officers also added that some borrowers chose not
to pay their remaining unpaid balances and others claim that their accounts
WEIE already fully paid.

If the borrower fails to pay its obligation on the due date, the account

cooperative
becomes past due. When the account becomes past due, the coope
gives ten (10) days grace period to the borrowers to pay their unpaid loans.
Once the borrower fails to settle the unpaid account on or before given grace

period, a penalty fee of 2% of the unpaid balance is imposed once the

account becomes delinquent.

When the account becomes delinquent, the cooperative will send a
First Letter of Notice. This letter is to remind the borrower that the account
was already delinquent and a penalty is already charged. This is to be
delivered by the account officers. According to the account officers, there are
instances that the borrowers will ask for favors such as extending their
payment schedules. Instead of sending First Letter of Notice, the Officer-in-
charge will just contact the borrower through text message or phone call to
those borrowers. She also added that they only send First Letter of Notice in
case-to-case basis depending on the situations and the reasons of the
borrowers for not settling his/her obligations.

When the account is eighteen (18) days delinquent, the cooperative
sends Second Letter of Notice. This letter is sent when the borrower made no
response on the first letter of notice sent by the cooperative a week ago. This
iS also to enforce them to pay their delinquent account to avoid the 2%
Penalty fee. This letter is to be delivered by the Account officers. According to

the Account officers, there are times that they will no longer send a Second

Letter of Notice since they have already sent the First Letter of Notice to the

Porrowers and they send letters of notice in case to case basis, in which they

officer also added that on the igth day the account becomes delinquent,
instead of sending Second Letter of Notice, they will just send a text message

to the borrower to remind them with regards to their unpaid balances.

When the account is twenty five (25) days delinquent, the cooperative
sends Third Letter of Notice reminding the borrower to settle his/her
delinquent account plus the penalty fee. This letter is to give information that
the borrower can make a promissory note with an indication of the possible
date of which he/she shall clear his/her account. This letter is to be delivered
by the Account Officer. According to the Account Officers, they sometimes
send the Third Letter of Notice since the Officer-in-charge will be going to
personally visit the borrowers’ residences for a verbal follow-up after 30 days
the account becomes delinquent. They have stated that they will just prioritize
to collect payments from the borrowers instead of sending a Third Letter of
Notice to the delinquent members.

After 30 days the account becomes delinquent, the cooperative sends
a Demand Letter. Further collection efforts are detailed in the Demand Letter.
This letter is to be sent by the Officer-in-charge to the borrowers personally.
An advice will be given by the Officer-in-charge to the borrowers on how to
Settle their payments. With this, the Officer-in-charge will listen to the side and

eason of the borrower with regards to their unpaid balances. According to the

Officer. up in accordance to their

in-charge, they will just do a verbal follow-

‘me availability and there are instances that they cannot visit the horro
residences due to a lot of work to do in the office. She also added that they
only send a demand letter depending upon the reason of the member for not
being able to fulfill its obligations. She stated that upon delivering the Demand
etter in person, they are supposed to do 2 verbal follow-up also. But because

of the lack of time availability, there are instances that they cannot do a verbal

follow-up and was not able to send a demand letter to the borrower right after

30 days the account becomes delinquent.

When the account becomes 45 days delinquent, the cooperative
should send a Final Demand Letter. The Final Demand Letter is to inform the
delinquent borrower that the account is subject to litigation if not been settled
within the given period. This will be issued by the Officer-in-charge, yet signed
by an attorney and an appropriate action may take under this policy such as
foreclosure, and other collection action. According to the Officer-in-charge,
there are times that they cannot follow the timeline of sending a Final Demand
Letter since they consider the borrowers’ financial condition for not being able
to pay their unpaid balances. The Officer-in-charge also added that they gave
another chance to the borrower by giving them more time to settle their
unpaid balances before taking any appropriate action.

When the delinquent account reaches in 60 days, the cooperative will

barangay settlement between the cooperative and the borrower. If the
borrower fails to pay even after the barangay Settlement, the cooperative will
categorize the borrowers into four (4); a borrower who has a delinquent
account of less than P20,000.00 that has a capacity to pay and do not have
the capacity to pay or a borrower who has a delinquent account of more than
P20,000.00 that has a capacity to Pay and has no capacity to pay. In the
case of the latter, there will be a court settlement. If the borrower will again fail
to settle its obligation, the cooperative would then charge off the account
when it reached the 365"" days. According to the Officer-in-charge, they do
not want the borrowers be held under litigation because the cooperative

aimed to help its members and that they value more the relationship with the

members. The Officer-in-charge also said that the cooperative has only few

in the last seven years. In 2011 and 2012, the cooperative generated high income
from agricultural products and services such as sales and lend of cows, hogs,
chicken, feeds, palay, rice, corn, coconut, and banana. However, higher costs in
feeds and veterinary pulled down the results of operation that makes cooperative
Suffered losses during the years. By the year 2015 and onwards, segment
expenditure was being driven upwards by higher travel and transportation costs of
cows, hogs, chicken, palay, rice, corn, coconut, banana to deliver in different places.
The second business of the cooperative is the Consumer Store. Table 2 shows the

results of the operation of the Consumer Store business.

Most savers are the officers specifically the directors, manager, and staff of
the Cooperative the rest are members and the students who live in Brgy.
Dumalagan. According to the secretary, savings are deducted automatically when
Staff and officers will apply a loan or before honorarium release. Mostly, officers

added their honorarium to their savings account instead of getting it from the
Cooperative. Students also save their money for the reason of buying cellphones for
their graduation.

By the year 2013 to 2015, the decreasing trends are due to an increase in
withdrawals of directors and other officers due to financial needs. Mostly, they
withdraw their savings when it reaches the amount of 10,000 and above. By the
following years, directors and officers withdraw an ample amount for the same
reason, but in return, they set aside their honorarium for their savings that make it
increase. According to the manager, when an officer is to celebrate his birthday,
other officers will share 50.00 each to him as addition to his shares in the
cooperative. The share capital is deducted savings of 2% from the contribution of
Officers.

The fourth business of the Cooperative is Loan Services. Loan services are
Classified into two (2), the Business and Regular Loan. Table 4 shows the financial
performance of Loan Services.

In the year 2012, the receivables had increased because, during this time, the

collector makes a dummy account as if availing the loan because he is the one who
made the Credit Investigation (Cl) and released the money after being approved by

the manager. In mid-2013, the manager found out the collectors doing so the
of the Cooperative, miscellaneous expense, and electricity. The cost incurred was
not that high that makes the cooperative to generate profit over time.

The latest business of the Coop is the Memorial Care Services. According to the
manager, upon membership they require all members to avail of this kind of services
for a purpose. The Coop insured member only when they die, but they never provide
insurance to members upon membership because if the Cooperative guarantees
them, they will always have an insurance payment to the members and it will be an
additional expense to the cooperative. If a member/borrower died, first, the
cooperative offset his account automatically and then if he is covered to the
memorial program, he will receive P60,000 benefits that are used for the nine days
of vigil, and if there is remaining money, the Coop will give it to the heirs. The
member that availed this service should pay ®250.00 every month until they reach
the maximum payment of P30,000 allocated for the memorial insurance and is
payable for 5-10 years. According to the manager, only 30% of the members availed
this service because most of them had already availed to other insurance company.
The main contributor of coop income was from the sales or lend of hogs, cows,
chicken, feeds, palay, rice, corn, coconut, banana in Agri-Production and for the lot
contribution in the Coop Village. The primary driver of cost was coming from high
honorarium being paid to the directors down to the employees and the feeds and

veterinary that was used for pig feeding and raising.

officer would repeat it to the customer for confirmation. Afterwards, the front
desk officer would give a form to the customer to be fill up by their personal

using manual process the customer would need to wait until the desk officer
done processing filling the registration form and get the payment from the
customer. The Inn would not accept credit card payment. After processing,
the desk officer would give the room key, and the customer would find his/her
room assigned.

Inside the room, there is a laminated copy of room policies hard

can be used for their customer if they have a problem or any concerns. The
Customer would need to go down and ask some queries, concern or errands.

would need to go out to find a restaurant or store to buy their personal needs
like toothbrush, toothpaste and etc. When the customer would leave the inn

the door and ask them if they are going to extend their time or not, if they are
going to extend, they have to go downstairs and pay the extended time.
During the check-out time, the customer would inform the desk officer and
instructed the room boy to recheck the room of the customer. The room boy
would give his confirmation to the desk officer if there is damages or missing
items inside the room. If none, then the customer can just leave the Inn. If the

Philippines that all banks, microfinance, and non-bank financial institutions are
obliged to give 15% to 20% credit on this sector that is commonly known as a
non-bankable sector. It was then followed by Salary loan because in this
program the company assures 100% repayment rate since it is a payroll
deduction scheme and it has a 17% share of the total exposure. Pension/atm
loan is a socialized program for the oldies in order for them to assure that their
medical maintenance and other health needs can be bought and currently this
loan package gets a 10% share of their portfolio. And lastly, SLP Lifeline loan
only gets 5% share because only those clients who had completed ten cycles
with perfect repayment rate can avail of this program since this is a motivational
program and given in a zero interest that encourages all borrowers to pay

promptly on their amortization in order for them to avail this package.

this period was rising based on their annual sales

According to the proprietor on 2011-2012 they used the same brand
and amount of ingredients as mentioned in previous years (2009-2010). Then
implement the same sales promo of their competitors by also selling five
pieces for twenty pesos of monay bread. The bakeshop raised its sales up to

1 million pesos compared to previous years based on their annual sales.

In the year 2013, there were competitors established nearby Earl
Nicholas Bakeshop namely; Rubies, Arbies, Rose Bakeshop and Pan de
Masa Bakeshop. The bakeshop encountered a problem with the hornero that
could not stay longer at work and resigned for personal reasons. In order to
cover the vacancy of the position and to continue the business operation, the
general manager decided to conduct an urgent hiring without giving proper
orientation regarding with their standard operation of baking. His action
resulted to improper baking of bread such as different in sizes and texture of
the bread compared to previous years, these are based on the general
manager, observation regarding customer's complaints. As an effort to have
proper baked products, he started conducting an orientation for the new
employees especially for the horneros. Old employees who did not have an

orientation and offered to stay-in with free water and electricity to use for all

By the month of May 2014, the supervisor found out that the cashier
was adding one peso to their promo which she would keep, by selling five (5)
pesos of each monay bread to their customer, instead of 4 pesos which is the
original price, when a customer buy one piece of five (5) pieces for twenty
(20) pesos of monay. Then the supervisor stopped their sales promo of selling
soft drinks and five pieces for twenty pesos of monay bread due to the
cashier's negligence on proper segregation of sales. Also, the baker,
lamesador and hornero during this month were stealing soft drinks. According
to the general manager, prices of the branded ingredients raised due to
inflation. In order to maintain the price of their bread regardless of the rising
cost of each ingredient, the general manager said they started to reducing the
amount of their ingredients in mixing and use cheaper brands particularly in
powdered milk, sugar, flour, bread improver, bread softener, evaporated milk,
margarine, vegetable oil (lard) yeast and stopped using eggs. And preferred
to buy from groceries every day, in order to lessen and utilize the production

cost. During this year, sales continually declined. (refer to figure 2)

In the year 2015, when sales were continuously decreasing, the
general manager decided to terminate one lamesador and one cashier to
lessen their expenses, low production of their bread followed. Then mandated
the hornero and the baker to help with lamesador in arranging and shaping of
bread to quicken production. Unlike in previous years 2008-2014, before the

termination of two employees, the hornero and baker were just focused with

their own assigned tasks. In the same year, the bakeshop continued selling

When it comes to customer service, according to the Earl Nicholas

Bakeshop present cashier, her Serving of bread to customers is slow

especially during peak hours. Customers would wait for 3-5 minutes before
being entertained, the fact that cashier is just one and she cannot
accommodate customers fast. Sometimes cashier serves the late customers

instead of those who arrived first and also serve the wrong orders, this usually

happened during peak hours.

According to the general manager, in regards to with the store
appearance, did not change; no renovation was made ever. The general
manager also, said that only Earl Nicholas Bakeshop does not have dining
area for those customers who wanted to dine in, compared to its nearby
competitors. He could not expand in the reason of limited space. However,

they do an annual repaint on the front view of his bakeshop.

When regards to the store environment. According to the Baker,
Hornero and Lamesador the cashier rarely cleans the bread display. The sack
used for placing the garbage invites flies and other insects to draw closer to

CASE ABSTRACT

The purpose of the study is to appraise the current performance of the
light equipment specifically cement mixer and generator and help the
management to create good decision making about the problem. The focus of
the study is to appraise the cement mixer and generator used by the company

in terms of its Usability, Condition, and Quality output.

Due to confidentiality of the identity of the customer of the company,
we don’t have customer sentiments. The respondents of the study is limited
only to those people who is affected with use of the cement mixer and

generator

The descriptive method is used by the researcher for this study
because this will help to appraise the light equipment specifically cement

mixer and generator.

The study reveals that the company’s cement mixer is less effective in
terms of Usability, Condition and Quality output. The effectivity of the cement
mixer affects the performance of the company because the cement mixer is a
vital part of the build. Cement mixer creates the materials needed for the
foundation of any horizontal and vertical project. It also reveals that the
respondents experienced in few instances that the generator is less useful.
Generator is an important part of constructing a project because generator
provides electricity which is used by the other light equipment such as
wielding machine in which wields the braces needed for the foundation of any

horizontal and vertical projects.

The appraisal of current performance of the light equipment has
revealed that the cement mixer and generator is less useful this could affect
the performance of the company because the company has delayed finish
projects. Continues use of the dilapidated light equipment will increase the

expense of the company due to rent and repair of the light equipment.

The researcher of this study recommends that the company must buy
more new equipment so that the company has its own back up equipment in
case of their equipment fails to work in the middle of a project. The existing
old equipment must be sell so that the company can gain profit on it or
convert that profit as an additional cash for paying the new investment. This
investment might be costly but this also gives the company to maximize their
profit lessen the probable cost that is increasing because of renting
equipment. Which could mean that the investment has the highest rate of
return versus the expense of renting if the company decides to still use the .

dilapidated equipment.

The Manager said that the equipment has still not on its limit because the
equipment has 5 years term that is why they did not buy new equipment and
still repairing those failing equipment. The company is spending 57,000 for the

Case Overview

In 2008, Delta was open for public with an entrance fee of Php20.00 that
includes free tour. They also have private service to pick up those customers
back and forth for only Php50.00 with minimum of 10 passengers from Sports
Complex to Delta Discovery Park. The Delta’s transportation service carrier was
a jeepney (Lawin). The Zorb Ball was also introduced together with the two
swimming pools. One is for children and another one for adult. The water in the
two swimming pools is fresh water that came from a clean river and the color
of the water is blue. They just put a net to drain the free flowing water and add
chlorine in cleaning the swimming pool in order to maintain the proper
sanitation. Delta also accepted those customers who wanted to have an
overnight stay at the swimming pool with the amount of Php150 per head with
free cottage. They have a lifeguard at the day and night that will see the safety
of the swimming pool users but they do not have any warning signage for the

customers to notice the depth of the swimming pool.

They have comfort rooms one for male and one for female likewise for
the shower rooms. They also opened their fish pond as one of their attractions.
The business focused on the swimming pool development since it was the only

swimming pool in the city that is not using chlorinated water for the cleanliness.

Year 2009 the owner decided to close whole month of October every
year to follow the belief of Chinese which signifies that this month is where

money is less fortunate to produce, but it was season of agricultural harvest

and the start of semester's break at school. They also put up private cottages
at the swimming poo! and karaoke for Php5S.00 per song. They have dirty
kitchen for those who want to cook food which is free to all customers. They
also offer coffee, liquors, soft drinks and some foods. In this year, the number
of customers decreases to 550. By the year 2010 the owner added another
service to entertain their customers which is the 400 meters Zip Line and they
offered 10 plus 1 promo during December which means that for every 10
customers who will ride at the Zip line, they will have one person or ride for free.
Only 77 customers availed the promo. This year the owner, Democrito D. Plaza
died, then the remaining family of Plazas decided to temporarily close the
business until the burial will be done that took almost the whole month of
November. This year the number of customers in the swimming pool decreases

to 450 and only 208 guests availed the zip line.

By the year 2011 they opened the 1.3 km Zip Line which becomes the
longest Zip line in Asia but they do not have the proper place where to keep the
Safety gear. They offered 5 plus 1 every Summer. Five persons will pay and one
will be free. Only 120 customers availed that promo. The 400 meters Zip Line

was still functioning and still with the promo of 10 plus 1 during December.

The number of customers reached 751 in the first year due to the new
Zip Line. This year also they added another service which is the ATV motor for
the other choice of rides to the customers to enjoy the moment while Staying in
the place. The month of March until August is a start of peak season. The
business experienced overflowing water in the swimming pool that’s why they

needed to wait 3 to 4 days to get the water level back to its operational form.
The Swimming Pool guests decreased to 384 while Zip line increased to 751.
In the year 2012, they opened their private cottages that are good for 2 persons.
Dormitory type rooms with a capacity of ten persons. Function hall was also
opened with the minimum of 100 customers but only 2 activities happened at
that time. The two Zip Lines are still open and with the promos of the 5 plus 1
every summer and the 10 plus 1 during December for the 400 meter. This year
the owner did not totally focus on the business because he took the opportunity
to run for a political position of the city. This year also, was the time that they
needed to close the park due to bad weather like typhoon. The number of
customers in the swimming pool decreases into 200 whiles the zip line 275.

And the rooms accommodated only 286 customers.

By the year 2013, they need to discontinue the water falls to save some
water since they do not have any tank to reserve water. The management
decided to close the swimming pool for a week every month. They do not have
notice to inform the customers that the Swimming pool was temporarily closed.
In result, some of the customers were disappointed for what had happened.
Only the 1.3 km Zin Line, 400 meters Zip Line, Zorb ball, Function Hall, and
Dormitory were available at that time. Also the ATV motor ride was stopped due
to engine failure and unavailability of some parts. The number of customer
decrease to 184 for the swimming pool, 240 in zip line and 230 for the rooms.
In 2014 Horseback riding was introduced to the customers for the replacement
of ATV motor that gained almost 80 customers. They have six facilities offered;

the Swimming pool, Zip Lines, Function Hall, Dormitory, Zorb Ball, and the new

one the Horseback riding.

All the promos that they offered for all the rides were still there. And the
zorb ball gained 48 customers. The number of customers in swimming pool
decreased to 157 while the zip line was 202 and the rooms gained only 180

customers.

In 2015, they took away the karaoke because most of the employees are
now working at a slow pace due to just having fun singing. The management
said that the Karaoke is supposed for the entertainment of the customers but
unfortunately it was enjoyed by the employees and it affected their performance
negatively and who are not responding the needs and wants of the customers.

Only one employee assign in that area.

In this year, the two swimming pools were drained once a month. The
management use alternative action to the swimming pool instead of fresh water
they use another supply of water which is the BCWD (Butuan City Water
District). They put chlorine to prevent the contamination of water and algae due
to scarcity of water supply. Mostly of their customer wanted to enjoy the fresh
water in swimming pool than the alternative. The number of customers in
swimming pool decreased into 103, while the zip-line decreased to 110 and the

room usage into 180. They also added mini zoo as one of their attraction for
the children. Different kinds of birds, a snake, anda monkey were the animals

in their mini zoo. The zoo was cleaned two to three times a month. They do not

have a specific person who is designated to maintain the mini zoo that’s why it

caused sometimes awful smell.

By the year 2016 of February, the monkey was rescued by the DENR
because it was reported that the animal was aggressive. It bit anyone especially
the customers. And for the whole month of March 201 6, the swimming pool was
not available due to plenty supply of water. By May 2016 the horseback riding
was unavailable due to the “Kutchero’s lack of maintenance to the wellness of
the horse. They sold all the horses to lessen their expenses. The ATV motors
were not functioning because the parts are not available here in Butuan. They

needed to wait their order from China.

The Zorb ball was temporary close because the air pump was not
functioning. In the year 2016, the color of the water in the swimming pool was
not the same as it used to be. Dried leaves are on the water. Because they
didn’t have net to catch the falling leaves. Still they were offering their promos
for the Zip line with the same prices but only two crews were available to serve
the needs of the customers. The customers in swimming pool decreased to 30,

while the zip line 80 and the rooms 76.

CASE ABSTRACT

Customer Satisfaction on its services offered is a very important concept a
company must understand in order to remain competitive in business and grow.
It is very important for companies to know and assess the customer satisfaction

because it leads to higher customer satisfaction, profitability, reduced cost,

customer loyalty and retention.

The main purpose of this study is to assess the Customer Satisfaction of
Cristal in terms of its Services offered. A survey questionnaire (rating scale) was
used to assess the level of Customer Satisfaction in terms of services offered.
The sampling technique used is The Purposive — Complete enumeration
sampling design. Purposive because respondents were selected directly from the
master list of active customers of Cristal Press and Complete enumeration
because all the Twenty (20) active customers of Cristal Press were considered
respondents. Respondents answer the questionnaire and assess the level of
customers satisfaction in terms of services offered of Cristal Press. In presenting
the result of the study, descriptive statistics such as Weighted Mean and
Frequency Distribution Table (FDT) data were used to illustrate the collected
data. The likert scale presented below is used in analyzing the data.

The company’s general rating of customer Satisfaction revealed that it falls
within the category of Satisfied which can be construed to be on the average

level only. This means that the company was not able to excel on anything but
\
df BUSINESS EDUCATION PROGRAM www.amaes.edu.com
{ HDS Building 999 J.C Aquino, Butuan City

no dimension is being rated less satisfied, all results however disclosed being
satisfied or just in the average level. The company can make better
improvements to reach much satisfied which is above average or very much
satisfied which is far above average.

This study recommends that Cristal Press should put more efforts to
improve its services particularly with emphasis on the five dimensions. Areas
under each dimension whose results are less satisfied should be given more
attention to attain satisfaction level. To elevate the level of Customer Satisfaction
from satisfied to much satisfied and very much satisfied add more machines
which is high-tech and modernized to be productive and to compete in today’s
competitive market. Management should determine training needs of employee
to acquire or enhance new skills, to enhance behavior and courtesy towards the
customer and to prepare them for higher responsibilities on the use of new high
tech and modernized machines. It will be an advantage of the company because
they can create promotions in terms of high technology used, a very productive
printing institution and a service efficient in terms of delivering products on time.
in this way the can now reach its objective of Customer Satisfaction and compete

in the competitive market of Printing Industry.
","Case Overview

Cristal Press had been providing services with an average of 20
customers annually like Vincare Pharma, Assets Credits and Loans, Guilmark
Trading, Philhealth, CityHealth, Mars Pharma, Barons Kinilaw, Aqua Care
Water, Red Cross, GY. Trading, BCCS, Butuan City Mission Academy, Andis
Snack Break, Barons Kinilaw, Gold’n’Pearl, M’E Enterprise, SmI Trade Center,
Brilliant Light Academy, One Corporate, and MC Enterprise who are availing
receipts, voucher, inventory papers, yearbook and other printing services.

Cristal Press aimed to accommodate the various businesses within
Butuan City. According to the owner their business was not really known to
everybody and never been the choice but merely an option. Aside from the
fact that their business establishment was not visible to the public, they only
had few loyal customers who kept dealing with their business. Some
businesses who once became their customers referred Cristal Press’ services
to others which served a big help to the company in terms of advertising. Most
of the time however, some businesses went directly to their competitors or

other printing press because some of which were easy to locate and perhaps

more convenient for them.
HDS Building 999 J.C Aquino, Butuan City

The company offers printing services through two types of processing,
the Off-set printing and the Digital printing. Offset printing usually time
consuming specially that it's manually stripping the pieces together and
making plates, while Digital printing was using computer and did not take
much of their time. Cristal Press had two offset machine and one digital
printing machine, but between the two they prefer to use the Offset machine
because it's cheaper than Digital printing. In Offset machine as quantity
increases, the unit cost decreases and the machine works on any type of
printing surfaces like paper, wood, cloth, metal, leather, rough paper and
plastic. This type of machine worked on high quality but limited on designs.
While Digital Printing had very short runs or quantity on print jobs which
usually incurred much cost but it can print on special paper such as finish or
unusual printing surface, or unique size. This machine has lesser wastes but
more costly than Off-set. Digital produced 100 receipts for about less than 2
weeks but with much higher cost while Offset produced as much as 100
receipts for more than 2 weeks with much lower cost. The process on the BIR
approval, numbering and verification were already included in the duration of
the printing process.
Based on the sales in the year 2011 up to the year 2014 of Crystal
Press showed that there was a relative decline of sales as compared during
the year 2010 and 2013 their sales increases. This can be attributed to the
election period where personal mattered printing of flyers, stickers, t-shirt,
giveaways printing were in demand. In the year 2011, 2012, 2014 and 2015

sales were gradually falling. Only their old and loyal customers keep dealing

Case Overview

ChowkingButuanJagno started its operation last February 3, 2014.
Chowking operates their fast food in 24 hours that offers different types of
food such as Chicken Lauriat, Siopao, Chow Fan, etc. Since the company
works 24 hours, the management assigned their crews or giving them
schedule on who will be allocated in the moming, middle in the noontime to
afternoon and graveyard from evening to dawn time. The entire crews, when

the operation started, was 38, all came from their direct hiring process.

Few months after the operation was started. Chowking continues
operating their restaurant, but suddenly the number of their crews is
decreasing due to their resignation with their personal reasons to leave the
company. They continued serving their fast food but due to the less of the
crews working. The management cannot handle especially when they make a

schedule of their teams on the day to day operation.

When the problem started, they make an urgent hiring, but
unfortunately, few only had passed an application or resume, so that's the
time when Chowking made a pian that they will contact the Tekton Manpower

Agency to give more crews that can work in the restaurant.

Few months have passed. Chowking management was decided that
they will hire crews referred by the Tekton to work for the company. When the
Tekton deploys their designated crews to the Chowking, only the Restaurant
Manager will interview them. On the next following day after the interview was
done, most of them have passes because they have experience. After the

result, the management gave them one-week training in the service area of

tig

the Chowking. Then on the next week outsourced crews started their work as

a crew.

The outsourced crews that working in the Chowking will be gradec
monthly by the manager and to be submitted to the Tekton to see their
performance level. Then Chowking and Tekton made an agreement that the
Chowking Company will directly give their every half month salary to the
Tekton that Tekton will have the responsibility to give the half month salary to
the crews. When outsourcing process conducted, they gain 51 entire crews
working. They continued Operating their product, and the crews do their jobs

as an employee.

Few months later, Chowking has raised concems about the
performance appraisal of the crews. The increased concern started when they
know that some of their crews are being hard-headed because they are
managing their own schedule of work time the reason when they got tired,
drunk on the past night that makes them lazy to duty in their regular working
hours. Then according to them, crews making absences with no reasonable
reasons for example, if they got their Salary in every half of the month, they
will do such as drinking liquors, having parties, having their rest after they get
the pay that this problem is very common to the company. The last concern
according to them is crew do not work well especially when their salary has
been delayed such as, they do not communicate the customers nicely in times

when the customer have additional orders and favors.

CASE ABSTRACT

The objective of the study is to evaluate Cost management of PAN de
PUGON, located at 1342 J.C Aquino Avenue, Butuan City (Franchise).

Specifically, on its planning, monitoring and controlling.

The researchers use descriptive method in the study because it

describes the cost management procedures and practices of Pan de Pugon.

The overall ratings of cost management in PAN de PUGON in terms of

Planning got the highest average mean of 1.90 with verbal description of
“sometimes”. Second is the monitoring which 1.86 got the weighted mean
with verbal description of “sometimes”. And the controlling got 1.55 with verbal
description of “never”. The overall mean of the existing cost management of

Pan de Pugon is 1.77 with verbal description of “sometimes”.

Based on the result of the study Pan de Pugon was lenient in its

implementation of Cost Management. Procedures are followed but practiced

in two to few cases or instances.

As a recommendation, the management should apply the production

principle “Buffer stocks” to meet increasing demand for the products; and be

applied during the production planning for breads and cakes. Apply also the

FIFO Method to avoid spoilage of the products. As to the planning, the

management should have a production plan that would serve as their guide:

what to produce, when to produce and how many to produce in terms of their

production. As to monitoring, the management should assign individuals,

Pan de Pugon has been Operating for Eleven (11) years. It was

established on September 30, 2005 and is located in 1342, J.C Aquino
Avenue, Butuan City. The recipes, ingredients and the prices of the different
products have been standardized in the main office. The supervisor said that
they bought the raw materials and ingredients in a large quantities in order to
get discount from their supplier. They make it sure that the expiration date of

the ingredients used are far from the time it is to be processed and be placed

in production stage. They also Said that the mark up price of their selling

cts is 2.5% va
produ © to the cost per unit in order to cover all the necessary

expenses like salaries and wages, benefits, utilities, maintenances and other

expenses that accrued in its operations.

From the year 2012 to 2015, Pan de Pugon faced problems in terms of
increased waste products like the unbought breads and cakes. To address
this problem, the management made alternative techniques on minimizing the
increased of waste product like breads and cakes. One of the measures they
applied is to offer the customer a “Buy 5 pieces of bread get 1 for free” or “Buy
2 wheat bread and get 10% discount for the third wheat bread”, while cakes
have 2% to 5% discount. However, they do not have enough knowledge as to
setting the proper promos and discounts to the particular products especially if
it is near to expiration. The second measures they applied in term of
inventories were that the management required weekend inventory of the
numbers of breads and cakes sold and the numbers of waste product. They
do not also apply the First in First out (FIFO) Method. In addition, the
customers want bread and cakes hot that are and freshly baked even if the
bread takes 5 to 10 minutes to cook the customers are willing to wait for it
even though there are still plenty of available breads and cakes displayed in
the shelves and refrigerator. As an effect, waste products increases. They
also said that if the customers’ demand for hot bread they will just reheat it
through the microwave oven just to satisfy the customers. The management

Said that if their breads and cakes are not be sold after 3 days they will

outside the city to reach their customer and maximize their profit. But due to
the given increases of waste products like breads and cakes that are
considered loss for the shop, the management are finding other alternative
techniques on how to minimize their cost and decrease greater loss due to

production waste while giving maximum satisfaction to its customers.

of data through an in-depth interview and data collected through survey
questionnaire for dine-in respondents. A total of fifty (50) were surveyed through
the use of questionnaires and interviews. The study employed convenient
sampling where the respondents of the Study are customers who purchased
bread in the store.

Brown Bakeshoppe. Likert Scale was used to express the response. The
overall rating of customer satisfaction of Brown Bag Bakeshoppe is 2.19 which
has the verbal description of Less Satisfied which is below the customer's
Satisfaction. The findings revealed that the design factors had the lowest
response in terms of customer Satisfaction, where the building painting is

already old and faded. For the store environment in terms of the ambient factor,
they should add more wall fans to lessen the temperature of the area, change
the busted lights and add more trash bins inside the store. For the design factor,
the bakeshop should repaint their whole store. In terms of social factor, the
management should have a proper uniform for their employees and conduct a

Proper orientation on how to handle customers.

customers who stayed in the bakeshop to take their snacks. It shows that in the

year 2013, it had the largest number of customers, aS well as the largest

number who consumed their snack inside the store that reached up to 35,000.
Based on the customer statements, the store looks new, the surroundings make
them comfortable and makes them stay longer in the store in order to eat their
snacks. During this year, the general manager said that they repainted the walls
with the color orange. They made sure that all the lights are in good condition
and changed the busted light bulbs immediately.
In the year 2014, the number of dine-in customers declined to 30,600.
During this year, the business received a series of complaints. The most
common complaint is the hot temperature of the store, because they only have
one wall fan that cannot lower the temperature inside the store. With this, the
customers are not comfortable in consuming their snacks inside the premise
and cannot stay longer. Another complaint from the customer is with regards to
the cleanliness of the bakeshoppe. They said that there are plenty of flies inside
the display case which would land, spoil and infect the bread. There are a few
that fly freely inside the snack area which would land also on the customer's
bread while they consume their snacks. The customers also observed that their
trash bin has no cover and the waste was improperly segregated, and which
produced unpleasant odor that would spread throughout the snack area. The
General Manager was informed of these complaints from the customers. Thus,

they decided to sanitize the tables and chairs before and after the customers

garbage into biodegradable and non-biodegradable is strictly implemented. The
trash bin was closely monitored and kept closed in order to avoid producing an
unpleasant odor. Upon opening and closing the store they ensure that the store

enough tables and chairs to accommodate other customers. On the other hand,
the customer said that the store employees were not well groomed, most of
them are wearing sandos, sleepers and all employees do not wear hairnet to
cover the strands of hair from falling to the baked goods. The store has only
one (1) cashier who cannot attend to all the customers immediately as it takes
a longer time to finish every purchase transactions. According to the General
Manager, due to the limited space of the store, they cannot add more tables

and chairs to the area.

Case Overview

Extensive Plywood Manufacturers Corporation (EMCO) of Magallanes
is engaged in manufacture and distribution of plywood for both domestic and
international markets. They have 300 factory workers and 6 office employees.
Their office employees received a minimum wage while workers received their
wage depending on how many finish product they would produce per day. The
company produces 2,000 panels per day, each panel has 300 sheets of
plywood. To have a production, the company needs raw materials to process
into finish products. The raw materials can be purchased either from local or

foreign suppliers.

EMCO Magallanes order raw materials twice a week for 4-5 ten wheeler
of logs and that order can be delivered 1-2 weeks after the deal. The manager
added that this order will be processed first into finished products for about two

weeks or three before reordering.

The manager does not review the inventory records when ordering of
raw materials. She only relies on the verbal report of the warehousemen. When
reordering, the warehousemen will report first to the manager that all of the
materials were processed into finish products or nothing is left in the
warehouse. In this case, the operation will stop for one or two weeks during the
waiting time of the supplies except for the maintenance department and office
employees for paper works. There is also a time that there is log ban,

the company cannot order raw materials. By then, the operation of the company

will stop for more than a week when there are no supplies and wait for the

delivery to be back.

In 26 years of service, EMCO Magallanes had been practicing reordering
of stocks when the raw material is at its zero level or nothing is left. The
manager said that the unavailability of raw materials in the warehouse causes
their operation to stop which also affects the workers of the company. According
to the manager, since this problem is not new to them and they are already
used to it especially the workers, all they can do is to wait until when the raw

materials shall be delivered to start the operation again.

The company does not practice the lead time for ordering raw materials.
Any time that the raw materials stored in the warehouse are consumed that is
the time the manager will process the order. The manager said that the previous

management practicing this one, so she followed what had been done for the

previous years.

and will be approved by the manager. Once it is approved, it will be sent to the
main office. The main office will process the orders through phone calls or send

introducing to inventory department, recording of stocks followed then

production will start. Inventory counting is done every end of the week for the

raw matenials and for finish products.

Recording of stocks is done when EMCO received the supplies from the
supplier. The personnel in-charge records the number of raw materials used
per day as well as the number of the finished product. Recording of product
sold is done every end of the week with the use of their receipt on hand. She
added that, with regards to receipt walk-in customers, they are not consistently

given official receipts since some of it bought for a little amount and others are

in hurry.

EMCO Magallanes do the physical counting of raw materials and
finished products. The person-in-charge will compare their inventory counts to
inventory recorded in their inventory software. As stated by the personnel in-
charge, so far there are no big numbers of discrepancies in physical counting
and in the inventory records of raw materials. It is just the products that have
been sold without official receipts that create the discrepancies in records as

they are tracing the discrepancies.

The practices of EMCO Magallanes in inventory controlling of raw
materials and the finished product is done in many ways. EMCO Magallanes
uses the stock card as identification of the number of the finished product only.
When the finished products are out in the warehouse, it will be checked

first by the warehousemen if the actual inventory with the documents will match.
Then the number of products sold will be automatically deducted in the stock
card. For raw materials, warehousemen do not keep on monitoring the
remaining logs. Cycle counting for materials is not also implemented. He said
that, as long as the production is going on, he just monitors when it is all
consumed to place another order because the important thing for them is that

raw materials are all produced into finish product.

According to the personnel in charge, the manager does not usually
check the inventory records. She just asks the in charge about the available
raw materials. The person in-charge also added that the manager does not feel
alarming every time the operation stops because they are used to it and the
manager’s reason is that they cannot demand the supplier to deliver raw

materials immediately or as soon as possible because of log ban.

if the company operates 30 days a month, they will produce 60,000

panels. The figure below shows the actual percentage of production and sales

from 2015-2017.

CASE ABSTRACT
Pixel.Exe Tarpaulin Printing Services, one of the printing businesses in
Butuan City, has been experiencing an increase of defaulted accounts from 2012
until the present year. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the collection
practices of the firm and after such, propose an enhancement of collection
practices so as to minimize the uncollected and defaulted accounts. Moreover,
the Sc's and the level of implementation of current collection practices are
assessed. The overall principle of this research is to evaluate the collection
practices of the firm that affects the collection of accounts receivables.

The researchers of this study used a descriptive method for the purpose of
evaluation of the case, particularly the collection practices of Pixel.Exe. Through
the survey questionnaires handed to 67 respondents and interview with the
management which served as the primary data of the research, they determined
the current collection practices of the firm. The data were obtained from both
primary and secondary sources which include textbooks, articles, journals, and

the internet.

The study obtained numerous findings based on the data gathered and
interpreted. It was revealed that the current collection practices of Pixel.Exe is
ineffective in a way that it contributes to the increasing defaulted accounts of the

fim. Those collection practices involve credit agreement, credit limit, credit

period, and consistency of reminders of the firm.
@ on. EE
HDS Building 999 J.C. Aquino Avenue, Butuan City

The researchers recommend that the collection practices of Pixel.Exe
should include assessment of the creditworthiness of the customers who
purchase on credit. The management should also involve the written agreement
which states the terms and conditions of the credit applied. Discounts and non-
payment charges are recommended for the recovery of the partial amount of
credit granted. In line to this, consistency and persistence of collection
procedures or practices should be applied to avoid the defaulted accounts. Also,
legal actions should be taken by the firm which demands the debtors of the firm
to pay. These measures might help the firm in improving their collection of

accounts receivables and avoiding defaulted accounts if they are consistently

implemented.

from the link between the debtor and the owner, the firm had no strict

Figure 7 shows a percentage of the defaulted accounts in which sixty-

nine percent (69%) of firm's debtor were regular customers. It affects the
profitability and liquidity of the business in which it could lead to lower

profitability and fewer opportunities to expand the company.

In extending credit sales, the firm has its current practices in granting
the credit depend on the type of customers. Regular customers such as family
friends will have a verbal agreement with the manager with regards to the
credit terms in the presence of the owner of the firm. Government agencies
are granted credit of they have documents written or encoded presented such
as purchase order. Pixel.Exe states and explains their terms and conditions to
customers before extending credit. According to the manager, the firm rarely

requires for down payment when purchasing on credit.

The company establishes credit limit of P10,000.00 to be purchased on
credit. Pixel.Exe allows the customer to purchase on credit with outstanding
balance, but they tried to consider the job stability and income status of the

customer before granting another credit or increasing the credit limit.

In extending credit, the customers are given 60 days to pay their debt
as a credit period of the firm. The client sometimes has an extension of 1-3
months after the due date. The company considers the length of the
relationship with the customer, the longer the relationship, the more extended
the credit period allowance and the shorter the relationship the shorter its

credit period allowance. The firm tends to charge penalty/interest to overdue

ey HDS Building 999 J.C. Aquino Avenue, Butuan City

accounts. Unfortunately, most of them will ask to pay the principal amount

without penalty/interest due to insufficient budget.

The company’s current practice in reminding of the accounts of the
clients is first through sending a text message every day after the due date.
The clients who leave their telephone numbers are reminded through phone
call twice a week. If text messages and telephone calls are not enough, an
email will be sent weekly to follow up their debts especially to the customers
who have had given their email address. If there are no responses with the
follow-ups, a letter will be sent twice a month to the debtor to minimize
expenses. If the debtor does not settle his/her debt on the credit period after
all the reminders are made, the owner will personally visit the debtor that is
one person in every month depending only upon the availability of the owner

of Pixel.Exe.

Based on the owner statements, he instructed the staff to collect the
payments the best way he can. After the collection practices were made and
still the payments are not collected, he instructed the staff to restrain the
customer from purchasing on credit. The last resort will then be the inclusion

of the client to the blacklisted names of the company. The firm established 5%

allowance for bad debts.

place just to force them to pay their delinquent accounts but still having a
variance of 18%.

he reasons as to why they still do not give a response to the

reminders for their payment; the account officer said that they only visit the
borrower's place when they have a scheduled collection near the borrower's
area. He added that most of the time some of the account officers cannot visit
to the borrower's place due to time constraints.

According to the account officer, the borrowers were given copies of
their amortization schedule together with the disclosure statement for them to
be reminded on their scheduled payment dates and their due date, and mostly
practiced as reminder than sending text and emails during loan release.

Having the bank's low collections, the MCCB’s bookkeeper said that
they consider an account to be delinquent the day after the due date if the loan
is not yet paid. If the account is been delinquent, the follow ups and litigation
will be imposed.

By year 2016, Travies General Merchandise practices are the same
and these practices are forecasting ahead of time was not practiced, regular
auditing such as physical inventory, spot checking and cycle counting was
sometimes practice. Buying new products depends on the general managers
wants but the difference is they purchased new varieties of products and
increased the volumes of these products as part of the strategy of the general
manager to attract customers and decrease the volume of the commonly
purchased products. The inventory level increases according to the general
manager. However, there was a direct loss of potential sales when consumers
tend to buy products they usually ran out-of-stock that leadsconsumers to
purchase items at another store or do not purchase at all. On the same year,
the general manager stated that only few of their customers bought and
ordered wholesale products from them, considering the unavailability of the
products and also running out-of-stock. The numbers of customers placing
orders at Travies General Merchandise were decreasing as can be seen on
figure 3. The general manager noticed some items were missing and damaged
that he considered it as loss. This situation affects the business that decrease
in their sales.

According to the general manager, forecasting demand of products
depend on their current situation and the changing preferences of the
customers. However, they only forecast the indemand products when
problems arise. Travies General Merchandise considered many factors in

planning for purchases such as what to order, when to order and how much to

order relative to the demand of costumer especially since they purchase twice

a month.

As to planning what to order, the general manager will list down the

items that are not available on the shelves. Travies General Merchandise
purchased products from their suppliers in bulk to get price discounts and for
them to meet the unexpected demands of the customers. Even though Travies
General Merchandise purchased products in bulk still the demands of
customers are still unpredictable that he never can predict when the demand
will increase. According to the general manager, their basis on planning when
to order the product is through visual checking the remaining products on the
shelves, and when he observe that there is only 10% from the overall number
of stocks of each remaining productdisplayed on the shelves, they will list the
items to be ordered to their suppliers through phone call.

He added that every two to three times a month, the business
experiences a shortage of the fast-moving product which leads them to
purchase additional products from their competitors and re-sell it with no
mark-up on prices, so that their customers will still buy goods from them
especially on customers who purchase on a wholesale basis. According to the
general manager, he spends unnecessary amounts of money on items such
as new varieties of products just to attract the customers regardless if it is
saleable or not. The number and the volume of products to be ordered depend
on the demand of the customer and the remaining number of products in the

shelves. However, the availability of cash on hand per month can also be one

of their basis in determining how many to order.

According to the general manager planning is only conducted whenever
he likes to plan or when the general manager is in the mood in planning, also
when he had available time to plan. He added that planning is exercised when
if it is needed.

The general manager controls the orders through listing the products to
be purchased. The quantities of those products to be purchased are based on
the ordered list and the remaining product on the shelves. Also, the quantities
of products to be purchased depend on the demand of the customer. When the
customer buys a product that are already out of stock, the general manager
will buy in bulk of that product for the next order in order to fill the needs of the
customers and to acquire price discounts from their suppliers. Shortage of

goods has been experienced when the products purchased from the supplier
are not available.

Ordering is done twice a month from their suppliers. The general
manager will base the order on what is on the list that was made prior to the
ordering date. When ordering these products, the owner calls the suppliers
about the goods to be ordered which is then picked up on the following day by
the driver and laborer. The payment for the order will be in the form of check
and will be carried by the person assigned to pick up the goods purchased.

Receiving of stocks is performed by checking the list of the orders.
During the arrival of the ordered products, the general manager assigns a

person to do the counting with him. The General Manager makes sure that the

items ordered from the supplier are complete as to what is declared on the list
and see to it that the purchase order matches the delivery receipt. If there are
mismatched items received, the general manager will inform the supplier to
verify the delivery and wait for the next delivery date for the replacement of the
mismatched items. If there are no issues with regards to the items received,
the general manager then marks all items as checked and received, and it will
be placed directly on to the shelves to be sold. The products of Travies
General Merchandise are grouped according to fast moving products and
slow-moving products, and are labeled with their coresponding prices.

Recording of items is done after the products purchased are delivered
to Travies General Merchandise. The products received are recorded by the
general manager together with his employee by counting and checking the
items ordered. A list of the number and the variety of the products are kept
on the record book through writing the receipts along with the date of arrival of
the purchased goods, its quantity, price and the time when the product was
placed on the shelves for display. He stated that sometimes he ignores the
defective products because he can replace it from the suppliers. The general
manager records and checks the items after having purchased a large number
of products then places it on the shelves. There are instances that there is no
accurate record or items received as to the time of its arrival since he had other
things to attend to.

Travies General Merchandise is using a manual inventory method and it

is done with a use of record book. The general manager said that, tracing any

variety of the product causes difficulty inidentifying the loss of items to its
actual count when conducting inventory at the end of the year. According to
the general manager, he tries to keep track of the record book of the products
purchased but if he cannot locate the missing product it will be considered as
loss in their sales.

Monitoring inventory record is not done in regular basis especially if the
general manager did not assign a specific person to regularly monitor the
inventory aspect of the business. According to them, visual checking of the
products available is done prior to the purchasing period. Travies General
Merchandise also has no regular basis on auditing for those products
purchased and sold and according to the general manager they have poor
communication within both the employee during the controlling operation of
products because of his busy time and the availability of the employee to
execute the operation.

According to the general manager, the inventory is done at the end of
the year. Listing the number of products remaining on the shelves with the
corresponding prices of each item sums up the total cost of the ending

inventory.

information and data are correct, current and complete. Credit investigation
takes place before the approval of the loan application. The collector would
conduct a survey to the credit applicant's neighbors to inquire if the member-
borrower is a resident in their place or if he/she has other obligations to other
credit institutions. The manager would approve the loan application form
based on the recommendation on the credit investigation. The notification of
approval or disapproval of the loan would be posted after seven (7) working
days upon the request of the borrower. Upon the approval of the said request,
the amount of loan would be released through the issuance of cash by the
cashier attached with the cooperative’s credit policies detailed with the
interest rates, amortization and the maturity date. If the loan amount is over

manager will make a recommendation letter and present it to the Board of

Directors of the cooperative that will justify that the applying borrower is

capable of paying the loan.

borrower's availed spare-parts since majority of the members of ANTSCO are
tricycle drivers and the demand for spare-parts is relatively needed. In
collecting the payments for spare-parts loan, the collector personally visits the

borrower's residence, but due to the nature and means of their living as a

tricycle driver, he cannot locate theme easily. So, the collector would just send

a message to the borrowers of his location and the borrowers would be the

one to look for him to pay their unpaid balances in spare-parts loan. In some

accounts including the previous year. On the other hand, some borrowers
would make a promissory note to extend the payment schedule of their
unpaid account; other reasons are due to cash unavailability and other
priorities. According to the manager, in order to maximize their collection, she
accompanied the collector and conducted a personal house to house
visitation to monitor and do a verbal follow-up to the member-borrowers with

all vacant staff in their office to put on filed and help the only collector in

collecting the unpaid accounts.

borrowers in able to minimize their existing overdue accounts. ANTSCO still
accepts small amounts of payment from the debtors with at least one hundred

When the account is 30 days delinquent, the cooperative would send
the First Collection Notice. This letter is to remind the borrower that the
account was already delinquent. There are times where the members would
verbally ask favors in regards with their unpaid balances. According to the
manager, due to limited number of employees, the only collector of the
cooperative couldn’t handle and visit all the delinquent accounts one by one.
She added that even the collector is task to present the Collection Daily
Remittance Report, there were times that the collector won’t able to pass the

said report.

Once the cooperative didn’t receive any response from the borrower,
the Second Collection Notice would be sent between 31-60 days after the due
date. According to the collector, there are instances that the borrowers would
just provide a promissory note to able to extend their payment schedules. If
the borrower made no response to the second letter: the Third Collection
Notice would be given by the cooperative where legal action such as
barangay settlements or court settlement would proceed 90 days after the
account have been deemed delinquent. According to the collector, other
various reasons for non-payment of accounts are: borrowers only pay
depending on cash availability, some borrowers refused to pay their remaining
balances because of financial difficulty, borrowers forgot the collection date
due to busy schedule and the inability of the collector to find the borrower due

to sudden transfer of location.

Signages of the gym do not only serve as a directional guide, but it
also serves as the identification of the business. The directional signage
of the gym is placed outside the compound where the gym is located. It
has a long rusted old alloy tube that serves as its pillar, with an old
rusted thin steel sheet which has ""We Care Fitness Gym” written on it
inside the old wooden frame. Inside the gym, there are also signages
posted on the walls that serve as instructional posters, such as; what to
do before using the gym equipment, the proper posture, correct way of
using the gym equipment, ""no shoes, no workout"" of posters, and gym
hours. However, their comfort room and fitting room do not have
signages, and they do not have any posters and pictures of bodybuilders
that can serve as motivation and a sign that the place is made for
bodybuilding and working out.

metal screen in it. The floor size of the gym is approximately 58.5 square
meters with a 6 meters height from the floor to the ceiling of the gym.

LIGHT MICROFINANCE INCORPORATED BUTUAN BRANCH
","CASE ABSTRACT

The study evaluated the practices of credit management of LIGHT
Microfinance Incorporated in Brgy. San Ignacio Montilla Blvd. Butuan Branch
on areas of credit application, investigation, and approval. The descriptive
research method was used to evaluate the practices of the credit management
of the company. This study employed purposive-complete enumeration
sampling where the respondents are the employees who were involved in the
credit management and used a purposive-convenience sampling method to a
total of one hundred eighty-two (182) clients of LIGHT Microfinance as
respondents. The result showed that as perceived by the employee under credit
application and credit investigation has the average mean of 2.47 with a verbal
description of sometimes while as seen by the clients it has the average
weighted mean of 2.48 with a verbal description of sometimes. The findings
further revealed that the credit management practices of LIGHT Microfinance
Incorporated were occasionally practiced that contribute to their problem of an
increase of delinquent accounts. The researchers proposed recommendations
to minimize the problem of delinquent accounts. Recommendations include the
following: the company must strictly require the clients to submit all the needed
requirements as well as to conduct a loan orientation for new and old clients.
Furthermore the client must have a co-maker that should be a non-client of the
company, must have a thorough investigation to have a firm basis in the
decision of granting loans or not, must hire or assign a collector, must review,
update and reevaluate the old client’s creditworthiness, and charge a penalty

for late payments.

The table below showed the three products of LIGHT Microfinance

Incorporated. Among of the three products majority of the clients availed the

multi-purpose loan with the corresponding number of a delinquent account of
334 amounting to Php 9,900,000.

Microenterprise Loan

The Multi-purpose loan is a group of loan which composed a minimum
of 20 individuals per cluster up a maximum of 40 individuals. This loan has 3%
monthly interest, and payments are weekly. The purpose of this loan is to aid
the growth and expansion of a micro-enterprise, to finance the home

renovation, pay off liabilities, for education and other purposes.

The loan officer is responsible for promoting the product, selection of

_ Clients, conducting loan orientation, credit investigation, and loan monitoring. In
the selection of clients, the loan officer would promote the product to a certain
area and if there is a person who is interested and wants to avail the product it
would be accountable to gather more clients. The criteria of a client it should be

18-63 years old, must have a business or job, and a permanent resident or
address. If the person has gathered a minimum of twenty (20) individuals, it can
now contact the loan officer for the orientation. The loan officer would then set
a date for the orientation together with the unit supervisor. In the orientation,
the loan officer and the unit supervisor would discuss the company's product,
product information, about the co-maker, its policy, the terms and conditions,
and the requirements to avail the loan to the new clients. For the old clients or
a reloaner, they are no longer required to attend the orientation for they already
have attended during his/her first application of loan, it's up to them if they want

to.

Every client must have a co-maker in which if there are circumstances
that a client is unable to pay, the co-maker would pay for that client and also
serve as a Collateral-substitute to the client. The co-maker can be a client or
member of the group. After the orientation, the loan officer would give the
application form to fill-out and signed by the client and co-maker. They obliged
and required clients to adequately fill up the application form without leaving
blanks containing the name, nickname, age, gender, religion, address, email
address, contact number, and reference with the corresponding address and
contact number of the applicants along with the personal information. When the
client is finished with the application form, the loan officer would be going to
review the credit application form of the applicant and give the requirements

and then do the credit investigation to confirm if the information in application

input by the client is accurate. This process is called the Credit Worthiness

Evaluation.

To assess the creditworthiness of the applicant, the loan officer would
execute the following; Surprise home/business visit, Inquires neighborhood, do
background checking, validate the co-maker, and inquires information about the

client's household expense and household income.

In assessing the creditworthiness, the loan officer would base it on the
5C's of credit which consists of the Character, Capacity, Capital, Collateral and
Condition. In character, it would be based on the attitude during the orientation,
and also loan officer would investigate to the neighborhood regarding on how
the client deals on its previous obligations or liabilities. In the capital, the loan
officer would visit the business said by the client or the proof of income. The
capacity of the client to pay, it would be based on the client's income, if the
client's income is sufficient enough and can pay off its debt. The condition of
the client would be based on the status of a client. If the client has a business,
check the status of the business if it is liquid and solvent. For the employed
client, they must present the latest pay slip and employee's 1D. The company
did not require collateral because the co-maker served as the collateral in lieu.

The credit investigation would be conducted for only three (3) days to all
clients who applied for the loan. According to the loan officers, they no longer
conduct a credit investigation for those old clients, for the reason that they only

rely on the previous record of the old clients and that they have to review and

check the client's files to the company as well as the application form. The Unit
Supervisor stated that they do not ask for a credit report of a client from other
lending institutions, banks or a local retail credit bureau, because it is an
additional cost for their part and it is a long process.

Once the credit investigation is done, the loan officer would make a credit
report for the evaluation of the client's worthiness. The loan officer then decides
who passed the 5C's of credit, then informed the client and asked for the
requirements. The loan officer would give the application form to the unit
supervisor along with its result in creditworthiness evaluation and requirements.

The unit supervisor would conduct a cluster revalidation to the clients.
The client would be given a question regarding the credit terms, policy, and
terms and condition. This process is to test the client if they know about the
product's information. After the cluster revalidation, the unit supervisor would
make computation and evaluation for the credit investigation report of the client.
The unit supervisor signs the initial approval for the applied loan of the client,

and there is a maximum amount of P15, 000 for every client in a group.

The branch manager signs the final approval. The branch manager first
evaluates the application form of the client and check if all the requirements
have complied According to the manager, they still accept and consider the
loan application of client in spite of the incompleteness in the needed
requirements. Then she would check and evaluate the result of the credit
investigation as well as to evaluate the ability and willingness of the clients to

pay. If the manager sees the client's capability and creditworthiness she will

grant the applied loan amount, but if the manager sees any incapability of
paying she would suggest alternative amount or lower the amount requested.
The loan officer would then inform the client about his/her credit limit and credit

terms including with its condition, payment terms, and penalty.

Before the loan release, the manager obliged the client to signed a
contract or an agreement that represents the client's obligation to pay the credit
to the company and then the group would choose one (1) member one to get
the check from the company, given by the branch accountant, and encash the
cheque from the bank partner of the LIGHT Microfinance Incorporated which is
the Philippine Business Bank. Upon receiving the loan granted, payments
would be made a week after the releasing of the loan. To remind the clients
regarding payments and accounts due, the company conducts weekly activities
such as prayer meeting and bible sharing as a way of reminding the clients to

pay their obligation since the establishment has no loan collector,

The loan officer stated that in every cluster, they should have to elect
officers such as the president, treasurer, secretary, collector, and others. The
president of that cluster would be the one who is obliged to remind for the
weekly payments of his co-clients. The collector of the cluster would collect the
payments from his co-clients and give the collected payments to their cluster
president, and after that, the president would be the one to deposit their

collected payments to the bank. During the cluster meeting, the president would

then present the receipt of their payments to the loan officer to record this as

the cluster's weekly payment.

Since the payment for this loan is made weekly, before the due date, the
loan officer would contact the cluster president to remind them about their
weekly payment, so that the clusters collector would collect the payment in
advance. During the collection process, if the client failed to pay his/her
obligation upon the said due date, his/her account would be then considered as
delinquent. Once the account is delinquent, the loan officer would follow up the
clients through text and calls. If the statement were not settled after or within
three days, the loan officer would visit the delinquent client’s residence to
personally remind her/him of the obligation to pay the due account. However, if
the account would not be settled within seven days or another due date, the
management would send a first demand letter. After two weeks if such
delinquent accounts are not yet settled the management would send a third
demand letter which is the final letter. If such actions are ineffective, the
management will resort to the court to issue a subpoena to those delinquent
clients, for legal action and confrontation purposes. Once the issuance of the
subpoena has been made, the court would take action which is sending a letter
to those delinquent clients and the police would assign to deliver the message.
According to the unit supervisor, they have already issued a total of twenty (20)

subpoena to the delinquent clients.

years of operation of LIGHT Microfinance Inc. According to the manager, the

number of their clients gradually increases as well as the amount released over
the past three years. As the data have shown from the year 2015 up to the year
2017, they have released an amount of 9,050,000, 12,500,000, and 16,000,000
respectively.

According to one of their loan officers that they felt pressured with the
quota for they have 400,000 quota every month. The pressure to meet their
quota influences the way they conduct a credit investigation of the clients. The
management still accepts requirements even if it is incomplete.

They only conduct three (3) days for credit investigation in which there
are times that the loan officer asks the neighbor about the client's background
and did not undergo through the income of the client. It also stated, that they
sometimes visit the said business of the client personally. They accept clients
as long as they are interested in the product and has an income of Php 300
daily. They allow co-maker that is also a member of the group in which there

are times the co-maker would not follow its obligation for they have their

priorities. Additionally, they have never investigated the co-maker for they are
just only a member of the group.
In collecting the payment of a client, the client most of the time refuses
to pay because of different reasons like other bills to pay, tuition fees and
insufficiency of cash.

"EVALUATION ON CREDIT AND COLLECTION PRACTICES OF
FUNDLINE FINANCE CORPORATION BUTUAN BRANCH
","CASE ABSTRACT

The Evaluation of Credit and Collection Practices of Fundline Finance
Corporation Butuan City Branch was assessed. The study aimed to evaluate
credit and collection practices based on a credit application, credit
investigation, credit approval, credit terms, and collection policy. While the
study used the descriptive method and purposive-complete enumeration. A
total of nine (9) respondents were subjected. Moreover, a four-point Likert
Scale was also used to interpret and analyze the data gathered. Results
showed that the highest average mean 3.06 with a verbal description of Often
under the area of credit application. It was followed by an average mean of
280 with a verbal description of Often under collection policy area. An
average mean of 2.71 with a verbal description of Often under the credit
approval area was on the third line. The second lowest average mean was
2 31 with a verbal description of Sometimes under credit application area. The
lowest mean was 1.64 with a verbal description of Never under the domain of
credit term. It indicates that Fundline Finance Corporation was lenient in its
implementation of credit and collection policy. Therefore, they need proper
implementation following their manual so that the company would not
experience high delinquency accounts. The researchers recommend that the
corporation must have an appropriate designation of work of the employees to
separate the workplace of each employee. Also, the corporation should hire
more financial consultants to become efficient in collecting everyday payment
and delinquent accounts. In rewards for early payment, the corporation should
grant a discount to customers who would pay on time or before the due date.
For the late paying customer, the corporation should charge penalties by
canceling their credit line and do not allow them to re-loan. Thus, evaluating
credit and collection practices is useful in a financial institution to increase the

cash inflow of the business.

Case Overview

Fundline Finance Corporation was established to provide financing
services to its customers. They offer loan to finance existing businesses
regardless of the years of operation. If the customers want to avail the
services of the corporation, he/she will go directly to the office.

The loanable amount offers from 8,000 to ®250,000. For the loanable
amount below 10,000, the corporation does not require a co-maker while the
loanable amount 10,000 and above the corporation would require a co-
maker. There are two (2) types of their co-maker, the co-maker A is the
distant relative of the customer (e.g., third degree relatives) and the co-maker
B is anyone that the customer wants to be his/her co-maker except for his
spouse, as long as he/she has the capacity to pay.

In applying for the loan, the customer would fill up the forms for loan
application assisted by the secretary. The customer must also submit all
requirements and personal data like barangay permit or Mayor's license, BIR
permit, any valid 1.D, and 2x2 picture. The corporation would also discuss to
the customer when a customer is not able to pay his/her obligation; the
corporation has the right get the home appliance indicated in the agreement
especially for those customers whose loanable amount is P10,000.00 and
above. The secretary reviewed the forms, documents, and requirements of
the customers if it is complete or not. Moreover, they also conduct a personal

interview with the customer because it cen help them cig more information
about the customers’ background information and elso it can build a2
customer-employee relationship.

Once it is completed, the loan application form together with the
documents submitted would be forwarded to the financial consultant io take
action for a background investigation. The financial consultant will visit the
area of the business for inspection as a part of their loan investigation process
to ensure if it is existing and operational. If they can see that the customer
cannot pay they would not continue the loan application of the customer.
Moreover, if it is an old account, they would not conduct another investigation.
They believe that these customers are trustworthy and had already proved to
pay their obligation. It took three to five days in conducting credit investigation.

After the credit investigation, the financial consultant would submit the
credit investigation report to the officer-in-charge to evaluate further the
customers worthiness and also to give a commanding approval. The officer-
in-charge must have a careful evaluation of the customer if they are well worth
for providing financial support from the Fundline Finance Corporation. Also,
they do not require a credit reference in approving the loan since they only
focus on the necessary documents that the customer must submit. Once the

application is finalized and already approved by the officer-in-charge, it would
be sent to the central office through mailing for final approval. When the main
office agreed to the desired amount of the customer applied for, the secretary
would call the customer to inform that their loan was accepted and order them

to go to the office to talk personally and discuss the terms of credit. However,
if the central office would not approve the desired loanable amount of the
customer, they would lower the loanable amount and the secretary would
inform the customer about the loan applied. If the customer would agree the

approved amount, the cash custodian would immediately release the loan

checks.

The loan is payable within 100 days. The corporation deducted in
advance an interest of 16% per term upon releasing the loan. The loan would
be collected daily including Sunday.

The financial consultant would start the collection every day after the
loan was released. When a customer missed three (3) payment during the
term, a computerized system would automatically print out the name of the
customer and the first letter of notice. The first letter of notification contains
the name of the customer, address and the amount of the missed payment.
This is a friendly reminder to customers to repay their outstanding balances. If
the customer neglects the first letter of notice and there are no payments
received by the corporation, the second letter of advice would be sent to the
customer and also to the co-maker if there is a co-maker required upon the

application. It serves as a follow up reminder after issuing the first payment
reminder letter, and the tone should be direct than the first. It contains the
amount of the loan and the missed payments of the customer. If the
customers and the co-maker if applicable, still have no action taken with the
letter of second notice, the third letter would be generated by the corporation,

and it would be delivered by the Officer-in-charge personally. It contains the
amount of loan, the missed payment of the customer and the days that the
customers did not pay.

This letter would serve as a warning for the last chance of the customer
to settle his payments before the corporation would take legal action. If the
customer will not settle the obligation, the Attorney's letter would be sent to
the customer and legal action would be taken through a court settlement. The
Officer-In-Charge stated that they would no longer be prioritized to collect
default since it is just additional work for them and it would be better if they
focus on the new accounts only. Moreover, if the customer moves out from
their location without informing the corporation about their new current
addresses and if the customer experience a fortuitous event like sudden
death the corporation will not prioritize to have a settlement instead they focus
on collecting the new accounts.

Table 1 showed the amount of loan released with the total number of
customer. According to the Officer-in-charge, for the first three years (2013-
2015) they have ten areas with the total number of 1,515 customers. The
corporation had released the total amount of 60,000,000 for the three (3)
years to help and finance the existing businesses. During this year the Officer-
in-charge also stated that some of the financial consultants did not remit the
money they collected. These result in the decision to lessen their areas during

the year 2016. Besides, for the year 2016-2017 the corporation has only four

away when their account gets overdue. There are customers who declared
bankruptcy of their business and changed their location. In this situation, they
get the appliances stated in the agreement during the loan application. As

customer to pay their debts and as an additional collection. Besides, financial
consultants maintain a healthy work relationship with the customers. In the
event, a customer is short on cash they would likely prioritize those
companies with whom the customer has a positive correlation does not have

a choice but to accept the reasons of some customers.

MULTI-PURPOSE COOPERATIVE IN BRGY. DUMALAGAN, BUTUAN
CITY
","CASE ABSTRACT

The researchers conducted a study entitled Evaluation on the Business
Performance of Malambuon Multi-Purpose Cooperative in Brgy. Dumalagan, Butuan
City. Well, assessed Homogenous Purposive Sampling Method was used for
gathering data. A modified survey questionnaire was developed, and a frequency
distribution table was used for the weighted mean and used a Likert Scale to analyze
data. There were 134 sample questionnaires for the member and 22 sample
questionnaires for the management staff employed during the study. The study was
conducted from June up to December 2018. The result of the evaluation showed that

of the cooperative. It results that in terms of Customer's perspective and Learning
and growth perspective the management staff and coop members are both
contented and satisfied with the performance of the cooperative. However, if this will
continue it will create dissatisfaction to the members because some of their wants
and needs are not attained and performed. Hence, it was recommended that
Malambuon Multi-Purpose Cooperative should offer livelihood and entrepreneurial
loans to its members to assist for them to have their capital, the cooperative must tap
the CHED for the livelihood and training for educational scholarship, and must
develop their online portal to be able to create development to the cooperative.

performance in the last seven years. In 2011 and 2012, the cooperative generated
high income from agricultural products and services such as sales and lend of cows,
hogs, chicken, feeds, palay, rice, corn, coconut, and banana. However, higher costs
in feeds and veterinary pulled down the results of operation that makes cooperative
suffered losses during the years. By the year 2015 and onwards, segment
expenditure was being driven upwards by higher travel and transportation costs of
cows, hogs, chicken, palay, rice, corn, coconut, banana to deliver in different places.
The second business of the cooperative is the Consumer Store. Table 2 shows the

Cooperative. Students also save their money for the reason of buying cellphones for
their graduation.

By the year 2013 to 2015, the decreasing trends are due to an increase in
withdrawals of directors and other officers due to financial needs. Mostly, they
withdraw their savings when it reaches the amount of 10,000 and above. By the
following years, directors and officers withdraw an ample amount for the same
reason, but in return, they set aside their honorarium for their savings that make it
increase. According to the manager, when an officer is to celebrate his birthday,
other officers will share 50.00 each to him as addition to his shares in the
cooperative. The share capital is deducted savings of 2% from the contribution of
officers.

The fourth business of the Cooperative is Loan Services. Loan services are
classified into two (2), the Business and Regular Loan. Table 4 shows the financial

management and the collector made an agreement of paying his liabilities monthly to
prevent from sending him to court.
In mid-2014 to 2015, the management decided to condone 100% penalties and
interest to collect and return the capital itself. During the year, the secretary and
treasurer already acted as the collector. The cooperative had accumulated the
collector an ample amount of his liability and is one of the reasons for decreasing
receivables during the year
On the year 2016, the Cooperative resume on releasing regular loan with
corresponding collaterals, and the reasons for increasing receivables during the

their obligations regularly due to their collaterals.

of the Cooperative, miscellaneous expense, and electricity. The cost incurred was
not that high that makes the cooperative to generate profit over time.

The latest business of the Coop is the Memorial Care Services. According to the
manager, upon membership they require all members to avail of this kind of services
for a purpose. The Coop insured member only when they die, but they never provide
insurance to members upon membership because if the Cooperative guarantees
them, they will always have an insurance payment to the members and it will be an

additional expense to the cooperative. If a member/borrower died, first, the

cooperative offset his account automatically and then if he is covered to the
memorial program, he will receive 60,000 benefits that are used for the nine days
of vigil, and if there is remaining money, the Coop will give it to the heirs. The
member that availed this service should pay P250.00 every month until they reach
the maximum payment of P30,000 allocated for the memorial insurance and is
payable for 5-10 years. According to the manager, only 30% of the members availed
this service because most of them had already availed to other insurance company.
The main contributor of coop income was from the sales or lend of hogs, cows,
chicken, feeds, palay, rice, corn, coconut, banana in Agri-Production and for the lot
contribution in the Coop Village. The primary driver of cost was coming from high
honorarium being paid to the directors down to the employees and the feeds and

veterinary that was used for pig feeding and raising.

Case Overview

Extensive Plywood Manufacturers Corporation (EMCO) of Magallanes
is engaged in manufacture and distribution of plywood for both domestic and
international markets. They have 300 factory workers and 6 office employees.
Their office employees received a minimum wage while workers received their
wage depending on how many finish product they would produce per day. The
company produces 2,000 panels per day, each panel has 300 sheets of
plywood. To have a production, the company needs raw materials to process
into finish products. The raw materials can be purchased either from local or

foreign suppliers.

EMCO Magallanes order raw materials twice a week for 4-5 ten wheeler
of logs and that order can be delivered 1-2 weeks after the deal. The manager
added that this order will be processed first into finished products for about two

weeks or three before reordering.

The manager does not review the inventory records when ordering of
raw materials. She only relies on the verbal report of the warehousemen. When
reordering, the warehousemen will report first to the manager that all of the
materials were processed into finish products or nothing is left in the
warehouse. In this case, the operation will stop for one or two weeks during the
waiting time of the supplies except for the maintenance department and office
employees for paper works. There is also a time that there is log ban,

he company cannot order raw materials. By then, the operation of the company
vill stop for more than a week when there are no supplies and wait for the

delivery to be back.

In 26 years of service, EMCO Magallanes had been practicing reordering
of stocks when the raw material is at its zero level or nothing is left. The
manager said that the unavailability of raw materials in the warehouse causes
their operation to stop which also affects the workers of the company. According
to the manager, since this problem is not new to them and they are already
used to it especially the workers, all they can do is to wait until when the raw

materials shall be delivered to start the operation again.

The company does not practice the lead time for ordering raw materials.
Any time that the raw materials stored in the warehouse are consumed that is
the time the manager will process the order. The manager said that the previous
management practicing this one, so she followed what had been done for the

previous years.

Any time that the raw materials stored in the warehouse are consumed that is

To process the order, the company needs to have a purchase order
request and this is done by the accounting in-charge in EMCO of Magallanes
and will be approved by the manager. Once it is approved, it will be sent to the
main office. The main office will process the orders through phone calls or send
emails to suppliers. Then they will canvass for raw materials price and
availability. Once the supplier confirms the stock availability and price, delivery

will follow.

Once the ordered material was delivered to EMCO Magallanes, the
personnel in-charge makes an actual count of the materials delivered by the
supplier through scaling and compares the purchase order and delivery order
receipts if they match then the company will sign. When mismatched happens,
personnel in-charge will call the supplier to inform that the order is lacking.
Then, the personnel in-charge will hand over the delivery order to the
accounting in-charge to be introduced to inventory department. After

introducing to inventory department, recording of stocks followed then
production will start. Inventory counting is done every end of the week for the

raw materials and for finish products.

Recording of stocks is done when EMCO received the supplies from the
supplier. The personnel in-charge records the number of raw materials used
per day as well as the number of the finished product. Recording of product
sold is done every end of the week with the use of their receipt on hand. She
added that, with regards to receipt walk-in customers, they are not consistently
given official receipts since some of it bought for a little amount and others are

in hurry.

EMCO Magallanes do the physical counting of raw materials and
finished products. The person-in-charge will compare their inventory counts to
inventory recorded in their inventory software. As stated by the personnel in-
charge, so far there are no big numbers of discrepancies in physical counting
and in the inventory records of raw materials. It is just the products that have
been sold without official receipts that create the discrepancies in records as

they are tracing the discrepancies.

The practices of EMCO Magallanes in inventory controlling of raw
materials and the finished product is done in many ways. EMCO Magallanes
uses the stock card as identification of the number of the finished product only.
When the finished products are out in the warehouse, it will be checked

first by the warehousemen if the actual inventory with the documents will match.
Then the number of products sold will be automatically deducted in the stock
card. For raw materials, warehousemen do not keep on monitoring the
remaining logs. Cycle counting for materials is not also implemented. He said
that, as long as the production is going on, he just monitors when it is all
consumed to place another order because the important thing for them is that

raw materials are all produced into finish product.

According to the personnel in charge, the manager does not usually
check the inventory records. She just asks the in charge about the available
raw materials. The person in-charge also added that the manager does not feel
alarming every time the operation stops because they are used to it and the
manager’s reason is that they cannot demand the supplier to deliver raw

materials immediately or as soon as possible because of log ban.

If the company operates 30 days a month, they will produce 60,000
panels. The figure below shows the actual percentage of production and sales

mean of (2.08) with a verbal description of the fair which means it only slightly
influenced customers to avail the offered service, hence, less effective. On the
other hand, Flier got the overall weighted mean of (1.75), and the Facebook

were ineffective in influencing customers to avail the offered service of the
company based on the Likert-Scale Model Interpretation. Herein, the
management fails to manage consistently its advertising media especially its
facebook page which has a higher possibility of reaching a large number of
potential customers. Furthermore, the number of fliers and tarpaulins produced
were not enough in raising awareness of the existence of the business. Hence,
there is a need for the company to change the way it advertised the

existing media to influence and induced actions from a large number of

business was affected by calamities. According to the general manager, they
had a hard time in purchasing products in Butuan City after the calamities that

happened. They also have a difficulty of monitoring the remaining products on

the shelves during the time of calamities, because their focus shifted on the

current situation which is the demand of products especially the basic

commodities was high and it leads to the shortage of stocks for the reason that

they cannot immediately purchase this product from their suppliers.

By year 2016, Travies General Merchandise practices are the same
and these practices are forecasting ahead of time was not practiced, regular
auditing such as physical inventory, spot checking and cycle counting was
sometimes practice. Buying new products depends on the general managers
wants but the difference is they purchased new varieties of products and
increased the volumes of these products as part of the strategy of the general
manager to attract customers and decrease the volume of the commonly
purchased products. The inventory level increases according to the general
manager. However, there was a direct loss of potential sales when consumers
tend to buy products they usually ran out-of-stock that leadsconsumers to
purchase items at another store or do not purchase at all. On the same year,
the general manager stated that only few of their customers bought and
ordered wholesale products from them, considering the unavailability of the
products and also running out-of-stock. The numbers of customers placing
orders at Travies General Merchandise were decreasing as can be seen on
figure 3. The general manager noticed some items were missing and damaged
that he considered it as loss. This situation affects the business that decrease
in their sales.

According to the general manager, forecasting demand of products
ir current situation and the changing preferences of the

depend on thei

customers. However, they only forecast the indemand products when

problems arise. Travies General Merchandise considered many factors in

planning for purchases such as what to order, when to order and how much to

order relative to the demand of costumer especially since they purchase twice
a month.

As to planning what to order, the general manager will list down the
items that are not available on the Shelves. Travies General Merchandise
purchased products from their suppliers in bulk to get price discounts and far
them to meet the unexpected demands of the customers. Even though Travies
General Merchandise purchased products in bulk still the demands of
customers are still unpredictable that he never can predict when the demand
will increase, According to the general manager, their basis on planning when
to order the product is through visual checking the remaining products on the
shelves, and when he observe that there is only 10% from the overall number
of stocks of each remaining productdisplayed on the shelves, they will list the
items to be ordered to their suppliers through phone call.

He added that every two to three times a month, the business
experiences a shortage of the fast-moving product which leads them to
purchase additional products from their competitors and re-sell it with no
mark-up on prices, so that their customers will still buy goods from them
especially on customers who purchase on a wholesale basis. According to the
general manager, he spends unnecessary amounts of money on items such
as new varieties of products just to attract the customers regardless if it is
saleable or not. The number and the volume of products to be ordered depend
on the demand of the customer and the remaining number of products in the

shelves. However, the availability of cash on hand per month can also be one

of their basis in determining how many to order

According to the general manager planning is only conducted whenever
he likes to plan or when the general manager is in the mood in planning, also
when he had available time to plan. He added that planning is exercised when
if it is needed. |

The general manager controls the orders through listing the products to
be purchased. The quantities of those products to be purchased are based on
the ordered list and the remaining product on the shelves. Also, the quantities
of products to be purchased depend on the demand of the customer. When the
customer buys a product that are already out of stock, the general manager
will buy in bulk of that product for the next order in order to fill the needs of the
customers and to acquire price discounts from their suppliers. Shortage of
goods has been experienced when the products purchased from the supplier
are not available.

Ordering is done twice a month from their suppliers. The general

manager will base the order on what is on the list that was made prior to the

ordering date. When ordering these products, the owner calls the suppliers

about the goods to be ordered which is then picked up on the following day by

the driver and laborer. The payment for the order will be in the form of check

and will be carried by the person assigned to pick up the goods purchased.

Receiving of stocks is performed by checking the list of the orders.
During the arrival of the ordered products, the general manager assigns a

person to do the counting with him. The General Manager makes sure that the

products available is done Prior to the purchasing period. Travies General
Merchandise also has no regular basis on auditing for those products
purchased and sold and according to the general manager they have poor
communication within both the employee during the controlling operation of
products because of his busy time and the availability of the employee to
execute the operation.

According to the general manager, the inventory is done at the end of

that their accounts will become delinquent for the reason that their capacity to
pay is proven and they are trusted by the cooperative. The borrower becomes
Class A when he/she avails three (3) consecutive loans without delayed
payments. However, Class B borrowers have possibilities that their accounts
will become delinquent for the reason that when the account officer/credit
investigator collect their monthly amortization they was not able to pay
because they need their money to buy some of their needs. Thus, they ask an
extension of their payments. Class C borrowers are those who avail
credit/loans for the first time, since their character as a borrower are not yet
validated by the cooperative. And in most cases, Class C borrower has the
most delinquent accounts. Class A, B and C borrower are composed of

According to the loan clerk the borrowers of Commercial Loan are
Class C members who had small businesses. They can avail the loan as long
as they have the capacity to pay and their income is stable. These are the
reasons that the members were not able to pay his/her obligation due to
fortuitous event like failure of business operation, family emergencies,
financial problems, and the borrowers character who name the capacity to
pay but the willingness to pay is absent.

policies needed to be implemented and followed in order to successfully

"THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COLLECTION POLICY OF PERA
MULTI-PURPOSE COOPERATIVE BUTUAN BRANCH
","CASE ABSTRACT

Pera Multi-Purpose Cooperative Butuan Branch has been experiencing an
increase in the delinquent amount of SSS pension loans from the year 2015
to 2017. The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the collection policy
and to the alteration of non-value adding procedures. The specific areas of
the study are the grace period, payment alternative, monitoring, and follow-up
and litigation. The researchers of this study used descriptive method for the
evaluation of this case. The study used the purposive-complete enumeration
sampling method, Frequency Distribution Table in summary and presentation
of data and weighted mean together with the qualitative description in the
evaluation of the procedures. The given grace period had an average
weighted mean of 2.40 with a verbal description of Less Effective. Payment
alternative had an average weighted mean of 2.52 with a verbal description of
Effective. Monitoring and follow-ups with an average weighted mean of 2.80
with a verbal description of Effective. And litigation had an average weighted
mean of 2.28 with a verbal description of Less Effective. The researchers
found out that the current collection policy of Pera MPC in the delinquent
account is less effective. The researchers recommended that the cooperative
must give a grace period of up to 15 days only. Second, the cooperative must
apply litigation consistently against the delinquent borrowers in accordance
with the time frame designated in taking legal action to make the sending of
2™4 and final demand letter effective. Third, the cooperative must take into
reality the use of co-makers. Fourth, the cooperative must accept pledges
from delinquent borrower specifically those pledges that carry value for sale.
Fifth, the cooperative must offer a savings account. Lastly, the cooperative
must create a system that will automatically send a text message about the
status of the borrower’s obligation

non-members of the cooperative. The cooperative offers SSS and GSIS
pension loan which is Payable within three (3) years and capitalization which
is payable in twelve (12) months. There are two (2) kinds of SSS: retirement
pension loan and Survivorship pension loan. Retirement pension loan is those
retirees who want to apply for a pension loan while survivorship is those
widower or widow of the late retirees and now a pensioner who wish to apply
for a loan. The borrowers are those members and non-members of the
cooperative intended for the cooperative to grow. The assumptions of letting it
out to non-member applicant, it is guaranteed that they would receive a
monthly pension as long as the borrower is alive and no changes in their
marital status that can trigger to stop its monthly pension. As of now, the
cooperative is still accepting new non-member borrower of SSS and GSIS
pension loan.

The borrower can apply for a minimum loan of one thousand (1,000)
pesos regardless of retirement or survivorship and a maximum of one million
(1,000,000) pesos with an interest rate of 2% per month.

Table 1 showed the maximum loanable amount for both retirement and
survivorship. The data shows that when a borrower becomes older, the
loanable amount will become lesser for both types of the borrower as well as
the maximum term to pay the loan.

According to the Officer-in-charge, at the time of credit application, the
loan processor will be the one to conduct a ""KYC"" or know your customer. It
includes asking of personal information of the applicant as well as the kind of
SSS pension he/she has: retirement or survivorship. Submission of
requirements shall follow after the interview and the computation of the net
amount to be released. The branch would then call the head office for
verification of SSS pension. Afterward, the filling out of the credit application
form of the applicant together with his/her co-maker. If the principal amount is
below fifty thousand (50,000) the cooperative Butuan branch is allowed to
approve the loan. But if above fifty thousand (50,000) the cooperative Butuan
branch would call the head office for loan approval.

From loan processor it is being checked by the bookkeeper, pass to
the in charge of the office for approval and lastly to the cashier for cash
disbursement.

Cash disbursement is done within the day of credit application. The
amount disbursed is deducted by the total amount of interest rates for one
year and other charges that include the insurance. The insurance of the

cooperative has contestability. A borrower must reach the 1-year

contestability of the cooperative's coverage from the date of approval to have
the whole amount of the obligation paid by the insurer. But if the borrower
died before it reaches the 1-year contestability, the insurer would only pay the
outstanding amount of the obligation.
The loan requirements for both retirement and survivorship pension loan are
as follows:

e ATM card with PIN

e SSSID

e Bank statement of account at least six months

e SSS verification

e Co-maker with valid |.D

The loan processor will also inform the borrower in times of credit

application that it is forbidden to enter into a live-in relationship and to declare
a loss of ATM card to their designated bank to avoid the delinquency of
account that leads in taking legal action. She would also remind the borrower
that the SSS pension is subject for annual renewal. The rationale for this is to

make the SSS pension updated. Moreover, this is a mandatory policy of the

SSS office to its SSS pensioner.

Table 2 showed the money disbursement from the year 2015 to 2017
of SSS pension loan which is the net of discount. The management provided
the data. It indicates that the collection for the year 2015 to 2016 exceeds the
amount released during the year. However, in the year 2017, the amount
collected is lesser than the amount released. According to the officer-in-
charge, even the collection exceeds the amount released during the year yet,
the total outstanding loan which consists of cash releases for the year and the
loan receivable from the previous year is higher than the collected amount
during the year. He also added that as the number of borrowers increases the
risk of having a delinquent borrower also increases, that affects the amount

that is supposed to be collected.

this case, the circumstances of having higher delinquent amount also
increases through the following reasons. First, other survivor borrowers re-
marries or enters into a ""live-in"" relationship that pushed the SSS pension to
be cut off as what the SSS policy mandated. Second, is that other borrowers
declare a loss of ATM card to their designated bank. Thus, the bank would
issue them another ATM Card without the knowledge of the cooperative,
leaving their obligation unpaid.

Lastly, those borrowers who have a delinquent account that pays cash
directly to the cooperative’s office monthly and suddenly failed to continue the
monthly amortization have the following reason: the borrower's experienced
financial difficulties such as bankruptcy of small business, borrowers who
depend on someone else income such as their children with low salary or lose
a job. Future contingencies like the death of a family member and sickness.
Unwillingness to pay like laziness or transfer of location of the borrower that
made their account delinquent.

According to the in-charge of the office, once the borrowers failed to
pay their monthly obligation the cooperative would now give thirty (30) days
as grace period from the date the borrower was unable to pay the monthly
obligation, after the grace period the cooperative would now consider the
account as delinquent. According to the in charge office, they made the range
of grace period the same as the range of monthly amortization which is thirty
(30) days to help the borrower generate cash flow and be able to surely pays

their obligation before charging a 2% penalty fee. Nevertheless, some of them

Table 4 showed the aging of the loan receivable from the year 2015 to
2017. It shows that the current amount for the year is lesser than the total
delinquent amount during the year. The in-charge of the office said that after
sending each demand letter to the borrower every thirty (30) days, the

cooperative would not undertake any action and wait for the borrower to visit

the cooperative's office and pay the obligation.

The cashier of Pera MPC would withdraw the monthly pension of the

borrower at their designated bank on the date indicated in the bank statement

provided by the borrower during the application of loan and automatically

monthly amortization would then get the amount at the Pera MPC office.
There are instances that upon inserting the ATM card notifications would
appear that the ATM card is blocked or closed.

According to the in charge of the office, sometimes they failed to
withdraw the monthly pension of the borrower due to ATM is blocked or
closed or the SSS cuts off the monthly pension of the survivorship pension
loan borrower. In this case, the cooperative shall call the borrower within the
day, or they would visit the borrower's residence to let the borrower explain
the reason of why the ATM card cannot be accessed. And discuss the
appropriate period to pay the account before the cooperative considers the
account delinquent and impose a 2 % penalty fee. The cooperative would
remind the borrower about the obligation every fifteen (15) and thirty (30) days
in the grace period. Whatever the circumstances the cooperative would not
extend the length of grace period given to the borrower.

When other circumstances occur like the SSS pension reached its limit
for one year, and thus it needs to be renewed, the SSS office is the one who
is responsible for making the SSS pension up-to-date. The SSS office will
send a letter to the pensioner, stating that the latter must renew or update
their SSS pension at the SSS office to avoid its expiration. In this case, the

cooperative would only call the borrower to remind the latter that the SSS

pension reached its term and must be renewed.

be the one to deliver the letter at the borrower's residence to remind the
borrower that the account was already delinquent and it needs to be paid.

According to the in charge of the office, when the account becomes
delinquent. The branch gives one (1) week to the borrower before sending the
balance of a statement to the head office. He added that the head office
sometimes is occupied with multiple schedules that lead to a delayed in
sending demand letters.

After thirty (30) days from the day where the first collection letter was
sent if the account is still unpaid, the branch would send a new balance of a
statement to the head office. On the following day, the head office will then
send a second collection letter to the borrower delivered again by the head
office’s collector.

According to the in charge of the office, after thirty (30) days from the
day the first collection letter was sent, second collection letter must be sent to
the delinquent borrower if the account is still unpaid. But before that, the same
practiced are done it takes one (1) week before the branch sends another
balance of each delinquent account to the head office. After the head office
received the balance, it takes another five (5) to seven (7) days before the
head office sends the second collection letter to the borrower.

When the account is still unpaid, and it becomes sixty-five (65) days

delinquent, the branch would then send another balance to the head office

after thirty (30) days from the day second collection letter was sent. The head

branch sends the balance and the head office's collector would deliver this.
According to the in charge of the office, after thirty (30) days from the
day, the second collection letter was sent if there is no payment made a third
collection letter must be sent. The same practiced was done by the
cooperative Butuan branch before sending the third collection letter. It takes
one (1) week before sending the balance to the head office and another five
(5) to seven (7) days before the third collection letter would be addressed.
Subsequently, if the accounts are still unpaid, the first demand letter
would be sent. Followed by second and final demand letter, the same practice
is done in sending demand letters. The cooperative's lawyer must sign the
letter. According to the in charge of the office, sometimes the cooperative's
attormey was not around due to a busy schedule that makes the sending of
collection letters took five (5) days to one (1) week from the day the head
office receives the balance.
lf the latter remained silent after sending all collection and demand
letters the account must be subject to legal action as what the standard
procedures of collecting payment on a delinquent account stated. According
to the in charge of the office, they do not apply litigation automatically.
After three demand letters if still, no payment made he would visit the
borrower’s residence thirty (30) days after the final demand was sent. Or If the
borrower goes to the Butuan Branch’s office after the last demand letter, they

would undertake amicable settlement in the office. They would have a verbal

minimal amount the cooperative would restructure the account to stop the
penalty and continue paying the total amount. If again the borrower who has a
restructured account failed to execute a monthly payment, they would again
inform the head office that the account is delinquent. But before that, the
same practice was done they give thirty (30) days grace period before
imposing a 2% penalty fee. The head office would be the one to send a

letters were sent and payment is not made, the cooperative would now

improved in size while at night time this emphasized by installing light fixtures
to be visible. As for Spatial Layout, provide a kitchen cabinet, change the
boundary wall into a sliding door and window while the Ambiance, install an Air
Conditioner, add light bulb inside the kitchenette that has a maximum wattage,
change the wall paint that was already faded, add decoration that is classy and
is in line with the new trend. Lastly, for functionality, remake the menu list, clean
the fans regularly, remodel the main door, and change the torn out part of the
ceiling outside kitchenette. Thus, the outcome of the study reveals significant

CASE ABSTRACT

The researchers conducted a study entitled Customer Service
Evaluation of Priscilla City Guest House in South Montilla Boulevard Brgy.
J.P.Rizal, Butuan City. Purposive-Convenience Sampling Method was used
for gathering data. A modified survey questionnaire was developed and a
frequency distribution table was used for the weighted mean and used a Likert
Scale to analyze data. The study was conducted from August 2018 up to

November 2018.

The result of the evaluation showed that in the area of Communication
it generated the average weighted mean of 3.48. In relation to that, Priscilla
City Guest House lacks proper communication that many of its guests are
having negative feedbacks to it. In the area of Assurance, it emphasizes that
somehow the orders must be acknowledged immediately as well as its waiting
time. In the area of Tangibles, restaurant facility is at par but lacking of proper
condiments are the main concern of many of their guest. In the area of
Empathy, being responsive and attentive are somewhat Priscilla City Guest
House service crew falls short on it. Lastly, the area which generated the
lowest average weighted mean is Timeliness, 3.35. Considerably in delivering
good customer service and satisfaction, the business establishment must
practice on being timely especially when the nature of its business is food
service. Priscilla City Guest House guests arguably denote their capacity on
delivering food orders on time.
","Case Overview

From the management perspective, they just let their guests find their
seats since most of the time, the service crew only stayed at the front desk
section of the restaurant. When a guest calls for their order, the service crew
would then proceed to the occupied table of the guests and attentively take
their orders. The service crew would write down the order in his/her note pad
and after then this is repeated twice for order confirmation. Then the service
crew shall inform the guest to wait for 10-15 minutes for the order preparation.
Also they shall ask the guest for any additional order. If none, the orders slip

shall then be forwarded to the kitchen and received by the assistant cook. The

BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION 2019
i> ACLC College of Butuan Cit °

HDS Building, 999 J.C. Aquino Avenue, Butuan City

assistant cook would then give the said orders to the head cook for
preparation and cooking. However, if the orders were in bulk, the orders which
follow would be pended in order to serve the first one. So in preparing the
orders, the head cook and its assistant follows the “first come, first serve
basis"". However when the service crew fails to deliver the orders accordingly,

these are the cases somewhat the food orders are being interchanged from

other guests.

During peak hours, it takes more than fifteen (15) minutes to deliver the
order of the guests. If there are lots of pending orders, the availability of the
ingredients will not be monitored by the head cook and its assistant. With
these circumstances the unavailability of the food menu will not be instantly
relayed to the service crew. The management would then rush to the nearest
department store and market to supply the lacking ingredients. In addition the

kitchen does not have an ingredients list to monitor it.

After the order is done the service crew will deliver it to the guest's
table. Hand it over carefully, the service crew will then will ask for any request
or additional orders. After the food delivery is done, the service crew will
return to the kitchen area and check for some pending orders. Upon the time
when the guest is finished on dining, they will call the service crew for a bill
out. But there were instances where the service crew cannot immediately
respond to them due to a busy dining area. The service crew will then hand
over the bill and waits for the guest to give the payment, after receiving the

payment the service crew will forward it to the cashier for confirmation and

change of bill.

But some instances arise where the service crew would take around
five (5), to ten (10) minutes before returning the change to the guests’ table,
as soon as the guests receive its change and receipt from their payment, the
guests then walk out through the dining area. After that the service crew will
clean the table and arranged the seat, also they will inspect for any left
belongings. After that, the service crew will forward the bussed plates to the
kitchen area for washing, then returns to the dining area. However, when the

dining area is busy the service crew cannot accommodate all incoming guest.

The Priscilla City Guest House Restaurant has fifteen (1 5) dining tables, four
(4) of these are round tables that measures thirty-five (35) inches in
circumference and the eleven (11) are square dining tables that measure
thirty (30 x 30) inches. The dining area measures thirty-five (35) square meter
and has six (6) service doors that serve as the entrance and exit passage of
the establishment. The dining area holds approximately fifty-five (55) person
in full capacity, however the dining tables lack proper condiments like soy

sauce, vinegar and seasoning.

CASE ABSTRACT

Pera Multi-Purpose Cooperative Butuan Branch has been experiencing an
increase in the delinquent amount of SSS pension loans from the year 2015
to 2017. The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the collection policy
and to the alteration of non-value adding procedures. The specific areas of
the study are the grace period, payment alternative, monitoring, and follow-up
and litigation. The researchers of this study used descriptive method for the
evaluation of this case. The study used the purposive-complete enumeration
sampling method, Frequency Distribution Table in summary and presentation
of data and weighted mean together with the qualitative description in the
evaluation of the procedures. The given grace period had an average
weighted mean of 2.40 with a verbal description of Less Effective. Payment
alternative had an average weighted mean of 2.52 with a verbal description of
Effective. Monitoring and follow-ups with an average weighted mean of 2.80
with a verbal description of Effective. And litigation had an average weighted
mean of 2.28 with a verbal description of Less Effective. The researchers
found out that the current collection policy of Pera MPC in the delinquent
account is less effective. The researchers recommended that the cooperative
must give a grace period of up to 15 days only. Second, the cooperative must
apply litigation consistently against the delinquent borrowers in accordance
with the time frame designated in taking legal action to make the sending of
2™ and final demand letter effective. Third, the cooperative must take into
reality the use of co-makers. Fourth, the cooperative must accept pledges
from delinquent borrower specifically those pledges that carry value for sale.
Fifth, the cooperative must offer a savings account. Lastly, the cooperative
must create a system that will automatically send a text message about the
status of the borrower's obligation
","Case Overview

Pera Multipurpose Cooperative Butuan branch presently has four

hundred eighteen (418), active borrowers. Majority of the borrowers are the
d _ ACLC College of Butuan City

4

non-members of the cooperative. The cooperative offers SSS and GSIS
pension loan which is payable within three (3) years and capitalization which
is payable in twelve (12) months. There are two (2) kinds of SSS: retirement
pension loan and survivorship pension loan. Retirement pension loan is those
retirees who want to apply for a pension loan while survivorship is those
widower or widow of the late retirees and now a pensioner who wish to apply
for a loan. The borrowers are those members and non-members of the
cooperative intended for the cooperative to grow. The assumptions of letting it
out to non-member applicant, it is guaranteed that they would receive a
monthly pension as long as the borrower is alive and no changes in their
marital status that can trigger to stop its monthly pension. As of now, the
cooperative is still accepting new non-member borrower of SSS and GSIS
pension loan.

The borrower can apply for a minimum loan of one thousand (1,000)
pesos regardless of retirement or survivorship and a maximum of one million
(1,000,000) pesos with an interest rate of 2% per month.

Table 1 showed the maximum loanable amount for both retirement and
survivorship. The data shows that when a borrower becomes older, the
loanable amount will become lesser for both types of the borrower as well as
the maximum term to pay the loan.

According to the officer-in-charge, at the time of credit application, the
loan processor will be the one to conduct a ""KYC"" or know your customer. It
includes asking of personal information of the applicant as well as the kind of
SSS pension he/she has: retirement or survivorship. Submission of

requirements shall follow after the interview and the computation of the net
amount to be released. The branch would then call the head office for
verification of SSS pension. Afterward, the filling out of the credit application
form of the applicant together with his/her co-maker. If the principal amount is
below fifty thousand (50,000) the cooperative Butuan branch is allowed to
approve the loan. But if above fifty thousand (50,000) the cooperative Butuan
branch would call the head office for loan approval.
From loan processor it is being checked by the bookkeeper, pass to
the in charge of the office for approval and lastly to the cashier for cash

disbursement.

Cash disbursement is done within the day of credit application. The
amount disbursed is deducted by the total amount of interest rates for one
year and other charges that include the insurance. The insurance of the
cooperative has contestability. A borrower must reach the 1-year

contestability of the cooperative's coverage from the date of approval to have
the whole amount of the obligation paid by the insurer. But if the borrower

died before it reaches the 1-year contestability, the insurer would only pay the

outstanding amount of the obligation.

The loan requirements for both retirement and survivorship pension loan are

as follows:

e ATM card with PIN

e SSSI.D

e Bank statement of account at least six months

e SSS verification

e Co-maker with valid |.D

The loan processor will also inform the borrower in times of credit

application that it is forbidden to enter into a live-in relationship and to declare
a loss of ATM card to their designated bank to avoid the delinquency of
account that leads in taking legal action. She would also remind the borrower
that the SSS pension is subject for annual renewal. The rationale for this is to
make the SSS pension updated. Moreover, this is a mandatory policy of the
SSS office to its SSS pensioner.

the data. It indicates that the collection for the year 2015 to 2016 exceeds the
amount released during the year. However, in the year 2017, the amount
collected is lesser than the amount released. According to the officer-in-
charge, even the collection exceeds the amount released during the year yet,
the total outstanding loan which consists of cash releases for the year and the
loan receivable from the previous year is higher than the collected amount
during the year. He also added that as the number of borrowers increases the
risk of having a delinquent borrower also increases, that affects the amount
that is supposed to be collected.

According to the officer-in-charge, the increasing number of borrowers also

corresponds to the increase in loan receivable for the year. He added that in

this case, the circumstances of having higher delinquent amount also
increases through the following reasons. First, other survivor borrowers re-
marries or enters into a ""live-in"" relationship that pushed the SSS pension to
be cut off as what the SSS policy mandated. Second, is that other borrowers
declare a loss of ATM card to their designated bank. Thus, the bank would
issue them another ATM Card without the knowledge of the cooperative,
leaving their obligation unpaid.

Lastly, those borrowers who have a delinquent account that pays cash
directly to the cooperative’s office monthly and suddenly failed to continue the
monthly amortization have the following reason: the borrower's experienced
financial difficulties such as bankruptcy of small business, borrowers who
depend on someone else income such as their children with low salary or lose
a job. Future contingencies like the death of a family member and sickness.
Unwillingness to pay like laziness or transfer of location of the borrower that
made their account delinquent.

According to the in-charge of the office, once the borrowers failed to
pay their monthly obligation the cooperative would now give thirty (30) days
as grace period from the date the borrower was unable to pay the monthly
obligation, after the grace period the cooperative would now consider the
account as delinquent. According to the in charge office, they made the range
of grace period the same as the range of monthly amortization which is thirty
(30) days to help the borrower generate cash flow and be able to surely pays
their obligation before charging a 2% penalty fee. Nevertheless, some of them

Table 4 showed the aging of the loan receivable from the year 2015 to

2017. It shows that the current amount for the year is lesser than the total
delinquent ammount during the year. The in-charge of the office said that after
sending each demand letter to the borrower every thirty (30) days, the
cooperative would not undertake any action and wait for the borrower to visit
the cooperative's office and pay the obligation.

The cashier of Pera MPC would withdraw the monthly pension of the
borrower at their designated bank on the date indicated in the bank statement
provided by the borrower during the application of loan and automatically
deduct the monthly allocated amount of the loan. The borrower with a

remaining amount of monthly pension after deduction of the amount of

monthly amortization would then get the amount at the Pera MPC office.

There are instances that upon inserting the ATM card notifications would

appear that the ATM card is blocked or closed.

According to the in charge of the office, sometimes they failed to
withdraw the monthly pension of the borrower due to ATM is blocked or
closed or the SSS cuts off the monthly pension of the survivorship pension
loan borrower. In this case, the cooperative shall call the borrower within the
day, or they would visit the borrowers residence to let the borrower explain
the reason of why the ATM card cannot be accessed. And discuss the
appropriate period to pay the account before the cooperative considers the
account delinquent and impose a 2 % penalty fee. The cooperative would
remind the borrower about the obligation every fifteen (15) and thirty (30) days
in the grace period. Whatever the circumstances the cooperative would not
extend the length of grace period given to the borrower.

When other circumstances occur like the SSS pension reached its limit
for one year, and thus it needs to be renewed, the SSS office is the one who
is responsible for making the SSS pension up-to-date. The SSS office will
send a letter to the pensioner, stating that the latter must renew or update
their SSS pension at the SSS office to avoid its expiration. In this case, the
cooperative would only call the borrower to remind the latter that the Sss

pension reached its term and must be renewed.
The cooperative accepts payment alternative aside from ATM-like post-

dated check over the counter payment, field collection if requested and

be the one to deliver the letter at the borrowers residence to remind the
borrower that the account was already delinquent and it needs to be paid.

According to the in charge of the office, when the account becomes
delinquent. The branch gives one (1) week to the borrower before sending the
balance of a statement to the head office. He added that the head office
sometimes is occupied with multiple schedules that lead to a delayed in
sending demand letters.

After thirty (30) days from the day where the first collection letter was
sent if the account is still unpaid, the branch would send a new balance of a
Statement to the head office. On the following day, the head office will then
send a second collection letter to the borrower delivered again by the head
office’s collector.

According to the in charge of the office, after thirty (30) days from the
day the first collection letter was sent, second collection letter must be sent to
the delinquent borrower if the account is still unpaid. But before that, the same
practiced are done it takes one (1) week before the branch sends another
balance of each delinquent account to the head office. After the head office
received the balance, it takes another five (5) to seven (7) days before the
head office sends the second collection letter to the borrower.

When the account is still unpaid, and it becomes sixty-five (65) days
delinquent, the branch would then send another balance to the head office

after thirty (30) days from the day second collection letter was sent. The head

office will send a third collection letter the day after the cooperative Butuan
branch sends the balance and the head office's collector would deliver this.

According to the in charge of the office, after thirty (30) days from the
day, the second collection letter was sent if there is no payment made a third
collection letter must be sent. The same practiced was done by the
cooperative Butuan branch before sending the third collection letter. It takes
one (1) week before sending the balance to the head office and another five
(5) to seven (7) days before the third collection letter would be addressed.

Subsequently, if the accounts are still unpaid, the first demand letter
would be sent. Followed by second and final demand letter, the same practice
is done in sending demand letters. The cooperative's lawyer must sign the
letter. According to the in charge of the office, sometimes the cooperative's
attorney was not around due to a busy schedule that makes the sending of
collection letters took five (5) days to one (1) week from the day the head
office receives the balance.

If the latter remained silent after sending all collection and demand
letters the account must be subject to legal action as what the standard
procedures of collecting payment on a delinquent account stated. According
to the in charge of the office, they do not apply litigation automatically.

After three demand letters if still, no payment made he would visit the
borrower's residence thirty (30) days after the final demand was sent. Or If the
borrower goes to the Butuan Branch’s office after the last demand letter, they

would undertake amicable settlement in the office. They would have a verbal

follow-up and listen to the reasons for the borrower with regards to the
delinquent account. If the borrower wants to settle his/her account at the
minimal amount the cooperative would restructure the account to stop the
penalty and continue paying the total amount. If again the borrower who has a
restructured account failed to execute a monthly payment, they would again
inform the head office that the account is delinquent. But before that, the
same practice was done they give thirty (80) days grace period before
imposing a 2% penalty fee. The head office would be the one to send a
collection and demand letter. After another three (3) collection and demand
letters were sent and payment is not made, the cooperative would now

undergo litigation.

"EVALUATION ON CREDIT AND COLLECTION PRACTICES OF.
FUNDLINE FINANCE CORPORATION BUTUAN BRANCH __
","hits, ACLC College of Butuan City

hes ""999 HDS Building, J.C. Aquino Avenue, Butuan City

CASE ABSTRACT

The Evaluation of Credit and Collection Practices of Fundline Finance
Corporation Butuan City Branch was assessed. The study aimed to evaluate
credit and collection practices based on a credit application, credit
investigation, credit approval, credit terms, and collection policy. While the
Study used the descriptive method and purposive-complete enumeration. A
total of nine (9) respondents were subjected.

Moreover, a four-point Likert Scale was also used to interpret and
analyze the data gathered. Results showed that the highest average mean
3.06 with a verbal description of Often under the area of credit application. It
was followed by an average mean of 2.80 with a verbal description of Often
under collection policy area. An average mean of 2.71 with a verbal
description of Often under the credit approval area was on the third line. The
second lowest average mean was 2.31 with a verbal description of
Sometimes under credit application area. The lowest mean was 1.64 with a
verbal description of Never under the domain of credit term. It indicates that
Fundline Finance Corporation was lenient in its implementation of credit and
collection policy.

Therefore, they need proper implementation following their manual so
that the company would not experience high delinquency accounts. The
researchers recommend that the corporation must have an appropriate
designation of work of the employees to separate the workplace of each
employee. Also, the corporation should hire more financial consultants to
become efficient in collecting everyday payment and delinquent accounts. In
rewards for early payment, the corporation should grant a discount to
customers who would pay on time or before the due date. For the late paying
customer, the corporation should charge penalties by canceling their credit
line and do not allow them to re-loan. Thus, evaluating credit and collection
practices is useful in a financial institution to increase the cash inflow of the
business.
","Case Overview

Fundline Finance Corporation was established to provide financing
services to its customers. They offer loan to finance existing businesses
regardless of the years of operation. If the customers want to avail the
services of the corporation, he/she will go directly to the office.

The loanable amount offers from 8,000 to ®250,000. For the loanable
amount below 10,000, the corporation does not require a co-maker while the
loanable amount 10,000 and above the corporation would require a co-
maker. There are two (2) types of their co-maker, the co-maker A is the
distant relative of the customer (e.g., third degree relatives) and the co-maker
B is anyone that the customer wants to be his/her co-maker except for his
spouse, as long as he/she has the capacity to pay.

In applying for the loan, the customer would fill up the forms for loan
application assisted by the secretary. The customer must also submit all
requirements and personal data like barangay permit or Mayor's license, BIR
permit, any valid 1.D, and 2x2 picture. The corporation would also discuss to
the customer when a customer is not able to pay his/her Obligation; the
corporation has the right get the home appliance indicated in the agreement
especially for those customers whose loanable amount is P10,000.00 and
above. The secretary reviewed the forms, documents, and requirements of
the customers if it is complete or not. Moreover, they also conduct a personal

interview with the customer because it can help them dig more information
about the customers’ background information and also it can build a
customer-employee relationship.

Once it is completed, the loan application form together with the
documents submitted would be forwarded to the financial consultant to take
action for a background investigation. The financial consultant will visit the
area of the business for inspection as a part of their loan investigation process
to ensure if it is existing and operational. If they can see that the customer
cannot pay they would not continue the loan application of the customer.
Moreover, if it is an old account, they would not conduct another investigation.
They believe that these customers are trustworthy and had already proved to
pay their obligation. It took three to five days in conducting credit investigation.

After the credit investigation, the financial consultant would submit the
credit investigation report to the officer-in-charge to evaluate further the
customers worthiness and also to give a commanding approval. The officer-
in-charge must have a careful evaluation of the customer if they are well worth
for providing financial support from the Fundline Finance Corporation. Also,
they do not require a credit reference in approving the loan since they only
focus on the necessary documents that the customer must submit. Once the
application is finalized and already approved by the officer-in-charge, it would
be sent to the central office through mailing for final approval. When the main
office agreed to the desired amount of the customer applied for, the secretary
would call the customer to inform that their loan was accepted and order them

to go to the office to talk personally and discuss the terms of credit. However,
if the central office would not approve the desired loanable amount of the
customer, they would lower the loanable amount and the secretary would
inform the customer about the loan applied. If the customer would agree the
approved amount, the cash custodian would immediately release the loan
checks.

The loan is payable within 100 days. The corporation deducted in
advance an interest of 16% per term upon releasing the loan. The loan would
be collected daily including Sunday.

The financial consultant would start the collection every day after the
loan was released. When a customer missed three (3) payment during the
term, a computerized system would automatically print out the name of the
customer and the first letter of notice. The first letter of notification contains
the name of the customer, address and the amount of the missed payment.
This is a friendly reminder to customers to repay their outstanding balances. If
the customer neglects the first letter of notice and there are no payments
received by the corporation, the second letter of advice would be sent to the
customer and also to the co-maker if there is a co-maker required upon the
application. It serves as a follow up reminder after issuing the first payment
reminder letter, and the tone should be direct than the first. It contains the
amount of the loan and the missed payments of the customer. If the
customers and the co-maker if applicable, still have no action taken with the
letter of second notice, the third letter would be generated by the corporation,

7
and it would be delivered by the Officer-in-charge personally. It contains the
amount of loan, the missed payment of the customer and the days that the
customers did not pay.

This letter would serve as a warning for the last chance of the customer
to settle his payments before the corporation would take legal action. If the
customer will not settle the obligation, the Attorney's letter would be sent to
the customer and legal action would be taken through a court settlement. The
Officer-In-Charge stated that they would no longer be prioritized to collect
default since it is just additional work for them and it would be better if they
focus on the new accounts only. Moreover, if the customer moves out from
their location without informing the corporation about their new current
addresses and if the customer experience a fortuitous event like sudden
death the corporation will not prioritize to have a settlement instead they focus
on collecting the new accounts.

Table 1 showed the amount of loan released with the total number of
customer. According to the Officer-in-charge, for the first three years (2013-
2015) they have ten areas with the total number of 1,515 customers. The
corporation had released the total amount of ?60,000,000 for the three (3)
years to help and finance the existing businesses. During this year the Officer-
in-charge also stated that some of the financial consultants did not remit the
money they collected. These result in the decision to lessen their areas during

the year 2016. Besides, for the year 2016-2017 the corporation has Only four

away when their account gets overdue. There are customers who declared
bankruptcy of their business and changed their location. In this situation, they
get the appliances stated in the agreement during the loan application. As
soon as the financial consultant took the appliances, they would sell it for the
customer to pay their debts and as an additional collection. Besides, financial
consultants maintain a healthy work relationship with the customers. In the
event, a customer is short on cash they would likely prioritize those
companies with whom the customer has a positive correlation does not have

a choice but to accept the reasons of some customers.

due date. While others are hiding to avoid paying their debts, the Corporation
would take legal action for the turnover of unpaid accounts to a collection

agency. It is their best option to use as their last resort. But before going to
this route, they would call the customers personally and make one final

appeal for payment. If the customers cannot pay, they would get the collateral

that was stated in the agreement.

","®@ HDS Building, 999 J.C. Aquino Avenue, Butuan City

CASE ABSTRACT

An evaluation of the customer satisfaction of Lasar Fast-food & Restaurant
was conducted. A descriptive method of research and a purposive-
convenience sampling technique were used in gathering the data. While, a
modified questionnaire was also developed in conducting the survey. The
study was conducted from June 2018 to October 2018. In analyzing the
results of the survey, the researchers used the frequency distribution and
Likert Scale. Three (3) dimensions (functionality, layout and ambience) were
used in evaluating the physical environment of the restaurant. The result of
the evaluation showed that customers are less satisfied to the physical
environment of the Lasar Fast-food & Restaurant. This means that the
functionality, layout, and ambiance of the restaurant fails to meet the
expectation of the customers. Out of the three (3) areas assessed, layout
got the highest weighted average of 2.49 with a verbal description of less
Satisfactory which means it is below customers’ expectation. On contrary,
functionality got the lowest average weighted mean of 2.33 with a verbal
description of less satisfactory which means it is also below customers’
expectation level. Herein, the management fails to manage and update their
facilities for the customers. Therefore, the management should enhance and
improve the functionalities of their amenities in order to give optimal comfort
and convenience to their customers in order to increase customer loyalty
and patronage through a positive word of mouth.
","Case Overview

Lasar Fast-food & Restaurant is in the 1* floor of a two stores building
at T. Salado Street, Nasipit Agusan Del Norte, held by the owner of the
business. Their 2nd floors were occupied by the owner and stay-in employees
as its residence area. The buildings were concrete and its outside wall was
covered by green-colored tiles where a 3 dimensional oblong shaped worn
signage were attached. This plain tarpaulin-made signage was built in the
year 1990’s which highlights the word LASAR with red and black font and
white background color. Currently, the tarpaulin has holes and scratches and
the visible text left is the word lasar. Also, the light bulb inside the signage
was already damaged making it not visible to the public at night. According to

the owner, from the year that they started to manage the business, they did
not change it to avoid expenses.

Upon entering the restaurant, the first thing to see is the dining area

where in the left side is a long transparent food stand that displays the ready-

made foods. The walls inside of the building are painted with yellow and blue

colors, while the ceiling is painted with white color. There are 20 pieces of
balloons that has a color of red and yellow and different sizes displayed at the
center ceiling of the dining area together with the bird-shaped colored origami.
In the right side of the store, there is a long mirror that occupied the wall of the
dining area in front of the cashier where a 4 meters long red, green and yellow

clothes skirting décor was shown.

Lasar Fast-food & Restaurant has two (2) speaker and one (1)
television in its dining area. However, the owner decided not to use speaker
and flat screen television at all times in order for them to lessen the expense
and for the customer not to stand by. There are two (2) air conditioner and two
(2) ceiling fan also to cool the place. One (1) air conditioner is placed on the
top of the cashier area and the other one (1) is placed in the right corner near
in the entrance door facing to the whole dining area. However, they only turn
on the air conditioner during peak hours. In this case, the customers still

complain on the hot temperature in the dining area.

The dining area of Lasar Fast-Food & Restaurant has four (4) light
bulbs; each bulb has 9 watts. The one (1) bulb is placed near in the food
Stand and cashier area. The other three (3) bulbs are placed in the dining
area a line towards the entrance of the kitchen and the other one (1) bulb is in
the comfort room. The owner chose to turn on three (3) light bulbs, one (1) in

the counter area and the other two (2) in the right side of the dining area in
order to lessen its electricity bills.

The restaurant has two (2) comfort rooms, one (1) for men and one (1)
for women. One (1) of the comfort room is out of order for it was damage, they
only used one (1) comfort room to all dine-in customers. As stated by the
owner, they temporarily used pail and “tabo"" to flush due to the flushing button
is not functioning. According to the management some of their customers are
asking about where the comfort room is located in the reason that there is no
directional signage that indicates the location of the comfort room. In addition,
the customers also have to ask assistance in locating the wash area of the

establishment for it was situated inside its kitchen.

Lasar Fast Food & Restaurant has six (6) tables and twelve (12) long

The figure 2 above shows the annual number of dine-in customers of
Lasar Fast-food & Restaurant from the year 2015-2017 based on the data
provided of the business. In that year 2016 the business is experiencing a
decrease number of customers. As the management stated, some of their
customers prefer to take out than to dine in especially during peak hours.
They also noticed the existence of their competitor, they thought of some
renovation in changing the color of the wall into yellow and blue while the
ceiling is white but the renovation is limited to avoid other expenses.

In the year 2017 the number of customer continues to decrease.
According to the management whenever they have orders or catering they
occupied some tables of the dining area for their preparations. The employees
cannot cater the number of customer who wants to dine-in especially peak

"EVALUATION ON INVENTORY MANAGEMENT OF ANGGING DRY
GOODS STORE IN BUENAVISTA, AGUSAN DEL NORTE
","CASE ABSTRACT

Evaluation on Inventory Management of Angging Dry Goods Store in
Buenavista, Agusan del Norte was assessed. There were areas subjected to
the study (forecasting, ordering and controlling) to help the management
change their traditional way of inventory management. The study used the
descriptive method of research and a purposive-complete enumeration
sampling method. About 8 respondents were analyzed that includes the store
manager, cashier, six sales ladies. Results showed that in evaluating the
inventory management of the store, forecasting, ordering and controlling has
a weighted mean of 2.40, 2.80, and 1.43, respectively. In terms of forecasting,
the management lacks knowledge in forecasting that causes them to have
incorrect forecasting of the demand. In ordering, the management does not
have a reorder point for their inventory which causes them to order stocks
always from their suppliers. In controlling, the management lacks control over
its inventory and failed to follow any standard practices. It was concluded that
the areas mentioned above contributed to the increasing number of slow-
moving stocks made for bargain below its Original cost which results in the
decrease of the company's net income of the said store. The management
should adopt the FIFO method and POS to have control of the inventory and

avoid obsolescence stocks and conduct training and seminars to educate the
employees of the store.
","Case Overview

Angging Dry Goods Store offered their product for cash and credit
basis. Credit was offered to selected customers like teachers, government
employees, and farmers. They offer credit up to Php20,000.00 without
collateral. The store manager also stated that they have a mark-up price of
20% in every product they sell. She added that there are times when the price
of the new stocks differs from the old stocks. In cases like this, the price of the
old stocks cannot be adjusted to the new prices since they already practiced
that kind of pricing.

She added that they let the customer chose what they wanted. As the

4

customer enters the store, they already knew what they need, so the sales
lady only assists the customer if they have queries about the sizes or the
prices of the product. And if the customer cannot find particular products, they
are looking for that would be the time that the sales ladies would promote their
new products available to their customers by offering it to them.

According to the store manager, there are times that they do not
consider the quality of the product. For them, if the product has a lower price,
it means that it has low quality and if the product was expensive, they think
that it has high quality. Most of the times, they based the quality of the
products on the price. In terms of promoting their products to the customers,
aside from bargaining their products, they also promote the store and its
products through radio advertisements during Christmas season. Also, when
it comes to Christmas seasons, the store gives a customized calendar to its
customers.

The store used the Last In, First Out (LIFO) method in which the last
items that arrive would be the first one to be sold. As the new stocks arrived,
the new products were placed on top of the shelves together with the old
ones. The stock on top was the first one to be chosen as it was visible and
accessible to pick. Based on the store manager, it was also another reason
why they have an increasing number of old products because those untrendy
products were still stored inside the store and acquire defects from being

stored for months.

and slow-moving stocks monthly. Weekly suppliers were from Butuan,
Cagayan, and Ozamiz while monthly suppliers were from Cebu and Bohol.

The store manager stated that she was the in-charge in forecasting the
inventory for the store. She decided the quantity of stocks she would order
that she thinks can minimized the costs of inventory. Besides, the manager
stated that her basis for forecasting was the number of customers looking for
a certain product at a certain time. She always considers customer's wants,
needs, and preferences. The store manager also stated that she sometimes
used her intuition to forecast the demand.

Another way for her to forecast how much they need to order was by
counting their stocks left in the shelves to determine the number of quantities
they needed to order again. She added that they do not like to have a stock-
out, so they always replenished their stocks even if they still have a lot of
stock left. According to the store manager, in terms of seasonal items, their
basis for forecasting the demand was based on their experience from the
previous years. Also, they ordered additional fifty (50) to one hundred (100)
percent of their usual order they do during peak seasons.

In ordering products from the suppliers, the store manager stated that
they counted their inventory but rarely follows the counting. She indicated that
they monitored their inventory to check what products they would order and
after checking, she listed down all the products that needed to be restocked.
She would call or send a message to various suppliers that they need to order
an item. The manager added that every week, it was a routine for them to

order fast-moving and slow-moving stocks from their suppliers even if they still
have a lot of stocks, but the delivery for slow-moving stocks was monthly.

According to the store manager, they have an agreement with the
suppliers to purchase products from them. They also have an agreement that
the store can avail purchase discounts from its suppliers if they paid in cash or
can pay before the maturity date. Aside from discounts, there would be
freebies if the store would order in bulk. The regular supplier had its weekly or
monthly schedule to deliver the products ordered by the manager.

The manager added that if there are new and trendy products that was
offered to her by several suppliers, she would order a few of it for sample if it
was salable. If she found the said products salable and trendy based on the
opinions of her employees, she immediately orders it in bulk. They also
accept bulk orders from its customers in which they immediately send a
message to the supplier that they need that certain product.

Upon receiving of the products ordered from their suppliers, they check
and count the stocks if the number of stocks corresponds the indicated
quantity in the order sheet of the supplier. The store manager stated that one
of the sales ladies is in-charge in checking and counting the new stocks to
make sure that the products that has been purchased was in good condition.
The store manager keeps the order sheet. After all the counting and checking,
the stocks was then arranged to its designated shelves.

According to the store manager, there are times when there are
defective items found from the current delivery; they would inform first the

supplier before retuming the item. If there was a defective item from the
previous delivery, they returned it back to the supplier. She also added that
there are times when the suppliers did not replace the defective items for
months. In this case, she would total the amount of the defective items and
told the supplier to either deduct the amount to its new accounts or give them
a refund for the items. Some of the defective items that cannot be returned
are placed back on the shelves.

Based on the store manager, she controlled the maximum and
minimum level of inventory. She sets different levels for different products.
The fast-moving products such as textile and fabrics, ready-made uniforms
and rattan products were prioritized while the slow-moving products like
shoes, sandals, RTW’s, undergarments, bags, plastic wares, kitchen wares
and decors like curtains were left behind. If a product reached its minimum
level or fifty percent (50%) of the total quantity of the stock, she immediately
orders additional stocks.

The store manager stated that when there were new products that
arrived, the remaining old products were covered by the new products and the
old products available in the shelves were no longer visible as it was placed
under the new items. They categorized each product by section for them and
the customer to locate easily.

Dry goods like shoes, sandals, umbrellas, undergarments and some
aluminum kitchen wares that had rust, dents, peel and old items that are

According to the store manager, the leather shoes and sandals are the items
that easily get defected as it starts peeling when it is stocked for two (2) to
three (3) years. There are stocks in the store which are not included to the
annual ending inventory because it was from the stocks that are stored for five
(5) years beyond and are already considered as obsolete items. These stocks
are still found inside the store in hopes to be sold.

The defective and old stock are offered into a markdown or bargain
price below its original cost. There are times that they conduct markdowns or
bargaining at cost, but most of the time they offer it below its orginal cost.
They started bargaining items ten (10) years ago and offer bargained items to
their customers every month to cope up with the costs incurred for the old
stocks. In bargaining the items, they sell it below its original cost. Some of the
slow-moving items are paired with the fast-moving items. The manager stated
that it is the best way to reduce their inventory and so that it would be sold
easily. Every year, the quantity of old stocks increases. Some of the old
stocks, specifically shoes, sandals and kitchen wares were purchased from
the previous years and remained displayed.

store. Credit sales is thirty percent (30%) of the total annual sales while
seventy percent (70%) of it is generated from cash. The bargain sales for the

from contractors through calls and text. They also offered supplies on the
small hardware here in Butuan City.

If a contractor wanted to avail supplies on credit, he or she would ask
for assistance regarding the supplies that he needed. If the supplies were
available, he would tell the secretary or manager that he wanted to purchase
supplies on credit. After that, the secretary or manager would inform the
owner that there was a contractor who wanted to purchase supplies, then on,
the contractor would talk with the owner and would show his contractor's
license and valid ID (government issued). The contractor would give his credit
application form together with the purchase order. After that, the owner and
contractor would discuss the credit terms. The owner would check the
contractors capacity to pay, and then, he would give a credit limit to the
contractor.

Based on the secretary, replacement on damaged supplies can only be
replaced on or before the due date of purchasing them, on the other hand, the
management would not accept any replacement when it was over the due
date. If the contractor was unable to Pay on his chosen credit term, then he

The contractors were classified into two: the new and old contractors.
New contractors were those contractors who purchased hardware and
construction supplies for a year. They were given a credit limit of
Php300,000.00 while old contractors were those contractors, who purchased
supplies for more than a year and were given a credit limit of
Php1,000,000.00.

The contractors were recommended by either the owners or
manager's friend; otherwise, they cannot avail supplies. The business was not
conducting credit investigation when there was a contractor who wanted to
avail credit since the owner or managers friend was recommending him.
Based on the secretary, they did not conduct a credit investigation because
the business was not that big and just owned by one person.

The owner was the only person who can approve or reject the
contractors’ request to purchase supplies from the business. It was not
necessary for the contractor to give collateral, but if they wanted to, they
offered collateral such as trucks, cars or real estate. If the contractor were an
active and good payer of his credit, the owner would extend his credit limit, on
the other hand, if the contractor frequently pays on a past-due date, the owner
would decrease his credit limit.

According to the manager, some contractors were not able to pay their

delinquent account, because sometimes their project had poor field
performance and that lead to project loss. There were instances that the
organization or the one who hired them suffered bankruptcy or had insufficient
capital or profit to pay their credit.

In line with this, according to the owner of the business, there were
occasions that the business was not able to pay the supplies, because some
of the contractors pay their credit not on time or they pay after the given
period which is after 30 days after they purchased the supplies. There were
also cases that the business lost sales, because there was no stock of items
or the stock was not enough to be sold by the other customers.

representatives about the collection which resulted to a late update of their
private customers. The management tried to collect the payment of their
customer but they failed because they are not consistent in sending notices. It
happened that the customer has a lot of reason to refuse the payment.

customers. Based on the management, they personally visit the customer and
gave them an option such as the payment plan. After that, the management
forgot to follow-up again and collect the customer about the said payment
plan.

This study aims to evaluate the implementation of collectio

management practices of Datalan Communication Services to come up with a

possible solution, to minimize if not totally resolve the current problem which

is the slow turnover in collecting accounts receivable and incurring of large

overdue accounts.

The focus of the study includes six (6) areas, the credit reminders,
methods of payment, rewards for punctual or on-time payment, grace period,

penalties for late payments, and process of litigation.

The study engaged the purposive convenience sampling in choosing
only those customers who were available during the routing of the survey

questionnaires for the data gathering were considered as respondents.

The over-all rating of the collection management practices evaluation is
1.97 which resulted to verbal rating of Sometimes. The implementation of
, collection management practices of Datalan Communication Services was
lenient of which practices are observed but applied in few instances which
affect the slow turnover of account receivables and incurs the large

percentage of overdue accounts.

Datalan Communication Services should add more efforts in reminding
the due accounts of the debtor and grant rewards to debtors who will pay a
week or so before due date. Datalan should strictly observe in giving

extensions of payments and pursue the litigation when debts reached one (1)

Table 1 specifies the classification of total sales percentage from 2013-

2015 comprised as cash and credit sales of the customers that are classified
as walk-ins, private and public organizations. Sales from walk-ins comprised
as cash to cash basis only, while customers from private and public
organization comprised to cash and credit sales. It indicates that both public
and private organizations have contributed higher percentage in terms of total

sales of the company than its walk ins customer.

In the year 2013, the total sales from walk-in customer is twenty-nine
percent (29%) cash to cash basis only, thirty-seven percent (37%) from
private organization split into cash sales of 2.7% and credit sales of 34.3%,
and thirty four percent (34%) from public organization which comprised of

Table 2 shows the annual credit sales in 2013-2015 with its total
collected payments, accounts receivable and allowance for bad debts. It
indicates that every year the accounts receivable are higher than the credit
sales collection. These will affect the company’s profitability because of the
slow capital recovery or impediment of cash flow that some even lead to bad

debt.

In the year 2013, the credit sale is P948, 168.00 in which P400, 140.00
or (48%) was collected, and the remaining accounts receivable is P548,
028.00 or (58%) which carried over to the next year’s accounts receivable.
This shows that the company is having hard time in collecting payments
because their return on credit has not reached one-hundred percent (100%)
of the annual credit sales, it was very alarming to the company because of

slow turnover in collecting receivables.

In the year 2014, Datalan restrained three (3) of customers from
private organization with an outstanding balance and discontinued the

services that caused the credit sales to decrease over fifteen percent (15%).

P362, 010.00 or (44%) out of P822, 568 or (100%) of the company’s annual
credit sales has been collected, and P460, 558 or (56%) is the remaining
accounts receivable. The company does not allow them to repurchase on
account temporarily and said to settle their accounts immediately. During this
year, Datalan litigated one of the debtors because he was not able to meet
the agreement after one (1) year of giving extension of payment. Credit
reminders and extensions of payment period were being made but still the

debtor did not pay his debt.

In the year 2015, the credit sales has increased over twenty-seven
percent (27%) from the previous year because of the increase demand of
computers and other computer related products in preparation for K-12
program of the private and public institutions. There was an increase of
number of customers at the same time its accounts receivable. The
company's credit customers have increased over thirteen percent (13%) from
the year 2014, three percent (3%) of this increase came from the private
organization and ten percent (10%) came from the public organizations. Forty-
six percent (46%) of the thirteen percent (13%) increase are the new
customers, thirty-one percent (31%) are the regular/old customers and the
twenty-three percent (23%) came from the old customers who have been
restrained to purchase on account in year 2014 but have paid their full
balance at the end of the year. During this period, P460, 147.00 or (44%) was

collected over its P1, 046,865 or 100% annual total credit sales.

Figure 2 shows the percentage contribution of private and public
organizations to the company’s annual credit sales from 2013 - 2015. The
graph indicates that private and public organizations are almost the same
when it comes to the credit sales of the company, and both organizations

affect the variance trend of credit sales from the year 2013 to 2015.

In the year 2013, the percentage contribution of private organizations is
fifty-two percent (52%) and forty-eight percent (48%) from public
organizations to company’s annual credit sales. In 2014, the percentage
contribution of private organizations is forty-nine percent (49%) and fifty-one
percent (51%) from public organizations to company's annual credit sales,
and in 2015, forty-seven percent (47%) and fifty-three percent (53%) from

private and public organizations respectively.

In extending credit sales, the company has its current practices in
granting credit. The regular customers have a verbal agreement with the
manager with regards to the credit terms. The public and private organizations

have documents presented in granting credit such as purchase order and

promissory note. The customers from private and public organizations are

given thirty (30) days to pay its debt as term for Credit.

The company’s current collection management practices in reminding
the accounts of the customers are: sending polite letter of reminder that
payment is overdue two (2) weeks before due date, telephone calls will be
made a week after the due date if payment is not yet settled. If the debtor will
not settle their accounts immediately after all the reminders are made, the

owner will request one of his staff to personally visit the debtor in his/her

convenience.

In collecting payments from private and public organizations, Datalan
grant rewards for punctual or on time payment as to offers an immediate
access to renewals of credit, an increase credit limit and offers two percent

(2%) discount to debtors who will pay a week or so before due date.

When customers cannot pay within the credit period for valid reasons,
Datalan gives debtors 1-30 days grace period to pay the full price and 180
days for the settlement of debt. The company considers the income status or
the stability of the company in extending the grace period more than 180 days

and grants “payable when able” to close friends.

Datalan charged penalties for late payments, a five percent (5%)

interest is applied when debt is not yet settled after the full payment period or

in 1-30 days grace period, and an interest of twelve percent (12%) will be

charged after 180 days grace period if account is still not settled. Datalan

does not allow debtors to repurchase on account unless they settle their all

unpaid obligations or a cancellation of credit lines.

After all the collection management practices were made and still the
payments are not collected. The last resort will then be the enforce litigation of
the customers who stil! have outstanding balances. Parties expressly submit
to the jurisdiction of the courts of Butuan City on any legal action arising out of
this transaction and additional sum equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the

amount due will be charge to attorney's fees for legal action.

"ASSESSMENT IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF COLLECTION
MANAGEMENT OF MANAPA AGRARIAN REFORM BENEFICIARIES AND
COMMMUNITY COOPERATIVE, BUENAVISTA, AGUSAN DEL NORTE
","CASE ABSTRACT

Assessment in the implementation of Collection Management of Manapa
Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries and Community Cooperative at Km.12, Purok 5,
Manapa, Buenavista, Agusan del Norte, was determined. There were three
areas of collection management employed (payment alternatives, monitoring
and follow-ups, and litigation). The researchers used purposive-complete
enumeration and random sampling method for both employees and
delinquent member borrowers. Also, used modified Likert Scale to analyzed
the data gathered. A total of 97 respondents were surveyed. Among the three
areas of collection management, payment alternatives got the highest
average weighted mean of 2.76 and 2.6 as both perceived by employees and
member borrowers with a verbal description of Often. It was followed by
monitoring and follow-ups with an average weighted mean of 2.68 and 2.53
as perceived by employees and member borrowers with both verbal
description of Often. The litigation got the lowest average weighted mean of
1.76 and 1.80 with a verbal description of Sometimes as perceived by
employees and member borrowers. Based on the results of the study, the
MARBCC was lenient in the implementation of its collection management that
leads to higher delinquent accounts that may affected the operation of the
cooperative. Thus, the researchers would like to recommend the following:
First is that the cooperative should hire an additional collector within the
member. Second, they must fully implement their policy with regards to co-
makers. Third, they should undergo litigation process through filing a lawsuit
against delinquent member borrowers. Fourth, they should send text message
prior to due date. Lastly, they should create a policy on automatic deduction of
capital savings for delinquent accounts.

because they want to personally pay their payments as well as received their
payment receipts. For those working member borrowers and to those who
have monthly pension such as senior citizen, retired government employees
and retired private employees. They chose payment through ATM because of
being busy with their work and to those senior citizens, they were not able to
went to the cooperative for the reason that they got easily tired. Payment

through collectors were for those member borrowers who resided far but still
within the community. According to them, it was hassle free that they would
Just wait for the collector instead of going to the office. Post-dated check was
for those members borrower who have an account in a bank who would want
to issue a check to the cooperative with a specific date as their payment.

","CASE ABSTRACT

The researchers conducted a study entitled Assessing Customers’ Satisfaction
in Physical Environment of Karl's Kitchenette in Buenavista, Agusan del Norte.
To assess the customer satisfaction of Karl's Kitchenette a purposive-
convenience research method is used. There were four (4) areas considered.
A modified questionnaire was developed and used a frequency distribution
table using the weighted mean. A total of 51 respondents is surveyed randomly
and able to answer the given questionnaires. Among the (4) four areas: Store
Signage, Spatial Layout, Ambiance, and Functionality results showed that

(2.30), and Store Signage (2.01) the result showed that all areas of physical
environment are below satisfactory and below customers’ expectation in the
Likert- Scale Model Interpretation. Thus, it suggests that the signage must be
improved in size while at night time this emphasized by installing light fixtures
to be visible. As for Spatial Layout, provide a kitchen cabinet, change the
boundary wall into a sliding door and window while the Ambiance, install an Air
Conditioner, add light bulb inside the kitchenette that has a maximum wattage,
change the wall paint that was already faded, add decoration that is classy and
is in line with the new trend. Lastly, for functionality, remake the menu list, clean
the fans regularly, remodel the main door, and change the torn out part of the
ceiling outside kitchenette. Thus, the outcome of the study reveals significant
information in the physical environment of Karl's Kitchenette.

have been affected. The calamity affects most of the borrowers that are why
they were not able to make repayment for their accounts. It was then followed
by a month-long drought that made the additional reason why farmer
members find it harder to pay their crop financing loans. For the following

year, the cooperative granted a series of a loan to the borrowers with the

confidence that they can re-loan to Land Bank. The collection activities went
slow that resulted to a failure of payment to Land Bank which in turn become
the reason that re-loan application to Land Bank to refinance their Rice

Production Loan was rejected unless they settle their outstanding loan.

cooperative is generated from the payment of different kinds of loans and its
interest income received. The cost of sales is the cost of the total amount lent
out to the member-borrowers which is decreasing because of the limited
amount released by the cooperative. The operating expenses incurred by the
cooperative include Honorarium and Allowance, Drying, Milling and Hauling
Fees, Travel and Transportation, Repairs and Maintenance, Notarial Fee,
Permits and Licenses, Freight and Handling, Commission/Incentive, Office
and Other Supplies, General Assembly Expenses, and Miscellaneous
Expense. The cooperative failed to pay its amortization to Agricultural
Guarantee Fund Pool (AGFP) in two consecutive years, 2016 to 2017. The
net surplus for allocation has been decreasing because according to the
manager, the amounts released has also been declining as presented above.
The bookkeeper prepares a monthly list of payments and their due
date. The management stated that the priority when they received cash from
borrowers is allotted to a payment of their monthly payables at Land Bank.
Besides, apart from their loan in Land Bank, the cooperative acquired series
of a loan from City Coop of two hundred thousand pesos (Php200,000.00),
and Agricultural Guarantee Fund Pool (AGFP) of two million pesos
(Php2,000,000.00) to aid their insufficient funds. The funds could be used to
grant loans to members. The City Coop gave a loan to SGMPC for a capital of
their Palay Trading in 2014 which is payable for two (2) years with no interest.

Palay Trading is the purchase of the rice grain from the farmer members who

wish to sell it to the cooperative. The cooperative would be the one to convert
it into the rice and then resell it. The manager stated that they stopped the
operation of palay trading because some of the farmers will not sell their rice
grain to the cooperative. The manager also said that when they encountered
the restructured loan to the Land Bank, the collection of the trading lessen.
Funds from other business operation are used to pay the monthly obligation to
the bank, and the management decided to stop the operation of Palay Trading
in 2015. The first payment of the loan was made in the third (3°9) quarter of
2017 with the amount of fifty thousand pesos (Php50,000.00) per quarter. The
management also added that the payment for the AGFP loan depends on
their collection in which their priority is the payment to Land Bank, this made
the management unable to pay their obligation to AGFP in the years 2016 and
2017. The management stated that they tried to link some financing agencies
to aid and sustain their operation and monthly payables. Unfortunately, they
were always denied due to the unconvincing financial status of the
cooperative.

The cooperative invests their other funds to some organization. They
invest in their partner cooperative, Malambuon Multi-Purpose Cooperative, of
one hundred twenty seven thousand pesos (P127,000.00). The cooperative
also invests in Butuan City Credit Surety Fund under the Bangko Sentral ng
Pilipinas of one hundred thousand pesos (P100,000.00). The cooperative can

loan ten (10) times the investment which can be used to grant a loan to

borrowers. The management reviews its investment to determine if there have
been any significant changes and to track the return. They also added that it
is done on the availability of the authorized person.

In addition, the management stated that they tried to affiliate on
organizations such as Federation of Peoples Sustainable Development

"TRAFFIC CONGESTION DETECTION WITH ALTERNATIVE PATH
RECOMMENDATION
","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Traffic Congestion Detection with Alternative Path Recommendation is
designed mainly to aid the private drivers in avoiding traffic with the use of its features

in providing real time traffic status and alternative path.

Through study, the researchers determined a number of existing applications
that have the same features and are already used by private drivers. Therefore,
researchers used the traditional transport and vehicular systems that used a V2V
communication, in which data are reliant to the users. Thus, the researchers provided
a feature that is not available to any existing application such as using a CCTV to
provide a real time traffic status and an alternative path. With these features, the
researchers believed that it could really be a good help to private drivers in order to
easily check the traffic status of a specific road, avoid traffic, and shift to routes with

less traffic congestion.

To end, the researchers therefore concluded that the Traffic Congestion
Detection with Alternative Path Recommendation was able to achieve the objectives

and it can be used for future application purposes.
","Chapter 1

1.1 Introduction

Nowadays, application is used to provide access for road status. The
increase of transportation in society causes many problems. Such annual
economic loss caused by traffic congestion. Cities showed a large increase in
road traffic which leads to deterioration in capacity and disorganized traffic

system.

In Metro Manila the heavy traffic is due to many factors such as the over
population of residents, congestion of private vehicles, inefficient services of rail
transportation, and the ineffective traffic control management in the country’s
capital region (Rig Man, 2015). Traffic congestion in Butuan City is now apparent
due to the rapid increase of growth rate, that as of 2007 the number of
population is 298,378 while in 2015 was only 337,063 people. (census.gov.ph,
2016). A total of 81,901 licensed private cars, excluding the pending plastic
license plate from August 2015 to January 2017, the inadequacy of transit
options is the obstacle that causes blockage and merger. Double parking, road

works, and narrow roads also caused traffic in Butuan City.

A real time monitoring of traffic information is obtainable with the help of
CCTV camera. A simple image processing on the frames to estimate traffic

density based on analysis of traffic images from live traffic feed that can identify
traffic status. The researchers used a customized Haar Classifier in OpenCV to

detect and count the number of cars recognize by the CCTV.

Thus, identifying traffic status is relevant for the development of Traffic
Congestion Detection with Alternative Path Recommendation (T CD-APR). An
application designed to detect the real-time state of traffic congestion that
allows user to search desired destination and to provide an alternative path.
The advance GPS can mitigate this by finding less congested routes. Hence,
the study aims to lessen the traffic congestion, and provide alternative path to

improve the economic development in Butuan City.

"ANDI’S SNACKBREAK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Andi’s Snackbreak Management System was conceptualized based on
the problems encountered by the management and staff with their Traditional
Processes. The management system covers the major processes mainly:
registration of product, employee profiling, assigning employee, and
assessment of orders. The study aims to turn manual system into a modernized

one. It makes the task easier and eliminates the use of manual processing.

Based on the gathered result, the system is indeed helpful in processing
the transactions. The result was weighted through the usability test scale of the
system and the scoring was based on the mathematical standard of system
usability test scale. The proponents conclude that through the use of the
proposed Management System, the owner, who will become the admin, can
manually add, collect and retrieve products and employee information, and can
also review all transaction logs Also, the cashier can follow up and check the
customer's order and lastly, the employee can monitor and check their pay

income daily and also access their personal information.

A system and appertaining methods are provided that make it possible
to order pizza and other products using an instant messaging or other signaling
mechanisms such as cellular phones and two-way pagers, using a tokenized
representation of the order elements (Kargman, 2011). The system and method
provide for issuing an employee an identifier (Stoutenburg, 1999). Production
planning has among its objectives the determination of inventory levels. In this
paper, we are primarily concerned with inventories that are involved in the
industrial production, namely inventories of raw materials, purchased and
manufactured parts, subassemblies, assemblies, and finished products (Hax,
1979). A computer system and method is used for processing bills for a vast
number of customers of a plurality of node systems within a larger system, with
each customer bill having a particular billing cycle, which comprises of a
memory for storing a plurality of customer bill records containing raw data to be

processed to generate 4 customer bill (Cohen, 2002). A portable electronic

device includes a queuing system (Lee, 2014).

"PHONE SECURITY ANDROID APPLICATION
","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The proponents have decided to develop an android phone
security application that could help mitigate the increasing number of missing
phones. The descriptive method of research was used in this study. Surveys
and interviews were conducted in order to know their experiences in losing their
smartphones. The developed application is basically a mobile application which
the user can monitor their phone if their phone is in lost mode with the help of
the features that the developer implemented. One of the objective of this study
is to develop the features in tracing and protecting your android smartphones if
ever it is stolen or gone missing and in longer term will help mitigate phone
missing cases. This will also give benefits to the users because it will somehow
lessen their worries in losing their smartphones. The proponents use a Global
Positioning System (GPS) and Google Map in their application for tracking the

lost phone and monitor it with another devices where it is registered as a backup
phone. The Proponents choose Android Operating System (aOS) in developing
the project for it has a great number people using this mobile operating system
and it is always on demand in every marketplace. The development of this
project is patterned with the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Agile
Approach. The proponents used the agile as a guide to get their goals and to

have an effective and efficient mobile application.
","Chapter |

1.1 Introduction

As of early 2013, 56 percent of American adults owned smart phones,
and by the end of 2014, there were nearly 7 billions mobile cellular
subscribers worldwide. We believe it is inevitable that these devices will
become the primary portals by which humans interact with services, including
remote services (e.g. banking) and more local ones (e.g. Automatic Teller
Machines) (Libonati, A., et al., 2014). Because these devices are vulnerable
to theft, security of this data is put at higher risk-once the attacker is in
physical possession of the device, recovering these credentials and
impersonating the owner of the phone is hard to defend by purely local
means. (Caine, K., et al., 2014). Global Position System (GPS) is a
technology where satellites send down radio signals. In utilizing this
technology, user can locate the exact address of the thief. (Danu, R. 2016).
This application uses the latest technology like Short Message Services;
(SMS) through using it, you can track theft’s current location IMSI number
changed. (Kumar, R. V., et al., 2015). A number of researchers are being held
on the issue of obtaining private information on Android devices using
multimedia such as microphones and cameras. One of the issues is basic
camera attack model. This kind of attack will capture image secretly from

Android device camera without getting known to user. We will use this
disadvantage in a positive direction to control device and collect information

from device remotely. (Chouhan, J. G., et al., 2016).

Seeing many of these missing cases, we tried to develop a system for
tracking and securing a missing phone. (Krisitan, Y et al., 2013). With an
increasing number of organizations allowing personal smart phones onto their
networks, considerable security risk was introduced. The security risk is
exacerbated by the tremendous heterogeneity of the personal mobile devices
and their respective installed pool of applications. (Van Bruggen, D., et al.,
2013). It's not the device itself that's so valuable to those victims, but the data
stored on those smartphones, as Lookout notes. This includes anything from
photos to videos, contacts, music, apps, and banking information. The survey
also found that 44% of smartphones were stolen because owners had
forgotten them in a public setting, and 14% of devices were taken from a car
or house that was burglarized. Only 11% of victims had their smartphone

stolen off personally. (Eadicicco, L. 2014).

Though there are some android phone theft application that already
existed such as Android Device Manager, these applications can easily be by-
passed and rendered useless once the thief perform a factory reset on the
phone. This would turn the phone fresh as a new device. And also, these
applications heavily relies on Internet/Wi-Fi services alone and as such, if
there's no connection available to the device, these application wouldn't

properly execute their functions that could potentially help trackfocate the
stolen phone. In some instances, the thief would pull out the phone SIM card

which would make tracking even more difficult.

In response to the abovementioned problems, the proponents have
decided to develop an android phone security application that could help
mitigate the increasing number of missing phones. The features that were
implemented to the application is locating the current location of the phone
through Global Positioning System (GPS) and Short Messages Service (SMS)
as a trigger and it also has a feature that could capture the image of the thief.
When the SIM card is ejected from the phone, the application will
automatically acquire the new number of the phone and it will send the
information back to the tracker. The owner of the phone can send a trigger to
record the activity of the thief through audio recording, send a copy of SMS
conversation, and even call logs. The proponents took a counter measure in
response to the wiping of data through factory reset by rooting the phone and

converting the application to be recognized as a system app so that it can no

longer be uninstalled.

"DETERMINING POTENTIAL INVESTMENT AREAS OF
SURIGAO DEL NORTE
","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The province of Surigao del Norte is rich in natural resources where many
investors are interested in investing when it comes to the leading industries of
Fishery, Agriculture, Mining, and Eco-Tourism. Surigao del Norte is part of
CARAGA that envisions to be the FAME center of the country for the year 2030.
In contribution to the goal of the said region, the researchers come up with the
idea of creating an application that will help potential investors who wants to put
up a business in Surigao del Norte. With the application providing areas and

particular investments on the products of the area.

The proponents adapt the concept of Geographic Information System and
the idea of Decision Support System that will help the investor to expedite
decision making process by providing visual representation of the map of Surigao
del Norte using Open Street Map as the base map of the system. Together with
the map are the data relevant to Surigao del Norte like population density, hazard

susceptibility of a particular area, road maps, facilities, and networks.

During the testing, the proponents conducted a research using the System
Usability Scale Test that will help to evaluate the efficacy of the system. As a

result, the average percentage is 78.63. According to the score measurements
and industry standards, the system is good and doing okay but could use

improvements.

Introduction

1.1 Project Context

In today’s highly competitive and globalized economy, decision-makers
face tough challenges in managing investments in a sustainable and profitable
manner. One of the problems of investors is having costly mistakes upon
investing. Currently, investors still manually gather relevant data to guide them in
determining key investment areas pertaining to Fishery, Agriculture, Mining and
Eco-tourism (FAME) in the province of Surigao del Norte.

Investors often personally go to different agencies or government offices
in order for them to gather data, which will take a long period of time before
concluding which investment area to choose. Potential investors may utilize the
power of internet to conduct further research, but the disadvantage is that there
is no specific website to visit that generates the necessary data for their
evaluation and therefore, information gathered are unreliable for decision-
making.

Surigao del Norte is located in the Northeastern part of Mindanao between
425°15' to 126° 15° east longitude and 9° 18' to 10° 30° north latitude. It is
bounded on the North and East by the Pacific Ocean, on the South by the

Provinces of Agusan del Norte and Surigao del Sur and on the West by the
Surigao Strait. It belongs to the new region, the CARAGA Region, which is
composed of five (5) provinces and six (6) cities.

The CARAGA’s long-term development goal is to become the FAME
center of the country by the year 2030, by developing the region’s abundant
resources in fishery, agriculture, forestry, mining, and eco-tourism as growth
drivers of the region’s economy. (Revised Caraga RDP, 2013-2016)

The proposed system, Determining Potential Investment Areas for
Surigao del Norte (DPIA-SDN), is useful in providing visualization and spatial
analysis by using Geographic Information System (GIS) that has been long
used for data analysis, various researches and studies in areas such as land
use planning, environmental planning, and disaster management planning.
The recent innovations in GIS technology are becoming influential in leading
the market toward development of nationwide computerized open access.
This GIS technology together with Data Driven type of Decision Support
System will help serious prospective investors to determine which potential
areas to invest such as fishery, agriculture, mining, and eco-tourism.

Data Driven type of Decision Support System are form of support
system that focuses on the provision of internal data to aid decision making.
Most often this will come in the form of a data warehouse where the data will
be processed. A data-driven DSS helps to transform large data sets into
meaningful, easy to read business information.(FOIS, 2006) The best
example of a Data Driven DSS is the Geographical Information System which

can be used to visually represent geographically dependent data using maps.
(Dimitris Liparas, Nov 14, 2016) By presenting relevant information in maps

and satellite imagery, through access to a web browser, investors can perform

researches concerning

the categories of FAME. A rapidly accessed geographic data that can allow
smarter and more efficient decision-making to the investors and help them

avoid spending larger amount of cost on manual and physical research.

1.1 Introduction

Butuan City is located at the northeastern part of the Agusan
Valley, Mindanao, sprawling across the Agusan River. It is bounded to the north,
west and south by Agusan del Norte to the east by Agusan Del Sur and to the
northwest by Butuan Bay. The fact that the city is a plain low-lying area adjacent
to a river and a lake makes the place vulnerable to floods anytime the water level
rises. As most people are well aware, floods have large consequences for
communities and individuals including death, damage to property, loss of
livestock, and deterioration of health conditions owing to waterborne disease.
Flood is the most common calamity to strike Butuan City and it still occurs to the

present time, affecting many Butuanons.

According to Rey Francis B. Lincuna one of the Barangay Kagawad in
San Ignacio that numbers of individuals are not familiar with the safety guidelines
and the basic survival skills. During calamity, the most essential aspect of
surviving is to know the location of the large facility near you. Some
inexperienced individuals tend to neglect their responsibility towards keeping
each other safe, they are not aware of the basic protection rules. As a result, they
often think that their house is the safest place when in fact there are facilities that

accommodate people in transition during emergencies.

According to City Disaster Risk Reduction Management Office (CDRRMO)

officials, the common evacuation center in Butuan City is their school or covered
court. The people who are house fire victim and people who experience floods in
their places or any kinds of calamity would be evacuated to their nearest

evacuation center in their barangay.

Evacuation Center Locator using Geographical Information System
(ECLGIS), is all about locating the nearest evacuation center base on user’s
current location in Butuan City. The user should open the global positioning
system (GPS), on their smartphones and after that it would automatically
determine where they are. It would also give all nearest evacuation center based
on user current location. And the application would also identify if the evacuation
center nearest to the user is either school or covered court. So that user can
choose alternative places to go if an emergency occurs. For this reason, the
proponents come up with an idea on developing an android application that
would help the citizens of Butuan city on locating all nearest evacuation center

based on user current location.

4.1 Introduction

Agusan River Basin was known as the third largest river basin of the
Philippines. According to the Butuan City Disaster Risk Reduction and
Management office (CDRRMO) they can predict the water level of Agusan
River manually, by means of communicating with the affected barangay for an
update of their situation. Also the CDRRMO said that they only knew if a
barangay was already affected by the flood once they receive a call from that
barangay. After receiving any updates from the affected barangay they would
contact the Philippine Information Agency (PIA) to send warnings and alerts to
the people who live in the affected barangay. But according to Hon. Jullieto D.
Llagas chairman of barangay Poyohon they don’t have any connection with
CDRRMO they do things by their own during a flood. Based on this matter the
proponents decided to conduct a research and studies which leads them to
create the Agusan River Flood Monitoring using Raspberry Pi with SMS
Advisory.

Flooding has always resulting in enormous anxiety on countries across
the continent where by lost of life’s, people displaced, agricultural land
submerged in mud’s, roads, bridges and houses washed away (Suchita2014).
Although flooding was an abnormal phenomena agers ago, but now it was
considered a life treating natural disaster for the mankind (Siva, 2013). Over
the last 25 years Flood Early Warning System (FEWS) has been developed to
numerous rivers in the world (Vermeulen et al; 2014). Several expert have

Studies over the years on ways to improve flood control, thereby reducing risk
(Tomaszkiewicz, 2013).

The Agusan Rivers water level has been monitored and it has a
corresponding evacuation protocol for the people who live in the affected
area. Flood Alert level1 means that all residents of the affected barangay has
been alerted for them to be aware of the situation and danger. Flood Alert
Level 2 means that the vulnerable sector composed of elderly, children,
pregnant women, lactating mother and person with disabilities (PVVDS) to be
Pre-Emptively Evacuated. Flood Alert Level 3 means that the barangay
Officials, PNP, BFP must order residents of the affected barangay to evacuate
and proceed to Evacuation Center. But the BCDRRMO has difficulty of giving
warning to the people who live in the affected area in advance time because
they just wait for the Barangay official to contact them to report the situation
when the flood was already happening.

Therefore, the proponent decided to develop Agusan River Flood
Monitoring using Raspberry pi with SMS Advisory to give warning and help to
the residents of the affected barangays. If the water level of Agusan River
arises the system would automatically send an SMS to the residents of the
affected barangays containing the water level of the Agusan River together
with the location of the evacuation center. The system also provides
automatic reply to the residents of Butuan City, if they have any inquiries

regarding with the water level status of the Agusan River during rainy days.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Introduction

Currently, the world depends on technology and everyone from
young to old seems to be deeply involved. Technology has become
one of the most important elements in today's societies and its role in
our lives keeps getting complex. According to N. Anusha, A. D. Sai and
B. Srikar (2017) Facial recognition is commonly used nowadays for
security purposes and also a very accurate way of verifying a user
when logging in. Raspberry pi 3 is a small complete computer that has
a microprocessor and other features required of a functional computer
such as keyboard, mouse, camera, and memory. A key dispenser is a
system that contains a key and distributes it in a well-organized way for
the employees. The proponents will develop a system that will
implement the aspects of raspberry pi, face recognition, and key
dispenser that will serve the company as well as the employees and
staffs.

According to Renée Lynn Midrack (February 24, 2018) Facial
recognition technology is considered part of biometrics, the
measurement of biological data by devices or software, similar
to fingerprint scanning and eyeriris scanning systems. Computers use
facial recognition software to identify or verify a person by mapping
facial features, characteristics, and dimensions and comparing that

information with immense databases of faces. According to (/. Gupta,
V. Patil, C. Kadam and S. Dumbre, ""Face detection and
recognition using Raspberry Pi,"" 2016 IEEE International WIE
Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (WIECON-ECE).
Pune, 2016, pp. 83-86)

Face recognition has become one of the most important user
identification methods. According to Robert G. Spignesi Jr. Mark
Longley (2016) A system for dispensing a plurality of customized doses
of pharmaceuticals includes: a housing; a customized packaging
station configured to selectively package individual doses of medication
into customized packaging, and a controller connected to the customer

interaction station and the customized packaging station.

Companies today are still using manual process of distributing
keys for their rooms. What modern companies need nowadays is a
systematic way for this process. The old manual process will take time,
hassle and will delay the employee if the key is still in use and could
not identify who is using the key. Companies are still using a cabinet
where all the keys are placed, which may allow anyone to just get a
key easily even if it is not an authorized person. There are complains
that the keys are not placed and organized properly when returned to
the key holder. The person in-charge could not identify and could not
identify the last employee who used a key and will be a problem if it is

misplaced.

1.1 Introduction
In a general educational timetabling problem, a set of events courses
and exams are assigned into a certain number of timeslots (time periods)
subject to a set of constraints, which often makes the problem very difficult to
solve in real-world circumstances. There are large numbers of commercial
software packages available to assist with the timetabling problem. However,
due to the variety of characteristic procedure and complexity of each
university in the scheduling process make the study in this research area still
interesting. In order to solve the best solution for this timetabling problem, a
wide research area has been studied in various complexity problems with
different algorithm solution
Nowadays, some of the institutions lacks the proponents to ease or
to handle things, and since technology is improving, as IT developers the role
is to help some of those institutions that have in need of an upgrade, unlike

the traditional method that has been used by the scheduler for a long time.

The researchers aim to create an electronic system for
departmental examinations in ACLC Departmental Examination Scheduling
System (ADES) ACLC Butuan. The system would lessen the workload on the
scheduler’s side, through the help of the proposed system, conflicts on
schedules will be minimized and be organized, instead of using the manual
way of generating schedules, the proposed system will provide easier tabling.
And if the (ADES) ACLC Departmental Examination Scheduling System is

implemented it will be a system unlike before from the old methods that the
scheduler have been using. For this system enables users to save time and

effort and do other tasks in their work.

"SOLAR POWERED AUTOMATED DRYING RACK USING RASPBERRY PI
","ABSTRACT

This study is about the Solar Powered Automated Drying Rack Using
Raspberry Pi. The study is focused on developing a drying rack prototype that
would automatically hide and unhide due to rain instances. The researchers
anchored the study in Home Automation Systems Theory, thus, the study
provided two interfaces that would enable the users to automatically and
manually control the prototype. The study was conducted for the purpose of
finding a solution to the inconvenience that the raining probability gives
whenever clothes are hanged onto the drying rack in an open area. There is a
possibility that it might get wet if there is an unpredicted rain. Or, simply, no one
is around to take care of the clothes when it rains. The proponenis of the study
aimed to develop a solar powered drying rack prototype that would
automatically and manually hide and unhide due to rainfall detection and
weather forecast from the internet. The newly developed system must be
evaluated in terms of functionality, reliability, efficiency and usability. By utilizing
the Waterfall Development Model Methodology, the prototype was improved,
developed and implemented into a hardware product that would benefit people
of different walks of life in a community who are too occupied to monitor their
clothes in the drying rack. In addition, it can be an efficient solution to the
inconvenience since the prototype is solar powered, hence, weather monitoring
and controlling of the drying rack can be carried out at any time of the day
without worrying about power interruption. The prototype used relevant
technologies such as Raspberry Pi 3, Rain Sensor Module and Servo Motor for
rainfall detection and mechanical control of the drying rack. In addition, the
prototype integrated mobile application to remotely control the drying rack. The
study has reached its purpose in developing a solar powered automated drying
rack prototype using raspberry pi. The researchers concluded that the
developed system is acceptable in accordance to the ISO/IEC 9126-1 Quality
Standard Model.

1.1 Introduction

At present time, people have adapted to technological innovations In
carrying out their chores. The daily heavy workload and routines make it difficult
for people to manage their time (Rammohan et al., 2018). With existing and
evolving technologies nowadays, from machines to appliances and to
smartphones, people have resorted to conduct daily chores smartly and
electronically. These solutions for such tedious tasks make people of different
roles in the community comfortable and make them able to maximize their time.
Similarly, this study aims to provide solution to a certain task.

In the context of weather, it is impossible for it to be controlled. With this
facet condition, hanging washed clothes in the drying rack at open area would
be a person’s burden of raining probability (Rammohan et al., 2018). To ensure
the clothes in the drying rack from being wet without having to wait until it rains,
automation must be utilized. An automation system consists of a connection
between a hardware and software.

The development of Internet of Things (loT) indicates a change in the
accumulation of data. An increasing proportion of data collected today is
generated by sensors (Jyoti et al., 2016). These data generated from the
sensors are collected by microcontrollers that perform a wide variety of tasks.
The performance growth of microcontrollers has led their ability to manage
complex application. At the same time, there is a variety of manufacturers of
microcontrollers with many diverse types of processor and performance.

Raspberry P| belongs to the most widely used microcontrollers (Martinez,
2016). The Raspberry Pi 3 has been chosen as a microcontroller in order to
gather information from the rain sensor module and mechanically control the
drying rack. A Raspberry Pi is a credit-sized computer that you can use to
program practical projects. The Raspberry Pi is mainly utilized due to its low

cost and small size and its performance is almost comparable to a normal

computer.
Thus, a microcontroller, rain sensor module, a mechanical motor and

solar power source is relevant for the development of the Solar Powered

Automated Drying Rack. A prototype that mechanically hides and un-hides the

drying rack in every rainfall detection. The rain sensor module provides the

parameter that the study is concerned about. Hence, the study aimed to provide

a solution to the problem concerning rain probabilities whenever there are

clothes hanged in the drying rack.

ABSTRACT

Tracer study is an approach which is globally used in most organization
especially in the educational institutions to track and to keep a record of
students once graduated from the institution. This study aims to develop a
Decision Support System (DSS) tool that will analyze the systematic tracing of
graduates and make decisions based on the outcome of the forecast. Decision
Support System (DSS) is an information system that supports business or
organizational decision-making activities. This serves the management,
operations and planning levels of an organization and help people make
decisions about problems that may be rapidly changing and not easily specified
in advance. The proponents used Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average
(ARIMA) a time-series analysis model to forecast the future number of
graduates in the upcoming year as well as the graduate’s productivity and
competitiveness, also the number of employed and unemployed graduates. To
improve decision making and analyzing of data; to generate statistical results a
decision support system tool must be develop. The proponents conducted a
survey to test the developed system’s efficiency to the graduates as the
respondents and was acceptable based on the obtained 3.95 mean average.
With that, the proponents developed a decision support system that would give
assistance to the institution on the decision-making and planning preparation
regarding on how to improve the curricular programs of BS in Information
Technology, BS in Computer Science, BS in Business Administration major in

Financial Management, BS in Business Administration major in Marketing

INTRODUCTION

A study of (Gonzales, 2017) states that tracer studies have been used
as an evaluating tool for the transition of the students from their education to
their profession. It aims to track the professional development of graduates with
regards to the relevance of their skills and training acquired from the university.
According to Prof. Adelaida C. Gines, PhD. in the Philippines, the Commission
on Higher Education requires all Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to conduct
a tracer study and is equally reflected as one of the required documents by any
higher education accrediting body such as the Philippine Association of
Colleges and Universities Commission on Accreditation (PACUCOA) for
private schools. Forecasting is a common statistical task in business, where
it helps to inform decisions about the scheduling of production, transportation

and personnel, and provides a guide to long-term strategic planning.
(Hyndman and Athanasopoulos, 2018).

A study of Dato’ Seri Mohamed Khaled bin Nordin and Menteri
Pengajian Tinggi cited that Graduate Tracer Study has proven to be an
effective method in getting accurate and quick inputs for ensuring the human
capital produced by higher education institutions are at all times relevant and
be able to meet the ever-changing demand of job market. The Association of
African Universities or AAU, and Boaduo, Mensah and Babitseng, explain
that tracer studies enable the contextualization of graduates of a university
through a system that is dynamic and reliable to determine their life path or
movement. It also enables the evaluation of the results of the education and
training provided by an institution and examines and evaluates the current

and future career and employment opportunities or prospects of graduates.
2

In today's era, most of the universities and colleges are using the
Graduate tracer system to trace the graduates on how much they have
improved after graduated and which field of work they are in. However,
graduate tracer alone cannot give an accurate result if the certain institution is
doing well in implementing their academic programs. Thus, through Time-
Series Analysis method, it can be used to understand past data as well as to
predict the future. Furthermore, Decision Support System (DSS) can provide a
decision with effective mechanisms to better understand the decision problem
and the implications of their decision behaviors of the organization by allowing
them to interactively exchange information between the system and
themselves. Moreover, the institution can easily grasp result on the academic
status of the graduating student on what field of expertise they are going to take

and on what improvements might the institution would do.

Thus, the proponents came up with the idea of developing ACLC
Graduate Tracer and Forecasting using Time-Series Analysis to forecast the
graduates’ productivity on the field they choose. Also, to graphically generate
results on the statistics of how many graduates are employed and unemployed.
To measure if the graduates are productive and globally competitive, and to
forecast the number of future graduates, the proponents used AutoRegressive
Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). ARIMA model’s goal is to predict future
moves by examining the differences between values in the series instead of
through actual values. Consequently, ACLC Graduate Tracer and Forecasting
using Time-Series Analysis is a Decision Support System tool that can predict
trends and future values. Further, it can generate graphical results and report

that can help the institution for future decision making.

"ACLC DEPARTMENTAL EXAMINATION SCHEDULING SYSTEM
","ABSTRACT

The proposed ACLC Departmental Scheduling System was created
and designed to supply the needs of the client. The researchers gathered all
the data in order to develop a system which created schedules for the users
freed from hassle going to school just to look for their exam schedules.
Further saying this system is useful for the scheduler and also for the students
to determine their respected schedules. For the instructors, with their busy

schedules, they can save time looking for their exam schedule that they are

going to proctor.

The researchers aim to create an electronic system for departmental
examinations in ACLC Departmental Examination Scheduling System (ADES)
ACLC Butuan while the scheduler stands as an admin and the one who
creates the entire schedule for the departmental examination. The HR can
only view the schedule and indicate the time for the proctors. The instructor

and student can only view their schedule through the mobile app.

The researcher successfully created the system which really helps not

just for the students but also for the scheduler to view their exam schedules.

The researchers, therefore, concluded based on the testing phase that
on the student’s side, they fount out that the application is appropriate and
accessible to the students. On the other hand, teachers or instructors also

appreciated the function of the application, especially the viewing of the exam

schedules.

1.1 Introduction
In a general educational timetabling problem, a set of events courses
and exams are assigned into a certain number of timeslots (time periods)
subject to a set of constraints, which often makes the problem very difficult to
solve in real-world circumstances. There are large numbers of commercial
software packages available to assist with the timetabling problem. However,
due to the variety of characteristic procedure and complexity of each
university in the scheduling process make the study in this research area still
interesting. In order to solve the best solution for this timetabling problem, a
wide research area has been studied in various complexity problems with
different algorithm solution
Nowadays, some of the institutions lacks the proponents to ease or
to handle things, and since technology is improving, as IT developers the role
is to help some of those institutions that have in need of an upgrade, unlike

the traditional method that has been used by the scheduler for a long time.

The researchers aim to create an electronic system for
departmental examinations in ACLC Departmental Examination Scheduling
System (ADES) ACLC Butuan. The system would lessen the workload on the
schedulers side, through the help of the proposed system, conflicts on
schedules will be minimized and be organized, instead of using the manual
way of generating schedules, the proposed system will provide easier tabling.
And if the (ADES) ACLC Departmental Examination Scheduling System is

implemented it will be a system unlike before from the old methods that the
scheduler have been using, For this system enables users to save time and

","INTRODUCTION

Technology runs our lives these days. Technology gets feasible in

practical terms and many people cannot imagine a life without it (D. Lamey,

2018). Technology involves information systems and it gives significance to any

businesses, because to have accurate information is much needed in
businesses. The need to have the technology as a tool for solving problems
and at the same time increasing the productivity and the quality of doing

business is also vital. Businesses today use information system and use the
available technologies because they understand the importance of maintaining

and updating data electronically (""A web-based integrated”, 2009).

However, resistance to change has been suggested as one of the factors
that has constrained the capability of healthcare organizations to improve
performance (""Identifying the sources of resistance to change’, 2017). As
noted, the inability of healthcare organizations to adapt to the changing
demands of highly competitive market is a barrier to their sustainability
(""Identifying the sources of resistance to change"", 2017). In addition, the pace
of healthcare change is accelerating, and will remain in this rapid state as the
sector continues to experience remarkable change resulting to market shifts
and the introduction of new technologies (""Identifying the sources of resistance
to change”, 2017). Moreover, health care must face the rapid development of
technology, competition, new business-like organization structures and

thinking, strategic management, etc. (""Managing the information systems’,

2014).
To address the predicament, Information and Communication
Technology (ICT) should be engrafted in healthcare organizations because
using information system for managing information in the health care such as
patient record, patient appointment system, patient scheduling appointment,
doctor schedule and medicine prescription is not only to save time or reduce
cost, but also a way to support and improve the health care information to be
more accessible and flexible for system users and storing data efficiently.

Furthermore, it improves the quality of data control (""A web-based integrated”,

2009).

The challenge here is how information system can represent and
manage the entire data and information in the healthcare center such as patient
information, patient appointment, doctor's schedule, payment and medicines.
Moreover, it is also a challenge on how an information system serves a way to
make healthcare organization attain efficiency, reliability and security relating

to healthcare services.

"MEASURING THE LEVEL OF THE AMMONIA GAS IN A COMFORT ROOM
WITH FLUSHING MECHANISM ACTIVATION AND NOTIFICATION
FEATURES USING RASPBERRY Pl
","ABSTRACT

This study is about Measuring the Level of Ammonia Gas in a Comfort Room
with Flushing Mechanism Activation and Notification Features using
Raspberry Pi. The study was conducted with the purpose of maintaining the
sanitary condition of the comfort room and eliminating foul smell of urine, to
save water, energy and to minimize the work of the utility workers. The
researchers of the study developed a prototype that can detect if the level of
ammonia gas in the comfort room is high and will automatically flush the toilet
bowl, send a notification to the cleaners that the comfort room is in need of
cleaning; the exhaust fan will tum on automatically for 5 minutes only and will
automatically turn off. The air freshener will automatically turn on after the
exhaust fan is off and it will spray for at least 3 minutes. The newly developed
system must be evaluated in terms of functionality, reliability, efficiency and
usability. By using the Waterfall Development Model Methodology, the
prototype was developed and implemented into a hardware output that would
benefit different establishments and its utility workers. The prototype used
technologies such as Raspberry Pi 3, MQ137 Ammonia Gas Sensor, Exhaust
Fan, Air Freshener and Servo Motor for mechanical control of the toilet bowl's
flush. In addition, the prototype integrated mobile application for receiving
notification via internet. The study had reached its purpose and main
objectives. The researchers concluded that the developed system was
acceptable in accordance to the ISO/IEC Software Quality Test.

Keywords: Ammonia Gas, Detection, Flushing, Notifications, Raspberry Pi

","INTRODUCTION

Found in this chapter are the rationale of the study, project context, the
objectives of the study and the scopes and limitations.
4.1 Rationale of the Study

Every establishment such as malls, fast food chains, restaurants,
hospitals and schools have comfort rooms. In places like this, every day
different people use the toilet for excretion of waste or to urinate. However,
shared facilities were not recognized as improved sanitation due to challenges
of maintenance (Caimcross et. al., 2017). Though public washrooms have
janitors for cleaning, management depends on the users. If users do not work
collectively towards keeping the facility clean, it is likely that the quality may

depreciate due to lack of maintenance (Rheingans et. al, 2017).

According to Air-Scent, 2017, the common source of bad odor in
comfort room is urine. The warm, acidic fluid is an excellent food source of
odor-causing bacteria and as they multiply, so does the intensity of odor.
Urine is a waste produced in the kidneys that filters out harmful elements. It
also contains various salts, carbohydrates, and fatty acids, trace amounts of
hormones, nitrogen and urea. Bacteria feed on protein, urea and
carbohydrates which create other byproduct called hydrogen sulfide and
various ammonia compounds, which are offensive to our nostrils. Due to poor
ventilation in public washroom, ammonia smell stinks (Banerjee, 2016). The
New York Department of Health describes ammonia gas as a colorless,

alkaline gas comprised of nitrogen and hydrogen (NH3) that has a strong
odor. However, ammonia found in urine is actually urea, which is a processed
form of ammonia, and carbon dioxide in the liver and it is non-toxic. Even
though it is non-toxic ammonia smells bad in a comfort room it is because
overly rated exhausts fans is also one of the reason why the smell of
ammonia in the comfort room worsen. Since rest rooms have tightly closed
doors and windows, no fresh air suction or entry is possible and in such
scenario, the exhaust system tends to pull out gasses from drain (Banerjee,
2016). Aside from regular and thorough cleanings, restroom can be equipped

with a device and other tools to ensure a healthy and clean experience.

To address this problem, the researchers developed a study on
Measuring the Level of Ammonia Gas in a Comfort Room with Flushing
Mechanism Activation and Notification Features Using Raspberry Pi. The
developed project can sense and measure the level of ammonia gas present
in the comfort room. It will automatically turn on/off the exhaust fan then spray
an air freshener. It will also activate the flush that automatically flush the toilet
bowls. It can also send a notification to the cleaner if the comfort room is in

need of cleaning.

INTRODUCTION

Search engines can bring up thousands of recipes for any
given dish.Surely you will choose the one that does not need you to
rush to the supermarket to buy the missing ingredients. Often times you
can make that effort, especially if you have guests coming over for a
meal. But if you are feeling tired or lazy and just want to prepare
something satisfying out of whatever you have in your fridge, the usual

cookbook would not work. You need a reverse-recipe search engine.

According to (Nwachukwu, 2015), Expert System is an
intelligent computer program that uses knowledge from an inference to
solve problem that are difficult enough to require significant human
expertise for their solution and according to (Jackson 1999), an expert
system is a computer program and reasons with knowledge of some

specialist subject with a vi ew to solving problems or giving advice.

"REAL ESTATE REGISTRATION SYSTEM WITH GEOGRAPHIC
INFORMATION SYSTEM (GIS)
","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Real estate registration systems are systems or software that keep
track of real properties available for sale. Using these systems, one can view
information on real estate properties without the need to visit the actual sites.
It also provides system administrators means to keep records of the
transactions involved in the sale of real properties.

GIS is a computer system for storing, displaying, checking related data
about the position on earth surface. GIS can show data in one map to help
people analyze and compare and differentiate the relationship of things in the
earth’s terrain. It also includes locations such as farms, housing and other
relevant establishments.

The Real Estate Registration System with GIS will provide potential
buyers a means to search desired locations at a glance. This is made
possible by utilizing accurate GlS-based maps and up-to-date data from the
local Land Registration Authority. It also lifts the burden from the land sellers
in advertising their properties and alleviates the hassle in real estate sales
processing. With the help of the GlS-based property finder, viewers can use
smartphones or tablets with browsers to easily access the site. The system

also track the available property for sale and it can locate exact location of the

property instead of visiting personally.

The Real Estate Registration System with GIS will help to locate the
exact location of property particularly in Butuan City. The system is the

response to the problem faced in some real estate management companies

without Geographic Information System.

","1.1 Project Context

Real Estate Registration System are systems that keep track of
properties that are available for sale. Using these systems, the information the
property can be viewed online without the need to visit the actual site. It also
provides a system administrator to keep records of the transactions involved
in selling the property.

Real Estate is the way of buying and selling valuable properties like
house and lots. It involves: identifying clients, conducting research to identify
real estate needs, arranging meetings with prospective clients, providing
analytical support for cash flow and other financial analyses as well as
gathering market data. Letters of intent proposing business terms to
prospecting clients help build strong client relationships by delivering best,
high class, quality service which includes providing relevant information to

clients on timely basis. Planning and communicating become easier now with
the use of technology. Geographic Information System (GIS) is one of the
innovations making it easy to locate a particular site in Google Map or any

properties related to the position on earth’s surface.

Geographic information system (GIS) is a computer system for storing,

checking and displaying data about specific position or location on the earth’s
surface. GIS can show data in one map to help people analyze, compare and

differentiate the relationship of things in the earth’s terrain. It also includes

locations such as farms, housing and other relevant establishments. Much
different information may be compared and contrasted using GIS. For
example, a GlS-generated map could include sites that produce high market
value of properties. Earlier technologies only rely on Google Map to locate a
certain property on the earth’s surface. This poses a problem especially when
uploading and capturing data on one map. Existing real estate registration
systems without GIS still have some flaws. Some of these systems provide
locations using Google maps, as can be seen at www.propertyfinderph.com.
Though these provide the location of the properties, they cannot provide the
exact coordinates and measurements of the properties. Other systems, like
www.property24.com.ph only provide Google Maps. These maps do not even
provide markers to pinpoint the exact location of the real property. They do
not utilize GIS to present the exact location of a particular area. The existing
real estate registration systems still utilize the traditional search bar.
Searching for properties involves typing on a search bar. With the use of the
traditional search bar, results are displayed as images that fits as to what is
being searched. For Real Estate buyers, searching for the availability of
properties in certain areas is difficult. It is also virtually impossible to subdivide
land having exact measurements without visiting it physically.
These problems are addressed in the proposed Real Estate
Registration System. Using the data gathered from the local City Assessor's
Office, the area of the involved properties can be plotted on the map,

pinpointing its exact location. Using this method, the exact shape and
measurements of an identified property can be visualized by just looking at a
map. The proposed system will also feature a map-based search where
viewers can browse and filter the properties displayed on the map. By utilizing
the data obtained from local government agencies and GIS software, the
system will be able to provide suggestions on how to subdivide real properties

in cases where the property for sale is only a part of a much bigger property

or land.

1.1 Introduction

According to Salen & Zimmerman (2003), “A game is a system in
which players engage in an artificial conflict, defined by rules that result in a
quantifiable outcome.” The game is known to be a mental and physical
enhancer to every player. It is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for
enjoyment. It generally involves mental or physical stimulation, and often both.
Many games such as strategy, puzzle, and simulation help develop practical
skills, serve as a form of exercise. The game varies nowadays. The famous

ones are the mobile and computer games.

According to the survey conducted by the researchers to the five (5)
professionals, five (5) students of ACLC of Butuan, five (5) civilians, and five
(5) players, a total of twenty (20) populations, games nowadays are inclined to
be entertaining which provides amusement to the players. More often than not
most of it doesn’t provide any educational values to the players— a problem in
which according to our survey that we have conducted that most of the games
they have played gave them bad effects. Aside from that, the proponents also
asked if educational games are dominant in society nowadays, all of them
answered that there are more non-educational games that exist nowadays.
There are some educational games that exist on the internet, but nonetheless,

there are few educational games that promote a place, city or even region.
As a result, the proponents proposed an educational game namely KNOW

CARAGA.

Know CARAGA is an educational game that will help promote the
region CARAGA and at the same time help educates the players about the
history and the beauty of the region. It also focused on how to boost the
players and students’ motivation to learn, as well as their interest in the

would be of great help to the Bureau of Fire Protection Officers. It eliminates the
burden of misunderstanding the location of the nearest hydrant in the incidents,
aside from it being time consuming. More importantly, to distinguished and

Introduction

Conventional fire hydrants are generally quite robust and reliable units.
They are relatively simple devices that provides the required reliability. After all,
itis absolutely critical that a fire hydrant be capable of operating as required upon
demand, as an alternative is the potential for major property destruction, and
perhaps serious injury and loss of life (Wasmeyahh M. A. S. Al Azemi, 2013).
This invention relates to a hydrant locator that facilitates the location of a hydrant
by firefighters, particularly in an emergency. The low profile device wraps around
the hydrant cylinder for mounting purposes and a switch in an emergency vehicle
sets off strobe lights on the device upon activation to alert firefighters to the
hydrant location. In fighting fires, time is a crucial factor and precious time is
often wasted searching for a fire hydrant. Ideally, firefighters want to hook up to

the nearest hydrant for purposes of water pressure and running less hose.

This invention comprises a hydrant locator which is low profile and wraps
around the cylinder of the hydrant but does not interfere with discharges from the
hydrant. The locator device comprises a plurality of solar powered strobe lights
that are strapped about the hydrant alternating with solar panels. A locked latch
secures the locator belt of strobe lights and solar panels to the hydrant. A
shatterproof shield is mounted over the strobe lights and solar panels. A receiver
is also mounted within the locator to activate the strobe lights upon receipt of a
remote signal. In use, a remote switch located in an emergency vehicle is

coupled to a transmitter to send a signal to the receiver activating only those
hydrant locators within a given range of approximately 1500 feet. Further the
switch can activate a different colour strobe light to indicate the closeness of the
hydrant. Accordingly, an object of this invention is to provide a new and improved
hydrant locator according to Erik Martin (2004). The use of water, by fire brigades
throughout the world, has its roots set deeply in history. The provision of that
supply has varied dependent on its availability and industrial and social

development according to Stephen Moore (2003).

Research by Catton (1988) and Fowler (2001) has indicated that the
quantity of hydrants installed and the cost of maintenance and testing have led
brigades to consider if they are responsible for too many hydrants. The present
invention is a fire hydrant accessory which provides remote signalling to a central
location, such as a water treatment plant system control and data acquisition
control room, of a sensed parameter at a fire hydrant location. The sensed
parameter can be any one or more of detection of tampering of fire hydrant, water
pressure, temperature of the water flowing through the hydrant, temperature of
the ambient air surrounding the hydrant, etc. Uniquely, the remote signal from a
fire hydrant carries a discrete fire hydrant identification or location indicator which
can be correlated to the specific location or street address dispatch of emergency
response equipment and personnel, to the fire hydrant for repair, etc. (Zoratti,
M.2004). Another invention called fire hydrant locating system includes a fire
hydrant locator that facilitates the location of a hydrant by firefighting, particularly
in an emergency vehicle such as fire engine. The hydrant locator as secured to
the hydrant cylinder has a low profile. The hydrant locating system includes a
transmitter adapter to be located in the emergency vehicle. Upon actuation of a

switch in the transmitter in the emergency a receiver-signal generator in the
3

hydrant locator will be activated to set off strobe lights to alert firefighters of the

hydrant locator (Bilbery R., et. Al 2007).

The current traditional system of paper documents adopted by Fire
Department had led to the inability of the fire fighters to locate usable and
functioning hydrants in an efficient and effective manner which can jeopardize
any rescue mission. Hence, there is a need to revised the Fire Department
current system and develop a new system that is much more easier, portable
and also time and cost effective in locating the fire hydrants. There are two main
functions of this system which are to locate, view and map fire hydrants and its
related information to assist fire fighters during inspection, maintenances and
emergency cases and to display fire hydrants information to public to facilitates
them in identifying the location and codes of the hydrants that are found to be in
poor condition and assists them to inform Fire Department through

“TemanPiliBomba’ application. (Muhamad Syahir Shadin, 201 5).

Nowadays, people use Artificial Intelligence (Al) as a tool that has an
ability to solve problems and find better solution for a certain task. According to
Engelmore, Robert “an expert system is an Artificial Intelligence (Al) tool that is
derived from a branch of computer science. Al's scientific goal is to understand
intelligence by building computer programs that exhibit intelligent behavior.”
Technologies are affecting on how human live, work and entertain, Al is a
product of technology that is popular in terms of business industry such as Al
machines and it improves every day. Al and machine learning will be at the
center of initiatives to modernize agency systems and business processes,

driving the need to break down data silos. (Billy Sokol, 2017)

For thousands of years, herbalism for skin disorders has been used and those
medicinal plants are an important part of our natural wealth. According to the
World Health Organization (WHO), “traditional herbal medicine is naturally
occurring, plant-derived substances with minimal or no industrial processing
that have been used to treat illness within local or regional healing practices.”
Hence, herbal plants are an advantage when it comes to curing certain

diseases as for the purpose of sustaining and maintaining good health. Herbal
plants are affordable and it does not contain any drug that has an adverse

effect.

The Health centers manually diagnose skin diseases that makes the
process of diagnosing slow. Health Center representative recommends the
patients to a dermatologist. Skin diseases specialist is a dermatologist that’s
costly and it takes time to set up a schedule for treatment. Immediate remedies
are needed to temporarily medicate the skin diseases; light skin allergies need
to be treated using herbal medicine. Some herbal plants are unusual and hard

to find and the instruction of using the herbal is necessary.

The solution of the stated problem is, to develop an application which is
the herbal plant expert system capable of diagnosing skin diseases of the
human body. The application will help the user identify specific common skin
diseases, in order to have the prescribe appropriate treatment that doesn't
require going to a dermatologist, it can easily recommend herbal medications,
gives an instruction on how to use the herbal and locate some herbal remedies

INTRODUCTION

4.1. Introduction

Technological change and innovation are acknowledged almost
universally as determinants of globalization (Narula, R. (2014)). The
number of people using android device is increasing since 2016. Games
are the biggest contributor to Google Play’s revenue. History is the
backbone of every city, a memory that needs to be preserved. In this
millennial era, combining history with technological advancement is
possible. This study will promote the City of Butuan using an android-
based mobile game entitled, “The Legend of Butuan: The Masao Warrior.”

2016 recap: 90% of Google Play’s revenue came from games (Hindy,
J. (2017)). The advent of these games had made its way to educational
institution. The researchers used mobile games in a variety of learning
environments to synthesize current literature about the impact of the use
of mobile games on student achievement and attitudes towards learning
(Koutromanos, G., & Avraamidou, L. (2014)). Learning by playing concept
is valid for history museums and cultural centers on the terms of Cultural
Heritage (Perez-Valle A., et al (2014, November)). It is expected that
game-play will trigger a desire to learn more about ancient history and to

make archaeological visits more effective and exciting (Ardito, C., et al.

(2007, April).
Butuan City does not use all the effective media yet, to promote the
vicinity. People plan for and worry about the future, making them too busy
to neither worry about what has been nor visit and roam Butuan City in
order to further study its history. Studying history in this generation ends
up boring and distaste of the topic that they think it is uninteresting. They
prefer playing games rather than learning about history. These games
usually do not prioritize valuable lessons in regards to history integration.

No matter how busy a person gets, he would find a way to unwind and
cool things up in an easiest manner possible. Using the advanced
technology, proponents developed an android mobile game that involves
real-life historical event mixed with fictional elements to spice things up. It
featured the City of Butuan with its history and landmarks. This mobile
game will make it possible for them to be entertained and make Butuan
City accessible in a way. While players are enjoying, they would learn
about the historical phenomenon of the city, as well. This will then serve as

This study is about the Solar Powered Automated Drying Rack Using

Raspberry Pi. The study is focused on developing a drying rack prototype that
would automatically hide and unhide due to rain instances. The researchers
anchored the study in Home Automation Systems Theory, thus, the study
provided two interfaces that would enable the users to automatically and
manually control the prototype. The study was conducted for the purpose of
finding a solution to the inconvenience that the raining probability gives
whenever clothes are hanged onto the drying rack in an open area. There is a
possibility that it might get wet if there is an unpredicted rain. Or, simply, no one
is around to take care of the clothes when it rains. The proponents of the study
aimed to develop a solar powered drying rack prototype that would
automatically and manually hide and unhide due to rainfall detection and
weather forecast from the internet. The newly developed system must be
evaluated in terms of functionality, reliability, efficiency and usability. By utilizing
the Waterfall Development Model Methodology, the prototype was improved,
developed and implemented into a hardware product that would benefit people
of different walks of life in a community who are too occupied to monitor their
clothes in the drying rack. In addition, it can be an efficient solution to the
inconvenience since the prototype is solar powered, hence, weather monitoring
and controlling of the drying rack can be carried out at any time of the day
without worrying about power interruption. The prototype used relevant
technologies such as Raspberry Pi 3, Rain Sensor Module and Servo Motor for
rainfall detection and mechanical control of the drying rack. In addition, the
prototype integrated mobile application to remotely control the drying rack. The
study has reached its purpose in developing a solar powered automated drying
rack prototype using raspberry pi. The researchers concluded that the
developed system is acceptable in accordance to the ISO/IEC 9126-1 Quality
Standard Model.

1.1 Introduction

At present time, people have adapted to technological innovations in
carrying out their chores. The daily heavy workload and routines make it difficult
for people to manage their time (Rammohan et al., 2018). With existing and
evolving technologies nowadays, from machines to appliances and to
smartphones, people have resorted to conduct daily chores smartly and
electronically. These solutions for such tedious tasks make people of different
roles in the community comfortable and make them able to maximize their time.
Similarly, this study aims to provide solution to a certain task.

In the context of weather, it is impossible for it to be controlled. With this
facet condition, hanging washed clothes in the drying rack at open area would
be a person’s burden of raining probability (Rammohan et al., 2018). To ensure

the clothes in the drying rack from being wet without having to wait until it rains,

automation must be utilized. An automation system consists of a connection

between a hardware and software.

The development of Internet of Things (loT) indicates a change in the
accumulation of data. An increasing proportion of data collected today is
generated by sensors (Jyoti et al., 2016). These data generated from the
sensors are collected by microcontrollers that perform a wide variety of tasks.
The performance growth of microcontrollers has led their ability to manage

complex application. At the same time, there is a variety of manufacturers of

j mance.
microcontrollers with many diverse types of processor and perfor

Raspberry Pi belongs to the most widely used microcontrollers (Martinez,
2016). The Raspberry Pi 3 has been chosen as a microcontroller in order to
gather information from the rain sensor module and mechanically control the
drying rack. A Raspberry Pi is a credit-sized computer that you can use to
program practical projects. The Raspberry Pi is mainly utilized due to its low
cost and small size and its performance is almost comparable to a normal
computer.

Thus, a microcontroller, rain sensor module, a mechanical motor and
solar power source is relevant for the development of the Solar Powered
Automated Drying Rack. A prototype that mechanically hides and un-hides the
drying rack in every rainfall detection. The rain sensor module provides the
parameter that the study is concerned about. Hence, the study aimed to provide
a solution to the problem concerning rain probabilities whenever there are

clothes hanged in the drying rack.

"MITIGATING VULNERABILITIES THROUGH ALCOHOL DETECTOR WITH
ENGINE IGNITION STOPPER (ADWEIS) FOR MOTORCYCLES
","ABSTRACT

The Internet of Things (loT) has caught the attention of the big sectors
of the society in the fields of business, industry, and academy. Technically,
the Internet of Things (loT) is responsible for technologically enhancing day to
day activities, the creation of various products and services in business, and
as an inclusive source of research ideas and topics. Due to ever-growing
populations, the number of vehicles in a city also increases resulting in the
rise of the number of road accidents discovered. The Butuan City Police
Station 1 had a tally of 177 motorcycle accidents from 2016 to the month of
April of this year, 62 or 35% of these are reportedly alcohol-related. More than
9% of motorcycle accidents per year in Butuan City is alcohol-related. By this
reason, the proponents conducted the study entitled Mitigating Vulnerabilities
through Alcohol Detector with Engine Ignition Stopper (ADWEIS) for
Motorcycles. The objective of the study is to develop a device that will be
embedded to the motorcycle and helmet. The proponents decided to develop
a prototype to mimic the functionalities of a motorcycle, an important function
of the prototype is to detect alcohol level, this is made possible by the help of
the MQ3 Alcohol sensor. After blowing to the device for the five-second
countdown, the device will then process if the breath contains alcohol gas. If
the sensor detects 0.08% of blood alcohol content, the device will initiate a
buzzer notification and will cause a stoppage to the ignition of the engine.
Another module is the helmet that will send an SMS notification to the
indicated number if alcohol presence is detected. The proponents decided to
use the Rapid Application Development model which involves fast phase
development with iterative processes. The proponents also used Survey
Questionnaire as a tool for data gathering. The proponents provided 20
questionnaires in relation to the ISO-9126-1 Software Quality Characteristics
to determine overall quality of the prototype. The survey resulted with a mean
of 4.6 on the overall quality stating that the prototype is Acceptable.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the study

The Internet of Things (loT) has been one of the innovative technologies
that helped shape the modern world. It is one of the booming technologies for
the past decades (Alkhatib, Bosua, Buchanan, Waycott, 201 8).It has caught the
attention of the big sectors of the society in the fields of business, industry, and
academy. Technically, the Internet of Things (loT) is responsible for
technologically enhancing day to day activities, the creation of various products
and services in business, and as an inclusive source of research ideas and
topics. Various institutions, enterprises, and government agencies have
recognized its importance and potential benefits that can be acquired in multiple
fields in the society and has driven them to conduct strategic programs and
profitable projects.

Moreover, the Internet of Things-enabled Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) has gained the reputation of being a solution for enhancing road
safety in smart cities. Due to ever-growing populations, the increasing number
of vehicles in a city willl also results in the rise of the road accidents discovered.
The project aimed at embedding vehicles with a plethora of sensors to monitor
the current situation of the vehicle, it’s surroundings and facilitates the detection
of vehicle-related incidents (Bhatti, et al, 2019).

Butuan City is no stranger with vehicular accidents, due to the ever-
increasing number of accidents in the city, a solution to this manner expected
to be utilized with the Internet of Things-enabled Intelligent Transportation

Systems (ITS). However, the city has not yet aimed at achieving “smartness”
or by improving the technology-based projects, specifically on vehicle-related
fields. Resulting in the ineffectiveness of the Internet of Things-enabled

Intelligent Transportation (ITS) on less advanced cities. With this on-going

problem, an effective solution should be conducted.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study
Mobile games have been developed to be probably the largest

area within the software development industry (Hatridge, 2016). Extensive
use of mobile Phones will Provide the advantage of developing games
running on an android device. History provides a sense of context to our
lives and helps us to understand the way things might approach the future.
The study of history is sometimes classified as part of the humanities and
at other times as part of the social sciences. Playing mobile games
throughout learning of history can encourage people to play android games
and may give an interest in the software development industry.

Mobile games are emerging with an enormously competitive
industry and many video games are produced daily in the previous two
years (Su, 2016). Android applications are one of the most significant
innovations in the mobile industry and in the year 2016, 90% of Google Play
income originated from games (Hindy, 2017). Historical games, like many
historical movies, are brimming with precision, primarily to improve the story
in the medium and make it additionally engaging (Mclaughlin, 2015).
Incorporating history into a game requires sufficient time to research at least
some of the key facts straight. A mobile game that is blended in with history

and entertainment has additionally carried new enthusiasm to retro games

(D'Argenio, 2019).
In the i
he Study of history, effective strategies are lacking for students
to improve i i
their learning process in history, some students may find the

_ Study of hi
: Story not interesting (Tok, 2016). They would rather hold their

mobile phones and play video games than reading books and gain some
& knowledge of history. Usually in video games, the goal is to entertain people
_ and not prioritize giving facts about the player's history. In mobile games,
players spend long hours playing games which will result in much less time
spent studying their lessons.

A history-based game will be a bridge for the players to know
about history of a place while playing. Playing history-based games on
mobile devices might change the player's perspective in learning about

history. The study is not only to entertain but also it helps the users to gain

knowledge about the story of Rajah Qi-ling during his era.

"A SYSTEM FOR GROUND SHAKING DETECTION & EMBEDMENT OF
DYNAMIC SAFETY MECHANISM IN BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURES
","ABSTRACT

Ground shaking is one of the effects of an earthquake. This describes
the vibration of the ground during an earthquake which is an unpredictable
phenomenon. The Philippines is vulnerable to calamities because it is part of
the pacific ring of fire and most of our resources for calamity preparation are
not much on earthquake events. The shaking and moving of the ground from
earthquakes are not predictable, but it can be measured. Seismic activity, which
is the shaking of the ground, is measured by seismographs. The proposed work
is to design a system that can detect ground shaking and provide a dynamic
safety mechanism for building infrastructures. The system will estimate the local
seismic intensity of the ground shaking at the particular location of the
instrument. To determine the magnitude of the shaking the researchers used
the ADXL335 three-axis accelerometer. This sensor can measure the static
acceleration of gravity in tilt-sensing applications, as well as dynamic
acceleration resulting from motion, shock, or vibration and use Arduino UNO as
its main controller. It is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-
use hardware and software and applies the 3-dimensional vector formula to get
the seismograph reading of the shaking. It also applies the Richter scale
formula to calculate the approximate magnitude. The system provides an alarm
signal and safety mechanisms to a building like automatically opening doors
and activating guiding lights. Those dynamic safety mechanisms will trigger the
approximated threshold. Optimistically, the system should help to reduce the
number of injuries and casualties due to its capabilities during a ground-shaking

situation.

","INTRODUCTION

4.1 Rationale of the Study

The geographical location of the Philippines in the Pacific makes the
country highly susceptible to natural hazards such as earthquakes. The country
is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, “an area encircling the Pacific Ocean where
earthquakes and volcanic activity result from the movements of tectonic plates.”
(Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2008). Because man has no control
over earthquakes, they must be considered it as unavoidable events
(International Civil Defense Organization [ICDO], n.d.). According to the book,
“Living on an Active Earth: Perspectives on Earthquake Science” that the
preparation and rapid emergency response are therefore the bulwarks of a
good seismic defense (National Research Council, 2003).

Butuan City Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council (BCDRRMC)
stated that most of the resources of the DRRM is focused on mitigating flooding
but not much on earthquake preparedness. At present, the preparedness plan
initiated for earthquake events is training for Basic Life Support and Fire Drill.
The government's response to disaster is focused on mostly emergency relief
measures. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology
(PHIVOLCS) mandates services for a warning, disaster preparedness, and
mitigation, but they only provide a wide scale of information. So, in that matter,
having the idea of adding technical measures, the proponents realize how
beneficial a system to a building that can detect an approximate level of ground

shaking and can provide dynamic safety mechanisms.

By considering the Philippines ' geographical location and by conducting
research and studies in some residents in Butuan City, the proponents intend

to develop a system which can be used and beneficial to buildings and houses
in Butuan, which lead them to create a System for Ground Shaking Detection

& Embedment of Dynamic Safety Mechanism in Building Infrastructures.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

Money derives its value by being a medium of exchange, a unit of
measurement and a storehouse for wealth. Payments, salaries and any kind of
business can be involved monetary aspect. According to Campello et.al (2004)
Cash is essential in any kind of payment transaction because it is convenient
and hustle free. According to Reimers et.al (2014) Despite an increasingly
convenience-oriented society, very few empirical studies have identified
convenience as a salient determinant of store patronage. Convenient stores,
retail stores, and public markets are likewise known to be in need of more cash
especially coins. Coin is a small, flat, (usually, depending on the country or
value) round piece of metal or plastic used primarily as a medium of exchange
or legal tender. Coins are made of valuable metal that are stored in large

quantities as bullion coins. Other coins are used as money in everyday

transactions, circulating alongside banknotes.

According to Anant Vijay Kala (Anant Vijay Kala, 2013) If you’ve shopped
in India you likely know the problem. You go to a store to buy a few things and
when it’s time to pay, you hand over the cash. But the cashier's run out of
change. Instead of the few rupees a monetary unit of India, you’re owed, the
cashier gives you one or two candies, or a stick of chewing gum, fo make up
This is also one of the obvious effects of coin shortage here in the
Philippines, it is the policy of some stores to shortchange customers due
primarily to the fact that shops sometimes resulted to using candies as change.
According to Swathi V. (Swathi V., 2014) Availability of small change has
become a big issue for everybody in the city, with gradually increasing

magnitude. While traders and merchant community has always had a problem

with coin change, now the scarcity is affecting even consumers.

According to Joshi et.al (2016) Coin counting machines have yet to be
fully developed, counting and classifying currency coins with accuracy and high
speed is a challenging problem for banks and stores, and even consumers.

People used to count coins manually, this procedure was not only tedious and
time consuming, but also prone to mistakes.

To ease the issues and problems face on a certain need of the coin, the
researcher proposes a machine that capable of identifying and changing 1000,
500, 200, 100, 50, and 20peso bill to 1, 5, and 10peso coin. A machine is

capable of checking the authenticity of bill and have a free will to choose the

combined coin on exchange.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

In most cities of the country, there are stray dogs in every area. The
cause of these are owners who are just letting them roam free. These strays
can thrive as long as the conditions are met, which are food from garbage and
the abundance of a mate through other strays. This activity can lead to an
exponential growth of the stray dog population. Unvaccinated dogs may lead
to problems if left unchecked, such as the rapid spread of rabies accidents,

which is mostly caused by stray's aggressive behavior towards the populace.

According to.

Republic Act (RA) 9482, known as the Anti-Rabies Act of 2007, the law
also states that a stray dog can be impounded if it is found that it has no
owner for the safety of bystanders. This law was made in line with the policy

of the State to establish responsible pet ownership.

With regards to making sure that dog owners will be responsible for
their pets at the same time, RA 9482 states that both the dog owner and even
the local government units had been mandated to be responsible for caring
for dogs. According to Section 5 (c) of this law, to avoid accidents from
happening, it is the responsibility of the pet owners to maintain control over

their dogs and not to allow them to roam the streets or any public place

without a leash.

While local government units (LGUs) are responsible for making sure

that dogs are leashed or confined within the premises of a dog owner's house
or fenced surroundings(Section 7,(3), Ibid.), the LGUs were strictly

responsible for enforcing dog impounding and field control of controlling stray

INTRODUCTION

4.1 Rationale of the Study

In most of healthcare industries, physical monitoring has been employed. The
front liners needs to physically observe the condition of the patient, this
activity is time consuming and it lacks of social distancing and everyday
preventive actions. In June 20, 2020 the Department of Health (DOH) 13
(Caraga) has confirmed local transmission of the coronavirus disease 2019

on local government units (LGUs) to strictly implement the health protocols to
contain the spread of Covid-19. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases
admitted in hospitals is continuously increasing in the Philippines. Front liners
health care workers are faced with imminent risks of being infected. In terms
of monitoring the patient Robots have replaced humans in performing

1.1 Rationale of the Study
Most of aquaculture industries, manual water monitoring has been
employed, the aquaculture farms normally perform their daily physical
monitoring on fishponds. The fisherman needs to manually observe the water
condition of the fishpond, this activity is time consuming and it lacks automated
alert system for the fisherman. Agusan River Basin was in the northeastern part
of Mindanao that passes mainly through three Provinces in Region XI and
Caraga. When the rainy season comes, Agusan River would be filled with water
and would overflow in which it can affect their fishponds in Agusan del Norte.
According to Escobido J. et al. (2019, September 15) the fisher folks of Agusan
del Norte can predict the water level of Agusan del Norte, by means of the
predictions of high tide, low tide of the calendar, however, in terms of monitoring
the water level on their prediction is not always accurate because when there
is a heavy rain the water level arises and cause overflowing and bursting to
open dike of the fishponds. Also, fisher folks manually check the water quality
of the fishpond and can’t assure that the water is not polluted because when
there is a heavy rain the water from the polluted area will go straight to the
fishponds and pollutes the area. By then, they will monitor the fishpond water
quality by checking manually the entire fishpond if there are dead fishes or
prawns floating in the said area and lead their conclusion that the water of the
fishpond is polluted. As mentioned by Kayalvizhi et al. (2015), the problem also

related to the requirement of manpower to perform manual activities and need

to be minimized, the Proponents also developed a monitoring system. Based
on this matter, the proponents decided to conduct research and studies which

leads them to create a system for monitoring fishpond with notification

component.

Therefore, the proponents decided to develop a system for monitoring
fish pond with notification component that would frequently monitored in the
water level of the fishpond and give warnings when the water level arises using
different kinds of sensors and to develop a system that store and retrieve data.
If the water level of the fishpond arises to its standard level, the system would
automatically send an SMS to the fisherman containing the water level of the
fishpond, temperature and its pH level. Through this, it would be useful to
observe the water level and monitor water parameters; temperature, pH, and

the water level if it is well-balanced in order to ensure the fish health, growth

and survival.

1.1 Rationale of the Study

Viruses that can cause pandemics are not new in our world. Viruses we
already face before, such as the SARS-CoV pathogen, were responsible for
8,000 cases in 2013, and MERS-CovV pathogen was responsible for 2,494
points in the year 2012 (Li, X., Zai, J., Zhao, Q., YiLi, Q.N., Foley, B.T., Chaillon,
A., 2020). Those viruses are contagious to indirect and direct transmission.
Once the virus contaminated the environment, the person must be careful
because when it touches a contaminated object, hands can then initiate self-
inoculation of mucous membranes of the nose, eyes, or mouth that is the
indirect transmission. Direct transmission happens when a person talks and

touches an infected person.

Some of the protocols and controls include the need for hand hygiene
and personal protective equipment and to minimize self-contamination to
reduce the spread. For protection against inoculation of mucosal surfaces in
the respiratory tract, enhanced surface cleaning and disinfection are common
contro! contributors (Otter, J.A., Donskey, C., Yezli, S., Douthwaite, S.,
Goldenberg, S.D., Weber, D.J., 2016). The syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-

CoV-2) is now tranche called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Nowadays, due to the coronavirus pandemic, people discover many
disinfection and sanitation products in the market, and some local officials are
encouraging the public to use face masks and face shields when going to a

public place or riding a public utility vehicle. Businesses and establishments

","INTRODUCTION
1.1 Project Context

Most of the time, People have money with them. Be it coins or bills,
each of us has it. Some People are into currency collecting, which means that
bills and coins are significant to them. According to Liberty Coin & Currency et
al.(2016), Collecting coins and notes may be the same. But there is a big
difference that is beyond the surface of what it seems. Paper Currencies are
much more convenient to store the coin currency because it occupies less
space and allows one to store more in their money storage. Due to the long
historical existence of coins, the world has a more significant number of them
at its disposal. Paper Currencies have higher face values, and this makes

them more expensive to purchase than coins.

Based on the differences stated, bills and coins each have their pros
and cons. However, in an article by Joanne E. Mcneish et al. (2020), she said

that people like paper bills. Most customers consider paper bills to have more

value, especially for those who do their transactions online; this could mean
’

that people prefer to have their money in the form of a paper bill. But Abigail

Abrams (et al. 2017) stated that paper money could harbor thousands of

microbes from every environment it touches. Hundreds of microorganisms

Species were found living on paper bills. And although plenty was harmless,
there till some species that cause skin infections. Traces of drugs such
are $s
it. Other research has shown that

Pathogens that ca wae:
US Serious illness like E. coli and salmonella are contained

in some bills a : :
Nd coins. This Study has cited some reasons that may cause

people not to want Paper bills as their money.

Many studies try to prove the importance of either coins or bills, so these
forms of money still exist today and are still used by people. Based on the
Studies that the proponents have cited, cash are preferable to coins in storage
efficiency and monetary value. But sometimes, there are instances when we
have too many coins in our pockets that it causes us inconvenience, maybe
because it is too heavy or occupies too much space in our bags. However, we
cannot ignore the value of coins because there are situations when urgently
needed, but unfortunately, we don't have them or don't have enough. In small
stores or places like Piso nets or other establishments where coins are

necessary, these situations can be very inconvenient because now you have
'

to find a store to buy something to have your bills changed. Different kinds of

vending machines require coins, like the snack vending machine or the water

vending machine. There are also situations where people have saved money
in their piggy banks and are now filled up, these piggy banks will mostly have
the owners might want to have them

coins in them, and for this reason,

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background of the Study

In the wake of COVID-19, the Commission on Higher Education
(CHED) and the Department of Education (DepEd) deliberately help how
Classes from all levels will be directed by our new normal. Classes with
physical contact are suspended, and private online classes are currently the
methods for educating. Making and observing all the understudies' tests in a
Class is now tiring and tedious for instructors, and still, they need to make their
essential arrangements for educating the students. The advocates inferred
that the basic issue in online classes besides the web, accessibility of
contraptions and the information on utilizing on the web stages is that
instructors make tests and then upload it to the web and monitors all the
students' exams through manual checking in a class and send feedbacks to
the understudies individually.
[tem analysis is a process that looks at student reactions to individual
test items (questions) to survey the nature of those things and the test in
general. It is an important, great strategy accessible to showing experts and

teachers the direction and improvement of guidelines. This strategy

empowers teachers to expand their test development aptitudes, recognize

explicit territories of the course content which need more noteworthy

accentuation or clarity, and improve other homeroom practice Item analysis

also is a statistical technique which is used for selecting and rejecting items of

the test based on their D.V. and discriminated power. Item analysis is

accomplished for acquiring DV (Difficulty Value) and D.P. (Discriminative
Power). The difficulty value or D.V. of an item is defined as the proportion or
percentage of the examinees who have answered the item correctly.
According to the revelations of the investigation of Sirri and Freddano
(2011), in the standardized and target appraisal of understudy shows, the
thing assessment is a cycle wherein the two understudies’ answers and test
questions are investigated to review the quality and measure of the things and
the test generally. Khan, Ishrat, and Khan (2015) communicated that item

examination is proposed for students’ arrangement level by surveying the

requests given in evaluation.
According to Asst. Prof. Anabella C. Doctor, /nformation Technology

and Information System Department, Adamson University, Philippines and Dr.
Carmelita H. Benito Information Technology and Information System
Department, Adamson University, Philippines Item Analysis is a factual
method that causes personnel and foundations to assess the quality and wipe
out deceiving test things remembered for a test given and taken by the
understudies.

According to Kennedy Quaigrain and Ato Kwamina Ahren, /tem
analysis is fundamental in improving things, which will utilize it again in later
tests; it can likewise use it to dispose of deluding item in a test The
examination zeroed in on thing and test quality and investigated the
connection between trouble record (p-worth) and segregation list (DI) with
distractor effectiveness (D.E.).

Accordingly, item banking is a very convenient tool for the educational
system to monitor academic achievement. Advanced and sophisticated

computer software further enhances the possibilities towards high calibrated
will be categorized and evaluated according to their difficulty level through
item analysis. Before the test questionnaire moves to the test bank, the
instructor's test will be submitted and assessed by the administrator.

The proponents develop a project entitled ""O-Gen: A Web-Based
Comprehensive Test Creator For All Field Of Study With Item Analysis
Feature"" that instructors can make their questionnaires along with the
appropriate response key, consequently checks the student test/tests with a
tally of every test item in all test types and incorporates test banking.

The system is intended to solve the gap of the existing systems
mentioned above and improve the quality of the items on a test, so educators
can improve the test's general nature, henceforth improving both the
unwavering quality and legitimacy of making such a test. The system to be
created by the defenders needs to utilize PHP as Web interface back-end and
bootstrap, HTML, CSS, java content for the front-end plan, and MYSQL for
the database. Through this, we can diminish the outstanding burden of our
dear instructors in making, checking, and monitoring the tests/quizzes of
students’ inside the class and causes them to embrace and focus on their
teaching and give relevant ideas to the students to improve their studies in
this new sort of learning. To encourage information dividing between the
understudies and improve the educators’ capacities to comprehend the
students’ concem in their assessments and give successful and solid tests for

students.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

Artificial Intelligence is an area of computer science that deals with the
ability to mimic the human brain. Al systems typically demonstrate some
behaviors associated with human intelligence such as planning, learning,
reasoning, problem solving, knowledge representation, perception, motion, and
manipulation. Artificial Intelligence must access its relations, objects,
categories and properties in order to implement the knowledge engine of an
Expert System (Techpedia, 2019).

Chatbot is an automated messaging software which also uses artificial
intelligence (Al) in conversing with people. There are various expert system
and chatbots were created but some of it are not free to access. Users’
messages containing pediatric concerns can be simply recognize through an
expert system chatbot.

Pediatrics is a branch of medicine that involves medical care of infants,
children, and adolescents. Pediatrics treats and diagnoses conditions among

children such as infections and developmental-behavioral disorder (Mandal,
2019).

A pediatric chatbot that uses artificial intelligence in conversing with
people can be useful in this technological era. In order to cater messages from
the users, chatbots are programmed to understand questions, provide answers,

and execute tasks that resembles speaking to a real person (Cooper, 2019).
Parents lack in knowledge on handling pediatric problems which lead
them to having difficulties in dealing their situation. Parent’s availability of tirne
and money lead them on having inconvenience to get an expert to handle their
concerns. With these inconvenience and lack of knowledge, they cannot
simply find answers, suggestions and remedies with regards to handling
pediatric concerns.

DrPedia is a Facebook Messenger Chatbot that caters ten pediatric
illnesses. Users can now send their pediatric problems through DrPedia.
DrPedia will process their concerns with the use of Backward Chaining and
Deep Learning Algorithm to cater users messages. Users can receive
Suggestions and recommendations based on the matter that they relay to
DrPedia. DrPedia is free to access due to the availability and accessibility of

","ABSTRACT

The Internet of Things (loT) has caught the attention of the big sectors
of the society in the fields of business, industry, and academy. Technically,
the Internet of Things (loT) is responsible for technologically enhancing day to
day activities, the creation of various products and services in business, and
as an inclusive source of research ideas and topics. Due to ever-growing
populations, the number of vehicles in a city also increases resulting in the
rise of the number of road accidents discovered. The Butuan City Police
Station 1 had a tally of 177 motorcycle accidents from 2016 to the month of
April of this year, 62 or 35% of these are reportedly alcohol-related. More than
9% of motorcycle accidents per year in Butuan City is alcohol-related. By this
reason, the proponents conducted the study entitled Mitigating Vulnerabilities
through Alcohol Detector with Engine Ignition Stopper (ADWEIS) for
Motorcycles. The objective of the study is to develop a device that will be
embedded to the motorcycle and helmet. The proponents decided to develop
a prototype to mimic the functionalities of a motorcycle, an important function
of the prototype is to detect alcohol level, this is made possible by the help of
the MQ3 Alcohol sensor. After blowing to the device for the five-second
countdown, the device will then process if the breath contains alcohol gas. If
the sensor detects 0.08% of blood alcohol content, the device will initiate a
buzzer notification and will cause a stoppage to the ignition of the engine.

Another module is the helmet that will send an SMS notification to the
indicated number if alcohol presence is detected. The proponents decided to
use the Rapid Application Development model which involves fast phase
development with iterative processes. The proponents also used Survey
- Questionnaire as a tool for data gathering. The proponents provided 20

- questionnaires in relation to the ISO-9126-1 Software Quality Characteristics
to determine overall quality of the prototype. The survey resulted with a mean
of 4.6 on the overall quality stating that the prototype is Acceptable.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the study
The Internet of Things (loT) has been one of the innovative technologies

that helped shape the modern world. It is one of the booming technologies for
the past decades (Alkhatib, Bosua, Buchanan, Waycott, 201 8).It has caught the
attention of the big sectors of the society in the fields of business, industry, and
academy. Technically, the Internet of Things (loT) is responsible for
technologically enhancing day to day activities, the creation of various products
and services in business, and as an inclusive source of research ideas and
topics. Various institutions, enterprises, and government agencies have
recognized its importance and potential benefits that can be acauired in multiple
fields in the society and has driven them to conduct strategic programs and
profitable projects.

Moreover, the Internet of Things-enabled Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) has gained the reputation of being a solution for enhancing road
safety in smart cities. Due to ever-growing populations, the increasing number
of vehicles in a city willl also results in the rise of the road accidents discovered.
The project aimed at embedding vehicles with a plethora of sensors to monitor
the current situation of the vehicle, it’s surroundings and facilitates the detection
of vehicle-related incidents (Bhatti, et al, 2019).

Butuan City is no stranger with vehicular accidents, due to the ever-
increasing number of accidents in the city, a solution to this manner expected
to be utilized with the Internet of Things-enabled Intelligent Transportation

Systems (ITS). However, the city has not yet aimed at achieving “smartness”
2

or by improving the technology-based projects, specifically on vehicle-related
fields. Resulting in the ineffectiveness of the Internet of Things-enabied

Intelligent Transportation (ITS) on less advanced cities. With this on-going

problem, an effective solution should be conducted.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

The World Health Organization (WHO) defined health as a state of
complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the
absence of disease or infirmity (Kuhn, S. & Rieger, U.M., 2017). The
positive concept emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as
physical capacities (Haslam, S. A., & Reynolds, K. J., 2003). This means
that health is a resource to support an individual's function in wider
society (Sharma, M., 2016). A healthful lifestyle that provides the means
to lead a full life (Nordqvist, 2017). More recently, researchers have
defined health as the ability of a body to adapt to new threats and
infirmities (Bhattacharya, N., 2019). They based this the idea on the
modem science that it has dramatically increased human awareness of
diseases and how they work in the last few decades (Nordqvist, 2017).
One of the problems in health is monitoring blood pressure or
hypertension (Barnett, G. O., Winickoff, R. N., Morgan, M. M., & Zielstoff,
R. D., 1983). Blood pressure composed of two types such as systolic
pressure and diastolic pressure (Stamler, J., Stamler, R., & Neaton, J. D.,
1993). The systolic pressure is the force at which the heart pumps blood
around the body. While the diastolic pressure is the resistance of the
blood flow in the blood vessels (Illiades, 2009). A blood pressure reading

between 120/80mmhg and 140/90mmhg could mean you're at risk of
The factors of having a blood pressure includes at the age of 65, being
overweight, have a family of high blood pressure, don’t do enough
exercise, drink too much alcohol or coffee, smoking, and don’t get much
sleep or have disturbed sleep (Monk, 2019). According to Food Nutrition
Research Institute(FNRI), the National prevalence of hypertension among
Filipino adults is 20 years old and over had significantly increased after a
decline in 2013 from 22.3% to 23.9% in 2015 (Aurel, 2018). The
Department of Health (DOH) also revealed that hypertension remains to
be a leading cause of illness and said to be one of the identified
precipitating factors of premature death in the Philippines (Flores, 2018).
In 2017, DOH conducted a current national survey that the total number
of hypertensive Filipinos is more than 12 million with more than half of
them are unaware of their condition and one out of four to five Filipinos in
general (Orillo, 2018). Hypertension is also one of the top causes of
premature deaths worldwide and the problem is growing (Eriksson, H.,
1995). In 2025, the World Health Organization warned that an estimated
1.56 billion adults will be living with hypertension (Agdeppa, 2016). The
traditional way of checking blood pressure is that the doctors use a
Sphygmomanometer to take systolic and diastolic measurement, the

phases when the heart pumps blood and then rest (Ormon Healthcare,
2018),
The proponents proposed a system wearable blood pressure
monitoring system using Arduino in generating status report through web
portal access. To be able to monitor and know the patient's status of their
blood pressure and in addition, is to keep them updated to their condition
every day. The user cannot get any hustle when they go outside of their
house since they can wear the device wherever they will go. The relatives
can monitor their patient even the patient is not in their house. Also by the
use of the system, it tracks the current location of the user through global

positioning system or GPS. The primary goal of this study as well is to

communicate information clearly through the use of information applies.

INTRODUCTION

1.1. Rationale of the Study

In the present day the population exposure to heat is increasing due to
climate change, global temperature and the frequency and intensity of
heatwaves will rise in the 21° century as a result of climate change according
to an article of the World Health Organization article on Climate change and

human health. When talking about heat and the impact it inflicts on a person’s
health there are several illnesses. In prolonged or intense exposure to hot
temperatures can cause heat exhaustion, heat cramps, some minor skin
damage which may lead to more severe cases yet one thing in particular is
heat stroke. According to a study in Harvard Medical School on the subject
heat stroke it is when the body temperature reaches 105 degrees Fahrenheit
or 40 degrees Celsius or higher and the body is not able to cooldown as heat
is accumulating in the body, this cause heat stroke if not treated and given
first aid this can be life threatening. In an article published by study.com the
statistics on the reported cases of deaths due to heat stroke is over 9,000
documented heat stroke deaths occurred between 1979 and 2013, and is
believed to be higher, but certain deaths were not documented as being
caused by heat stroke on death certificates, in a report dated 18"" of March
2018 by Philstar Global in manila two were found dead on separate days and

time according to the police autopsy report police investigators said the two

victims died of heat stroke, on the 11"" March 2019 Department of Health
wars the public on the dangers of heat stroke, with this warning people are

informed that possible heat spike may occur on the proceeding months.

In the Philippines whereas temperature vary due to unstable climate
conditions because of being in a tropical area. The hottest temperature
recorded and stated by Wikipedia is 42.2 degrees Celsius in Tuguegarao,
Cagayan valley dated on 12"" of April 1912, and 11"" of May 1969. In a report
of CNN Philippines, Metro Manila was recorded the hottest temperature for
this year dated on 21° of April 2019 Sunday Afternoon at 36.6 degrees
Celsius with this, there was a recorded heat index of 39 degrees Celsius. The
heat index measures the actual temperature felt by people factoring in the
humidity levels in the area. PAGASA use thermometer, Maximum-Minimum
Thermometer and Thermograph to monitor and record changes in the
temperature and humidity for the current day, the gathered data will be
submitted to private sectors that will inform the public on the current weather
forecast having the local news as medium. The Department of Health
conducted seminars and provide health advisory online to inform the public on
how to prevent heat stroke and other heat related illnesses, hence they have
not used any form of device to provide information to the public in real time on
the current heat condition experienced in respective areas therefore the
researchers conducted a study to provide means for the public to receive

information about the current heat wave by detecting the temperature of an

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

Philippines is ranked third in the 2018 World Risk Index of most disaster-
prone countries in the world. The country experiences almost all forms of
disasters such as typhoons, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions with
numerous complex emergencies due to armed conflict (United Nations
Populations Fund Philippines or UNPFA, 2018). When these disasters happen,
residents from the affected areas are relocated to an evacuation center. The
local government then monitors the evacuees to effectively manage and
provide resources for every individual (Allison G. S. Knox, 2016).

On November 8, 2013, over 30,000 people in the Philippines were
affected by typhoon Haiyan also known as super typhoon Yolanda. Putting their
lives to safety has been the main priority of the government during the
catastrophic event (National Disaster Risk Reduction Management statistics,
2014). According to Joseph Marconi C. Agustin, City Social Welfare and
Development Division Head (2019), it is important for them to keep (a) record
of the evacuees to monitor their situation and know the accurate numbers of
household members for them to provide the necessary assistance. Based on
the statement of Barangay Kagawad Juliet D. Conception from barangay Baan
(2019), manual evacuee registration and interview are conducted upon the
arrival. These processes are necessary, not just for monitoring but also to know

if there are missing person in the household. Once a person is confirmed

missing, assigned personnel in the evacuation center will contact the City
Disaster Risk Reduction Management Office or CDRRMO to conduct a search
and rescue operation (Kristin Kay B. Toralba CDRRMO, 2019).

According to Juliet D. Conception from barangay Baan (2019), at
present, the government is still using a paper-based registration system for
evacuee monitoring. In Barangay Baan, Butuan City, the residents need to fill-
up a form that contains personal information and numbers of household
members. However, there are many things that need to be considered when it
comes to the manual registration of evacuees. One of which is the fact that
many people during these moments are still unsettled. A study by Brandon
Brewer (2018) states that, when a person experience disaster, this experience
can lead to trauma and he/she may avoid talking about the event. Another thing
to put in consideration are the children, elderly and the persons with disability.
These old paper-based registration system is cumbersome and error prone that
requires multiple person to person interviews (Mike Geier, 2014).

With the desire of the proponents to improve and help innovate the
current process which is the manual evacuee registration and monitoring, the
proponents intend to develop a system entitled “Evacuee Monitoring System
with Fingerprint Scanner, Facial Recognition and Message Notification Service

using OpenCV and Raspberry Pi”.

prevent the spreading of COVID-19; for this reason, the contact tracing has been
presented using smartphones, Bluetooth connectivity, or GPS location history of
performing the contact tracing. Also, developing a BubbleBox system composed
of a wearable device, a wristband, to Under the protected social gap between ihe
person who wears it and other people, trace all contacts. The wristband is

responsible for outlining the connections- it generates a unique id.
However, The DOH (Department of Health) 13 (CARAGA) has conrmed

local transmission of the coronavirus disease 2019 after reporting new infections

in Butuan City. Due to these developments, Local Government Units (LGUs)

Strictly implement the health protocols to contain the spread of Covid-19. To

reduce the chance of propagation of the 2019-NCOV, the city government of

Butuan has issued a new color-coding scheme to control the movement of

P€ople. The color-coding quarantine pass, residents carrying black colored
quarantine passes can go out only on Monday and Tuesday. Residents with
Blue quarantine passes can Only go out on Tuesday and Friday. At the same
time, those with Red quarantine passes can go out on Wednesday and Saturday
to buy basic needs. Senior citizens, PWD, and pregnant women may go out on
Sunday. Front liners with their quarantine passes are exempted in the
colorcoding scheme. Implementing quarantine passes in a piece of paper is not
enough to control the spreading of coronavirus. Based on this matter, the
proponents decided to conduct research and studies, which leads them to create
a system application for monitoring local residence accessing to establishments
as an aid for contact tracing and data analytics.

Therefore, the proponents decided to develop a system application for
monitoring residents accessing establishments to aid contact tracing and data
analytics to watch those people going inside the shopping malls, barangay, and
any other establishments using IDs that have QR codes. Instead of using a piece
of paper, the old quarantine passes replace an ID with a QR code. Residents will
be trace by those codes and quickly contact those exposed in the area where
there are positive cases. Through this, we can control the people going in and
out in our barangays and city. We know that the COVID-19 pandemic has spread
like wildre across the world. Few countries manage to keep it well-control. To

prevent the spread of virus infections, we will build a system to control its spread.

Introduction

1.1 Rationale of the Study

According to Jurik (2016), logistics has improved and became a
well-developed division that offers continuous process improvement for
companies, communities and supply chain management, and innovation. That
logistics service handles the processes of packaging, shipping, inventory. A
high satisfaction rating is essential to get the loyalty of the customers. At
present, competition against other competitors in e-commerce is very
aggressive. It will do whatever it takes to win and be successful. The companies
will be committed to providing better facilities to cater the customer's demands
and needs and better service than the rest of the competitors. Providing
superior service is an essential and differentiating element, and within the
scope of the business, the delivery of the delivery business is the most
important. (Fereshteh Alizadeh, Minah Lahiji, October 2018). Through the
| development of the internet, e-commerce has boosted significantly and one of
_ the most prominent service offered in the country is food delivery. Food delivery
applications provide the idea of ease and pleasure to young people. Because

of the development of e-commerce, particularly in the food delivery segment, it

i is convenient for those who want Food to get delivered at their doorstep and it

ape has checked that the younger generation brings enjoyment towards ready to

ee : eat Food. (Ms. Ardhana M. Prabhash, February 2020).
With the development of technology and society and the
widespread use and development level of smartphones and the internet, the
purchase approach of a product is no longer restricted to physical stores but of
increasing diversification instead of the specific demands from consumers.
Also, there is a growing trend towards online and sales among many fields not

just in the food industry but also in other business means.

The rapid growth of e-commerce has created new forms of
businesses, such as online to offline (O20), and has alternated the traditional
tasks and jobs. O20 is a marketing method based on information and
communications technology (ICT) in which customers are captivated online and
actuated to complete a transaction in an offline setting. To put it differently, the
customer can place orders of products online, and after the transaction, the
customer will receive the package in an offline manner, such as on time
doorstep of your house, or it could be delivered in your office depending of on

the delivery date and time. Accessibility and the ability to share information

~ quickly have led to mobile commerce’s speedy growth connecting suppliers and

customers via smartphone applications. O20 service have appeared in
different fields, including food delivery services, hotels, real estates, and more.

Real-time connectivity of delivery apps on mobile devices provides

- conveniences such as simplicity, saves time, and offers a wide range of

products and services that sometimes cannot found in a physical store. The

poe is change in how consumers order their products and services daily. One example

of 020 services is Online Ordering System. Online Ordering Systems has
customer after taking the order. With the help of a mobile device, an internet
connection, and GPS, the merchant will track the location of the customer's
device. After the order is processed, the merchant will assign an authorized

courier that will be the one who will deliver the package to the customer with

the use of GPS tracking.

For “e-Hatud: Web Online Ordering and Delivering System with
GPS tracking for independent Merchant in Butuan City” to be developed, the
proponents must know about Online Delivering Systems. The proponents also
must have enough knowledge to understand how the GPS works, and how to
tie in with the system they are trying to make. They must also have enough

experience in developing the project using a programming language of their

choice.

INTRODUCTION

4.1 Project Context

Jobs, whether small or big, are everywhere. Finding the right person for
that specific job is a lot more work than making the actual appointment. And
finding a reliable worker is much more difficult. In this time where everyone

competes for a job, finding a reliable and competent person is a job on its

own.

The proponents propose a mobile application idea that will assist
people in their demand to find a reliable and competent service provider with
technical expertise that ranges from electronic services, menial services,
health and pampering services, and school or study-related services. Through
this application, anyone, granted that they are an expert, can offer assistance
where people can access and view the information on the availability of the

needed services they are looking for it.

The descriptive method of research that will be used in the study are
Surveys and Interviews, which will be conducted to identify the standard
: services needed by the people who will be accessing the benefits that this

application will be providing, the services people want to provide, the time
: they want the service must be provided and other relevant information for

","INTRODUCTION

14.1 Rationale of the Study

Rice production in the Philippines is an essential aspect of the
country's food supply and economy. The Philippines are one of the countries
still using the traditional way of farming. In most of the rice-farming industries,
manual monitoring and watering have been employed. The farmer needs to
monitor the soil's moisture manually, but it's hard for them to monitor the
water's saline level. According to Dr. M.B Sturgis, head, LSU Department of
Agronomy, saltwater can become a problem in rice production, especially in
some areas in dry years. A small amount of saltwater is not dangerous to rice
at any stage of growth. Higher concentrations affect the existing crop and can
cause a build-up of salt in the soil. Rice grown on soils relatively free of salt is
tolerant to salt water with 35 grains (600 parts per million) per gallon of
sodium chloride. This problem encountered the Philippines’ farmers due to
lack of equipment and knowledge about technology, especially those in a

small industry. Water is an essential part of plant growth for about 60%.

Therefore, the soil moisture content (soil moisture) as a medium for
growing plants is essential in agricultural cultivation. The availability of water
becomes the primary determinant in the production of agricultural
commodities. According to Dobermann A, Fairhurst T. 2000 salinity affects the
respiration and photosynthesis of plants. It decreases biological N2 fixation
and soil nitrogen mineralization. Its other effects on rice growth include

reduced germination rate, reduced plant height and tillering low root growth,

and increased spikelet sterility. The problem also related to the requirement of
Pi

human resources to perform manual activities, and during the watering :
~ season, rice fields were manually watered. Again, not all owners can monitor
their crops from time to time. Based on this matter, the proponents decided to
conduct research and studies, which leads them to create a rice field
automation system embedding moisture and salinity detection with notification

and irrigation control facility.

By and large, automating and monitoring rice fields and their status on
their specific identifying elements becomes a necessity. This then leads the
proponents to propose a system that will automate a rice field that embeds its
soil moisture and salinity detection features with notification and irrigation

control mechanism.

1.1 Introduction

In 2019, a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 has been rapidly
spreading and resulted in a respiratory illness known as COVID-19. The
epidemic has spread to over 210 countries, with over 2,400,000 confirmed
cases and over 170,000 deaths. COVID-19 causes severe pneumonia
characterized by fever, cough, and shortness of breath (Am Med, 2020).
According to WHO (World Health Organization), there are no specific
vaccines/treatments for COVID-19 patients. However, there are many process
clinical trials evaluating the possibilities of treatments. Unfortunately, there is
no comprehensive summary of the multiorgan manifestations of COVID-19,
making it difficult for clinicians to educate themselves about this highly

contagious and deadly pathogen quickly.

‘In late February, about 175 executives worldwide come to a

oe : biotechnology company where Biogen's leadership conference is in Boston.

a Over: two days, ie company members shook their hands and talked among

- themselves and then shared meals. Several members at the event were

known infected with the microbe that causes COVID-19, and it quickly
spread among others there, who then brought it home. There are at least 99
people who ended up sick in Massachusetts alone (Aschwanden, 2020). The
outbreak put a lot of pressure on clinical resources and care. Source of
infection, including the patients, asymptomatic carrier, and patients in the

incubation period, are contagious. It is difficult to control the source of infection

(Yang, 2020).

The World Health Organization (WHO) said that the virus could spread
through direct contact within an infected person (generated through coughing
and sneezing). Individuals could also get infected from, and touch surfaces
contaminated with the virus and touch their face (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth). The
government can use many rapid diagnostic and serological tests for the
detection of suspected COVID-19 cases. However, such newly marketed tests'
sensitivity and specificity have not been evaluated and never up to standard
yet (Ahmad Naeem Sajed, Kapil Again, 2020). In the meantime, Strictly

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

Many D Muniti 5
y Deaf communities worldwide face inequalities once it involves

accessing health data and health Care services. Health information and

services are usually not on the market in an accessible format. As a result,
Deaf people often have low health acquisition and are at more significant risk
of being misdiagnosed or not diagnosed within the least. Over the past few
decades, a noteworthy psychological dynamic has arisen. Today, some deaf
constituencies have had a strong reaction to the perception of the deaf as
pathology (Leigh, Andrews, 2017). Particularly inside the past few decades,
proponents of hearing misfortune as a culture have announced that hearing
loss isn't a pathology and thus does not ought to be fixed(Jones M., 2016).
The deaf community isn't a later wonder, neither is it an obsolete conception.
The deaf community is also a time-tested solution that supports deaf people
to live a top of the range life. It's been alive since the primary 1700s were first
established in Europe to rescue deaf people from an educational and non-
secular vacuum. When deaf people began to congregate at these schools, a

replacement community of people was created among those who found that

that they had an analogous orientation towards life - visual direction

(Holcomb, 2020).

- Problems with deat people often begin when making a gathering. Since

: a few GPs exclusively allow arrangements to remodeled the phone, a few of
tikes ie’ met he dito physically get to a particular area to inquire about an

: “assembly. ‘This is inconvenient, but actual educational learning without an
Lal
interpreter might also be somplicated and confusing. Deaf communities
around the world face several similar challenges to autochthonal people
around the world. As indigenous peoples, deaf individuals are usually
politically and socially isolated, have fewer educational and skilled
opportunities, and have restricted access to data and public service (Ketchell,
2019). Ongoing advances in visual, auditory, and neurological technologies
like brain imaging are also profoundly impacted (Leigh, Andrews, 2017). Hard
of hearing individuals have risk factors, just like the deprivation of early
communication and language, which successfully delay cognitive and socio-
emotional growth, often resulting in social isolation, literacy, and emotional
and behavioral problems (Leigh, Andrews, Harris, 2018). These factors
combined with poverty can compound the deaf child's vulnerability for abuse,
neglect, and maltreatment (Lomas, Andrews, Shaw, 2017).

Sign language is that the tongue of prelingually deaf people,
particularly without hearing-speech rehabilitation. Otorhinolaryngologists,
regarding health as complete physical, mental and psychosocial wellbeing,
aim hearing by diagnosing deafness as deviance from normality (Kemaloglu,
Kemaloglu, 2012). Sign dialects are entirely linguistic living dialects with no
vocal component and are irrelevant to the countries’ dominant spoken
languages during which they're used (Oram, Napier, 2019). When hard of
hearing individuals from diverse countries meet, they're able to associate
Straightforwardly by drawing on their existing knowledge of a marked dialect

to smoothly discover a commonality of expression and understanding inside a
; similar vical suntactic structure across different signed languages (Kusters,

Spot, Swanwick, &Tapio, 2017; Zeshan, 2017; Zeshan& Panda, 2018).

INTRODUCTION
The rationale of the study

Waste management is one of the primary problems that the world faces,
irrespective of developing or developed countries. The main issue in waste management
is that the garbage bins at public places get overflowed well in advance before the next
cleaning process's commencement. Problem: The current system for waste management
includes numerous stages with a massive workforce. Every time laborers have to visit the
garbage bins in the city area to check whether they are filled. And if they are filled,
garbage bins are collected and disposed of at the closest landfill. If garbage bins are not
sealed, then the workforce invested goes in vain. A city like Caraga has a population of
1,596,709 (2015), projected to grow more by 2027. And as the population increases, the
waste generated by them will proportionally increase. Currently, about 250 to 460 tonnes

of waste is produced daily in Caraga. (Alden Pantaleon Jr. / MindaNews)

This paper aims to provide an overview of the voluntary approaches towards
enhancing the design of a smart dustbin to implement advanced waste management
systems. In most places, the barangay garbage bins are overflowing, and they are not
cleaned at the proper time. As a result of which the consequences are severe. It includes
overflow of garbage, which results in land pollution, the spread of diseases, and creates
_ unhygienic conditions for people and horror in that place. There needs to system that
gives preliminary information on the bin's filling that alerts the municipality to clean the

os container on time and safeguard the environment. To avoid all such situations, we intend
to propose a solution for this problem, ""Smart Garbage Bin,"" which will alarm and inform
ae the ‘authorized Porson by a buzzer and alert system when the garbage bin is about to fill.

This paper's main objective is to propose a plan to reduce human effort and resources
i es with the enhancement of smart city vision and maintaln a pollution-froe environment

around our homes and especially in public places. (L.A. Guerrero, G Ger, H Willlarn,
""Solid waste management challenges for cities In developing countries,"" Garbage

Management, vol. 33, no. 1, PP. 220-232, January 2013.)

There shall be established a Material Recovery Facility (MRF) in every barangay
or cluster of barangays. The facility shall be installed in a barangay-owned or leased land
or any suitable open space to be determined by the barangay through its Sanggunian.
For this purpose, the barangay or cluster of barangays shall allocate a specific parcel of
land for the MRF. The site's determination and the actual establishment of the facility shall
likewise be subject to the guidelines and criteria set according to this Act. The inhabitants
of barangay face several issues. One of them is domestic solid waste disposal, which
causes pollution; the barangay's waste disposal bins or MRF are shared among all
residents who live in the same barangay, and thus, the bins tend to be filled very quickly.
Therefore, a system of inefficient disposal waste management may cause the containers
to be always full of garbage.

Further littering from the residents will cause the garbage piles to be scattered
outside the bins. Therefore, there will be a sanitary question as those garbage piles may
become the root cause of illness and diseases like dengue, diarrhea, and cholera. An
increase in waste leads to many health problems, and also the gases produced from
wastes lead to air ‘pollution and spreads diseases. (By Sara Mae D. Mawi's -

monitoring trash bins that would frequently monitor the garbage level inside the container
and detect the Hydrogen sulfide gas inside the trash bin with automatic door, and
notification features Using Raspberry pi. The development project can see when the trash
bin is full and detect the hygiene level present inside the trash bin. It monitors the waste
level, and the notifications are sent to the workers through an android app when the

4.1. INTRODUCTION

According to Jennifer Rowley (2005), today’s computerized world,
administrative offices also tend to become paperless offices and with no more
‘piles of files’ scenario. This advancement aids the governing bodies in
disposal of the issues within a reasonable time frame with evasion of
stationery use. File Tracking System is a step in the direction of realizing the
concept of paperless office. The solution is a simulation of physical files into
the electronic form. This enables fast retrieval and makes file movement & file
tracking painless. Longevity of the electronic form solves the problem of

material loss.

In this case, the proponents chose Bureau of Internal Revenue ( BIR)
District office as the setting where we could conduct our study and apply our
system in accordance to its benefits. The proponents had observed that, in
the Bureau of Internal Revenue District office, many taxpayers spent longer
time just to finish processing the requirements needed for their businesses.
The proponents observed that a day is not enough to finish the requirement

that’s why people are constrained just to finish their requirements.
The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) File Tracking System is a web

application that manages all the files’ movement at any time for one
desk/room to another one and helps in managing the flow of files efficiently.
Any desk/room can receive and send request and decisions at any time. The
system follows a procedure of file unique numbering, file status monitoring,
file movement tracking and etc. It also has a very powerful search from to
locate a file and analysed the history of movement of that file. The proposed

system is also an android application for taxpayers viewing purposes.

The proponents proposed Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) File
Tracking System covers different business transaction examples like
registering of business, taxpayer identification, taxpayer and business taxable
and its process. The proposed system concentrates only to track the papers’
movement. Instead of waiting in the office just to process their papers, they
can leave their papers and continue the transaction without waiting. The
taxpayers can update their papers by viewing using an android application to
avoid queuing just to ask the updates of their papers. Bureau of Internal
Revenue file tracking system it is a system made to ease the waiting process
to clients and to avoid the office to become always crowded. To avoid paper
lost and easy to search data, the proponents made this system which primary

"Speech and Text Recognition Mobile App for Hearing-Impaired Person
","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The research in speech recognition has been intensively carried out
worldwide, spurred on by advances in signal processing, algorithms, architectures,
and hardware. Speech and text recognition systems have been developed for a wide
variety of applications, ranging from small vocabulary keyword recognition over dial-
up telephone lines, to medium size vocabulary voice interactive command and control
systems on personal computers, to large vocabulary speech dictation, spontaneous
speech understanding, and limited-domain speech translation. In this chapter we
review some of the key advances in several areas of speech and text recognition. We
also briefly discuss the requirements in designing successful real-world applications
and address technical challenges that need to be faced in order to reach the ultimate
goal of providing an easy-to-use, natural, and flexible voice interface between people

and machines.
","Chapter 1

Introduction

Speech is the most common & primary mode of communication among
human beings. It is the most natural and efficient form of exchanging information
among humans. Human voice conveys much more information such as gender,
emotion and identity of the speaker. (Shikha Gupta, Mr. Amit Pathak, Mr.Achal

Saraf a Research Student , 2001).

As to communicate to those hearing-impaired individual, the speech to text
can be characterized by changing over spoken signal to an arrangement of words
by the method using Android Speech Recognition. In order for a hearing enabled to
understand the hearing-impaired, text to speech can be used to convert a typed text

of the hearing-impaired person to communicate to the hearing-enabled person.

1.1 Project Context

The voice recognition app converts speech-to-text and text-to-speech. The
speech to text conversion can be used for the hearing-impaired person to see the
text spoken from the other person. The proponents chose to create a mobile
application that addresses and supports the special needs of hearing impaired people
to bridge the gap in the challenges of conversing without the use of sign language.

The app has the capability to convert speech into text and also text into speech. The
proponents utilize software packages to create an Android app that allows a hearing-
impaired person to use their Android phone to type the message that then converts

at the receiving side of the person who is the hearing-enabled individual into an
audible message. To respond back to the hearing-i mpaired, the hearing-enabled will
speak via android phone and automatically convert its spoken voice into a readable

message until the end of the conversation.

The project will utilize an Android based application which will run under
an Android Operating System, Using Google Speech/ Cloud Speech Api, text-to-
speech and speech-to-text application will be developed that is customized for
hearing-impaired community. The Google Speech technology has the capabilities
to do any functions on your Android phone, such as calling a friend, set a reminder,
open an application, find contacts and etc. But in every feature of the Google
Speech, the proponents cite that they are not designing a feature which is intended
for the conversation between the hearing-enabled and a hearing-impaired, but in

order to understand with each other without studying sign languages.

The Speech and Text recognition mobile app for hearing-impaired person,
implies to support Google Speech in extending application development. It works
one application in two mobile devices that changing information in a real-time

manner once if they are connected.

1.2 Purpose and Description

The mobile app provides an easy way of communicating to hearing-impaired
people to hearing-enabled individuals. It is easier to understand the information
taken with each other. The app can only understand Clearly speak British or
Americanize accent in terms of converting a speech to text information and text to
speech technology. The mobile app provides a bridge of communication to the

hearing-impaired community that can talk and those who cannot talk.
For hearing-impaired that who are able to talk, they can understand the hearing
enabled by means of converting the speech into text with graphical image. Then for
hearing-impaired who are unable to talk, they are able to express their thoughts and

ideas through converting text into speech. And lastly for hearing-enabled, with the
use of the H.I (Hearing Impaired) chat application, they will not experience a hard

time communicating with the hearing-impaired.

"DETERMINING POTENTIAL INVESTMENT AREAS OF
SURIGAO DEL NORTE
","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The province of Surigao del Norte is rich in natural resources where many
investors are interested in investing when it comes to the leading industries of
Fishery, Agriculture, Mining, and Eco-Tourism. Surigao del Norte is part of
CARAGA that envisions to be the FAME center of the country for the year 2030.
In contribution to the goal of the said region, the researchers come up with the
idea of creating an application that will help potential investors who wants to put
up a business in Surigao del Norte. With the application providing areas and

particular investments on the products of the area.

The proponents adapt the concept of Geographic Information System and
the idea of Decision Support System that will help the investor to expedite
decision making process by providing visual representation of the map of Surigao
del Norte using Open Street Map as the base map of the system. Together with
the map are the data relevant to Surigao del Norte like population density, hazard

susceptibility of a particular area, road maps, facilities, and networks.

During the testing, the proponents conducted a research using the System
Usability Scale Test that will help to evaluate the efficacy of the system. As a

result, the average percentage is 78.63. According to the score measurements
and industry standards, the system is good and doing okay but could use

improvements.

Introduction

1.1 Project Context
In today’s highly competitive and globalized economy, decision-makers
face tough challenges in managing investments in a sustainable and profitable
manner. One of the problems of investors is having costly mistakes upon
investing. Currently, investors still manually gather relevant data to guide them in
determining key investment areas pertaining to Fishery, Agriculture, Mining and
Eco-tourism (FAME) in the province of Surigao del Norte.

Investors often personally go to different agencies or government offices
in order for them to gather data, which will take a long period of time before
concluding which investment area to choose. Potential investors may utilize the
power of internet to conduct further research, but the disadvantage is that there
is no specific website to visit that generates the necessary data for their
evaluation and therefore, information gathered are unreliable for decision-
making.

Surigao del Norte is located in the Northeastern part of Mindanao between
125°15' to 126° 15' east longitude and 9° 18' to 10° 30' north latitude. It is
bounded on the North and East by the Pacific Ocean, on the South by the

Provinces of Agusan del Norte and Surigao del Sur and on the West by the
Surigao Strait. It belongs to the new region, the CARAGA Region, which is
composed of five (5) provinces and six (6) cities.

The CARAGA’s long-term development goal is to become the FAME
center of the country by the year 2030, by developing the region’s abundant
resources in fishery, agriculture, forestry, mining, and eco-tourism as growth
drivers of the region’s economy. (Revised Caraga RDP, 2013-2016)

The proposed system, Determining Potential Investment Areas for
Surigao del Norte (DPIA-SDN), is useful in providing visualization and spatial
analysis by using Geographic Information System (GIS) that has been long
used for data analysis, various researches and studies in areas such as land
use planning, environmental planning, and disaster management planning.
The recent innovations in GIS technology are becoming influential in leading
the market toward development of nationwide computerized open access.
This GIS technology together with Data Driven type of Decision Support
System will help serious prospective investors to determine which potential
areas to invest such as fishery, agriculture, mining, and eco-tourism.

Data Driven type of Decision Support System are form of support
system that focuses on the provision of internal data to aid decision making.
Most often this will come in the form of a data warehouse where the data will
be processed. A data-driven DSS helps to transform large data sets into
meaningful, easy to read business information.(FOIS, 2006) The best
example of a Data Driven DSS is the Geographical Information System which

can be used to visually represent geographically dependent data using maps.

"HERBAL PLANTS EXPERT SYSTEM CAPABLE OF DIAGNOSING

SKIN DISEASES OF THE HUMAN BODY
","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Herbal plants are used to cure certain diseases of the human body, thus,
it is said to be safe as it is natural. One of these are skin diseases, which are
the most common form of disease in humans. At this moment in time, there are
varieties of medicines that is concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of
skin diseases, which is the herbal medicine. Computers with human-level
intelligence like expert system has a great effect on people’s lives. This study
presents the herbal plants expert system capable of diagnosing skin diseases
of the human body which allow users to identify specific disease and to provide
treatment recommendations either what herbal plants to be used in curing the
disease. The study is limited only to the plants that are found in Butuan City
area and only to the skin diseases of the human body. The expert system use
Google Map API that corresponds the location of herbal plant in Butuan City.
The proponents was able to conclude that the expert system has an accuracy

of 60% in diagnosing a certain skin disease.

INTRODUCTION

Nowadays, people use Artificial Intelligence (Al) as a tool that has an
ability to solve problems and find better solution for a certain task. According to
Engelmore, Robert “an expert system is an Artificial Intelligence (Al) tool that is
derived from a branch of computer science. Al's scientific goal is to understand
intelligence by building computer programs that exhibit intelligent behavior.”
Technologies are affecting on how human live, work and entertain, Al is a
product of technology that is popular in terms of business industry such as Al
machines and it improves every day. Al and machine learning will be at the
center of initiatives to modernize agency systems and business processes,

driving the need to break down data silos. (Billy Sokol, 2017)

For thousands of years, herbalism for skin disorders has been used and those
medicinal plants are an important part of our natural wealth. According to the
World Health Organization (WHO), “traditional herbal medicine is naturally
occurring, plant-derived substances with minimal or no industrial processing
that have been used to treat illness within local or regional healing practices.”
Hence, herbal plants are an advantage when it comes to curing certain

diseases as for the purpose of sustaining and maintaining good health. Herbal
plants are affordable and it does not contain any drug that has an adverse

effect.

The Health centers manually diagnose skin diseases that makes the
process of diagnosing slow. Health Center representative recommends the
patients to a dermatologist. Skin diseases specialist is a dermatologist that's
costly and it takes time to set up a schedule for treatment. Immediate remedies
are needed to temporarily medicate the skin diseases; light skin allergies need
to be treated using herbal medicine. Some herbal plants are unusual and hard

to find and the instruction of using the herbal is necessary.

The solution of the stated problem is, to develop an application which is
the herbal plant expert system capable of diagnosing skin diseases of the
human body. The application will help the user identify specific common skin
diseases, in order to have the prescribe appropriate treatment that doesn't
require going to a dermatologist, it can easily recommend herbal medications,
gives an instruction on how to use the herbal and locate some herbal remedies

within Butuan City area.

INTRODUCTION

Barangay is the most basic government unit in the Philippines
according to the local government code (Section 58d). As a basic political
unit, it is the primary planning and implementing unit of government policies,

plans, programs, projects and activities in the community.

Barangay 27 also known as Bayanihan uses a manual process in
providing and handling information and files. These records are important for
different purposes especially for its development. There are government and
private projects that needs information from the map of the said barangay for
its projects and plans to be visualized, the barangay then provide their manual

spot map which is hard to understand and not liable.

To prevent lost tracks of the map of the barangay the researchers
developed a system which is the Barangay Bayanihan Digitized Web Based
Map. Digitized Mapping is the process by which a collection of data is
compiled and formatted into a virtual image. The primary function of this
technology is to produce maps that give accurate representations of a
particular area, detailing major road arteries and other points of interest. The

technology also allows the calculation of distances from one place to another.

Though digital mapping can be found in a variety of computer

applications, such as Google Earth, the main use of this system is to allow
users to view and locate a certain “Purok” specifically in Barangay 27 —
Bayanihan alone, which Barangay 27 — Bayanihan has a total of 341 hectares

with specific location and puroks. Digitized Mapping benefit the Barangay in

its development.

1.1 Project Context

Undertaking a development planning requires an intensive use of
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) as a tool for processing varied forms
of spatial and planning information. With GIS, key stakeholders and
development actors are qprovided with strategic and issue-focused
information that could facilitate productive discussion and generate informed
decision.

Barangay 27- Bayanihan, the last urban Barangay in Butuan City is
now commercial center. It has a total of 341 hectares with specific locations.
The Barangay is in charge of keeping track of the developmental records in
the place. These records are important for the different purposes that the
barangay uses. The system that is being used by the Barangay in providing
information for developmental decision-making is a manual process. They
manually handle files and information they receive. For instance, in giving
infrastructure projects, proposals and other related

land use_ plans,

development reports, they used their manual spot map to visualize the area.
To address this problem, the researchers introduced a Barangay
Based Map Information Systems with Global Positioning System (GPS) for
the Barangay Office of Barangay 27-Bayanihan that will help the Barangay, as
well as the Local Government Sector and the people of the place. The
proposed system is a tool for local planning and project implementation as
well as allows an effective processing and visual presentation to facilitate

active discussion with project developer.

The increasing application of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in
the field of Development Planning came from the need to have better and
more reliable information for informed decision-making. Planning in whatever
form, requires a significant amount of data and information to support the
analysis of existing situation, formulate development goals, objectives and
targets. These aspects of physical and development planning require a
specific mechanism that would allow for the effective processing, analysis,
and visual presentation of information. These mechanisms fall within GIS. GIS
is considered as one of those formalized computer based information systems
that has the inherent capability to process a multitude of data from various

source in order to provide strategic formation for decision-making.

INTRODUCTION

1.1. Project Context

Shatong is a traditional Filipino Game (Known as “Laro ng Lahi’) in the
Philippines. It is a common game played by children in the 1990’s and early
2000's. It is usually played using native materials or wooden sticks. Thus, in
the Philippines, due to limited resources of toys of Filipino children, they
usually come up with inventing games with the use of indigenous materials
they only had. , ,

With the advent of technology, these games are rarely played. Instead
of the usual traditional Filipino Games like Patintero, Tumbang Preso, Piko,
Tago-Taguan, Shatong and the like, many children indulge themselves with
computer games, mobile games and the like. Therefore, the proponents
decided to come up with a particular Mobile Android Game based on Filipino
Traditional Games, such as Shatong. As a result, the current generation will
be able to enjoy the forgotten enjoyable Traditional Filipino Game “Shatong”
in their mobile phones.

The development of Android Shatong Game uses the well-known
Integrated Development Environment of Android Development, such as the
Android Studio. The Event Handling Class and Speech Recognizer Class of
Android Java are vital in this development. Alongside, the game mechanics

plays an important part on how the game will be played and be executed.

"GRAND PALACE PAYROLL SYSTEM
","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Grand Palace Chinese Restaurant is one of the iconic food
destinations in Butuan City. The business started in September
2011, with its building structure formed similar to a Chinese
temple with mixed modern innovation. With the mission to ensure
that each guest receives prompt, professional, friendly and
courteous service.

The essence of this system is to create a web-based
payroll system with daily time record to cater the security needs of
both the employees and the human resource in precision of time
logs records, payslip information and accessibility of information.

Grand Palace uses the manual tallying of log records and
manual calculation of salary for the employees. The system is
used to make records and to avoid impartial salary and time
records—an honest record without any other possible inaccuracy

and to have full meticulous results of transactions.

Keywords: Web-based payroll system, DTR, Payroll,

salary and time records

","4.1. Introduction

Payroll is the method of processing various components such as the
daily time record and other factors in creating the exact salary of every
employee in a company. The human resource manages the whole system to
give the exact amount of pay with the use of multiple included data. The
processing of a company’s payroll involves multiple steps that are susceptible

to automation. (D. Kahn, S. Saini, S.E. Kreimer, S.S. Ferguson. 2002.)

Companies must withhold income tax from employee’s earnings like
SSS, Philhealth and other benefits from the employee’s wages. Payroll system
computes employee’s taxes, deductions and salary. It as well uses the datum
to issue paychecks. These systems also typically prepare payroll reports for
management & tax purposes for federal states & local government according
to the book of Understanding Computers. (Jalbuena, 2014.)

The payroll system is one of the useful system that every company or
business needs. This system can minimize the work load involved in
maintaining the employee's overall account. It reduces human efforts and helps

in maintaining an error-free employee record.

1.2 Project Context

Grand Palace Chinese Restaurant is one of the businesses of 4 ACES

Corporation. This company is a private corporation that is conducting multiple
businesses. Currently, this establishment's process in time keeping is manual.
2
They use a log book which every employee jots down their time-in and time-out

record every day. These records are essential for processing all employee's
payroll it is the basis in generating their salary. Generating the payroll is done
manually by the HR. The HR executes the procedure every week in Grand

Palace, every Saturday is the pay day for a week’s worth of work.

As the researchers interviewed the current HR of grand palace, Ms.

Cendy Vergara, the researchers found out that there are 57 employees working
in Grand Palace and the current methods of payroll and time keeping which has
feeble foundation and is prone to imprecision in collecting data. Having a log
book may suffice in terms of functionality, however its credibility in accurate
time-in and time-out input is unreliable as it can be manipulated. Since it is
written down, the data is prone to accidents that occur when an employee would
misplace the log book, water falling on its pages that would leave the records
in the logbook faded which damages the logbook, or incidents that could rip its
pages which results to inaccurate calculation of salary. These log books have
no back-up copy that raises a risk for the salary of the employees and create
additional work load for the HR. The payroll process is manually tallied. It is
also a long process that would take too much time and effort from the HR
because of all the aspects considered to create salary for every employee such
as: late deduction, benefits deduction, absences, holiday (red calendar)
additional, overtime, etc. The manual process is not only difficult but often
results in accounting anomalies, which drastically causes the company to incur

Significant liability in the form of back payments and penalties as well as
3

substantial ex i
pense of time and money to determine the cause and resolv
e

problems.

Based on the researchers' analysis and interviews conducted, it can be
concluded that the system will immensely benefit the HR in providing and
processing the payroll system by eliminating the manual work proceeds. This
will give more time for the HR to conduct a more substantial work output, aside

from the routine payroll procedure. The convenience of a payroll system cannot

be overestimated. With this study, the project team will or lessen those hard-

end manual labor through the automation. In the time-keeping aspect, the

researchers will impose a real-time recording of the log-records by integrating
a biometric device. With this component added in the DTR, the manual

calculation of salary will diminish and since the records are saved in the cloud,

the risk of data loss will dramatically decrease.

"ACB Educational Assessment and Cashiering System

With Online Queuing
","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Technology nowadays is growing fast and it affects the developing
organization’s success. The evolution of technology plays an important role in
developing this system. ACLC Butuan is one of the growing institutions. The
finance department of ACLC still using the old Assessment and Cashiering
System with an error occurs. The proponents proposed to create new system

which still in-line with the process of the old system to replace the old system

and eliminate those errors and boost the service of the institution to their clients.

Assessment and Cashiering System with Online Queuing is a system
mainly for Accounting and Cashier Staff and Queue Administrator. The ACLC

Introduction

Project Context

The AMA Computer Learning Center College of Butuan (ACB)
was established on July 7, 1997. Since ACB had just an average
population of students back on the 90’s, it was effective to use manual

processing of payment transactions and assessing students’ fees.

Until the year 2006 the school’s student population has risen, in
order to manage the growing number of population, the institution started
using the computerized assessment and cashiering system that is
dependent to School Management System to have the data of students
enrolled in the institution to process the assessment and payment
transactions of the students. Until today, the ACB is still using the
Assessment and Cashiering System to facilitate every transaction of the
institution. Basic transactions are working well and can be managed by
the (system’s manager) programmer who maintains the system. But
there are underlying problems of the said system like generating
assessments and issuing receipts that all of the system users are very
dependent on the system maintenance personnel when it comes to the

back-end transactions and components.
The current Assessment and Cashiering System lacks features

that are necessary to the overall function of the system.

Stated below are the main problems which regard to the

functional of the system:

First, the user cannot add or save raw fees of the students in the
system. Raw fees are fees or particulars that the system will compute to
generate the bill or assessment of the student. If ever there are changes
in the raw fees, the system maintenance personnel will directly add or

amend the raw fees in the database.

Second, there is no system user management where the
administrators can add or update users and provide a privilege to access
the system of a certain user. If new user will be added, again, the system
maintenance personnel will access directly to the database to add a new
user. When it comes to adding particulars, the system maintenance
personnel must still input the needed information to the database.

Third, due to the reason that the current Assessment and
Cashiering System developed using the VB6 platform, there are
compatibility issues between the said platform and new operating
systems especially nowadays, most of the computers are already using

latest operating systems with no longer support older version of Visual

Basic.
Fourth, the system database is not normalized causing

redundancy of data and occupies more space in the database.

Lastly, the queuing system only allows three stations to serve,
making it difficult if there are other departments requested for queue

slots in the system.

With this problem in hand, the overall performance of the system
deteriorates. Security is at risk since the maintenance personnel can
directly access the database every update and no user management that
will prevent user to use all features according to their function. In terms
of system’s reliability and availability, the raw data is not updated by the
system maintenance personnel so the system cannot process and give
accurate information thus affects system credibility. On the system’s
scalability, the database is not normalized, data redundancy is inevitable
thus if data input becomes larger in number that may cause space

shortage.

To address the aforementioned concerns, the proponents
proposed the ACLC College of Butuan Educational Assessment and
Cashiering System with Online Queuing intended to be a web-based
system that is Dependent to School Management System to have the
data of students enrolled in the institution which is dynamic and

interactive that is capable of giving proper data, efficient storage use and

"AGUSAN RIVER FLOOD MONITORING USING RASPBERRY PI WITH
SMS ADVISORY
","ABSTRACT

Agusan River Flood Monitoring using Raspberry Pi with SMS Advisory

has been developed to give warning and to help the residents of the affected
barangays because Butuan City was prone to flooding during rainy season.
This study focuses only on the water level detection and early warning system
(via SMS) that alerts affected residents for a potential flood event and give the
address of the nearest evacuation center in their area. Furthermore, inquiry
was also included in this study to become more interactive wherein individuals
in the community could inquire the actual water level status and the residents
can also turn on and off the SMS notification alert through SMS keyword.
Using System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as a method in making the
software was very useful and helpful in identifying errors during the
development. The following technologies like Raspberry Pi 3 B+, Ultrasonic
Sensor, and GSM are used in making the prototype. The proponent
conducted a survey for the software quality of the system to the affected
barangay and was highly acceptable based on the total mean obtained of
4.52. The software was indeed useful to the residents who live in the flood
prone area because it helps them evacuate early before the situation get
worst. This eliminates the manual way of detecting the water level of the flood
and late receiving of SMS waming of the residents. it was relevant and
important as per needs for safety and welfare of the community.
","CHAPTER |
INTRODUCTION

1.1 Introduction

Agusan River Basin was known as the third largest river basin of the

Philippines. According to the Butuan City Disaster Risk Reduction and

Management office (CDRRMO) they can predict the water level of Agusan
River manually, by means of communicating with the affected barangay for an
update of their situation. Also the CDRRMO said that they only knew if a
barangay was already affected by the flood once they receive a call from that
barangay. After receiving any updates from the affected barangay they would
contact the Philippine Information Agency (PIA) to send warnings and alerts to
the people who live in the affected barangay. But according to Hon. Jullieto D.

Llagas chairman of barangay Poyohon they don’t have any connection with

CDRRMO they do things by their own during a flood. Based on this matter the

proponents decided to conduct a research and studies which leads them to

create the Agusan River Flood Monitoring using Raspberry Pi with SMS

Advisory.

Flooding has always resulting in enormous anxiety on countries across
the continent where by lost of life’s, people displaced, agricultural land
submerged in mud’s, roads, bridges and houses washed away (Suchita2014).
Although flooding was an abnormal phenomena agers ago, but now it was
considered a life treating natural disaster for the mankind (Siva, 2013). Over
the last 25 years Flood Early Warning System (FEWS) has been developed to
numerous rivers in the world (Vermeulen et al; 2014). Several expert have

Studies ove j
r the years on ways to improve flood control, thereby reducing risk
(T omaszkiewicz, 2013).

Rivers water level has been monitored and it has a

The Agusan

corresponding evacuation protocol for the people who live in the affected

area. Flood Alert level1 means that all residents of the affected barangay has

been alerted for them to be aware of the situation and danger. Flood Alert

Level 2 means that the vulnerable sector composed of elderly, children,
pregnant women, lactating mother and person with disabilities (PWDS) to be
Pre-Emptively Evacuated. Flood Alert Level 3 means that the barangay
Officials, PNP, BFP must order residents of the affected barangay to evacuate
and proceed to Evacuation Center. But the BCDRRMO has difficulty of giving
waming to the people who live in the affected area in advance time because

they just wait for the Barangay official to contact them to report the situation

when the flood was already happening.

Therefore, the proponent decided to develop Agusan River Flood
Monitoring using Raspberry pi with SMS Advisory to give warning and help to

INTRODUCTION
Introduction
Microgreens, according to Warner (2012), as their name implies,
are small greens that are often no more than 2 inches tall. Beyond
looking great on a salad, sandwiches, or as garnish, microgreens also
offer a unique assortment of flavors, nutritional and medicinal benefits.
Researcher Qin Wang (2012) says that, the microgreens were 4 to 40
fold more concentrated with nutrients than their mature counterparts. For
example, red cabbage microgreens had 40 times more vitamin E and six
times more vitamin C than mature red cabbage. Cilantro microgreens
had three times more beta-carotene than mature cilantro. Microgreens
can be grown inside a greenhouse where climate and other factors that
help grow this kind of plant can be regulated or can be home grown as

they are capable of living with a little amount of sunlight and a little

amount of water.

There are factors to be considered in planting and growing
Microgreens. Soil moisture can affect the growth of microgreens as well
as sunlight, air and proper ventilation. People cannot take care of them
all the time. So, in this paper, we present a critical discussion of the
research on taking care of Microgreens. There has been a range of
insightful contributions to the scientific literature both in terms of
theoretical issues and practical aspects. The main aim of this research

is to highlight the new trends and key research achievements that can
help planting this Microgreens with the aid of technological
advancements and innovations. But using this can be costly, bulky and

hard operate.

Due to these reasons and with the help of today’s technology, the
proponents came up with the idea to make an automated small version
of a Greenhouse which can regulate climate based on the plant's climate
specifications. It will also help plant and manage microgreens and its
needs (water, sunlight, ventilation) with or without the user’s intervention
using only the cheapest materials that utilizes operations similar to the
expensive ones (which can also operate without users intervention) to
help address these problems and provide solutions that will enhance the

cultivation of microgreens.

4.1 Introduction

Libraries are the nucleus of a college (Arndt, 2016). They hum with social
and intellectual activity and are truly the center of learning. They contain the
critical resources that make learning possible—books, journals, workstations,
printers, etc.—as well as skilled specialists who can help a student navigate a
research topic. The library is often the place students go to get down to
business; to reflect and process what they have learned in class. Nowadays,
students don’t even have to go to the library in order to benefit from its
resources. College libraries provide access to invaluable online resources, from

databases to electronic journals to tutorials.

According to Anderson (2015), there are trends in research libraries that
student visiting hours with library circulation data is way far from the number of
the past years, the number of students that visits the library is dropping. He
determined that every year 3.5% of the total student volume inside the library
is diminished. He also points out on his research that the amount of the
borrowed books every ear is diminished due to lack of students visiting the
public library. Also, he concluded that the volume of the students every year

would gradually drop every year if the lack of innovation in the library would

remain the same.

The proponents developed a system with an augmented reality feature
because it offers a technology available on mobile devices that allows users to
experience a layered, computer-generated enhancement to their real-world

perception. It blends digital components into the real world as a user becomes
2

immersed in an augmented view of

"GRABBAGE: A HAND GESTURE CONTROLLED
GARBAGE PICKING BOT
","ABSTRACT

The prototype GrabBage: A Hand Gesture Controlled Garbage Picking
Bot provides an innovative solution to environmental issues mainly to the
garbage problem. It aims to minimize the amount of trash that ends up in the
landfills and oceans wherein the prototype integrates the capabilities of human
hand gestures for environmental protection by developing a Hand Gesture
Controlled Garbage Picking Bot. The proponents also take action to the
previous study about the level of information and education campaign on solid
waste management and household practices on solid waste disposal in Butuan
City. The overall conclusion to the study states that the level of IEC in both rural
and urban barangays of Butuan City is poor. The data provides evidence that
methods such as public forum or general assembly, focus group discussion,
installation of tarpaulin and other signs, television ad and radio broadcast,
house to house information campaign, and school campaign were seldom
carried out and one of the recommendations set is the need to create new
structures, and undertake innovative plans that are more responsive to the
needs of the communities. By the proponents’ idea, it establishes mechanisms
through the prototype to improve awareness and broad dissemination of
relevant information on efficient disposal of garbage. In summary, this
innovation has been prepared with the motivation of being useful to
entrepreneurial projects based on robotics technology used in environmental
protection. The prototype serves as a starting point in terms of providing
solutions to waste issues to be considered and consulted.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

Waste is a huge and growing problem where people produce vastly more
waste than our planet can sustain. The world’s people produce an astonishing
3.6 million tons of municipal solid waste each day. By 2025, that’s projected to
rise to 6.1 million metric tons per day. While it's generally contained in highly
developed countries, it’s generally out of control in the rest of the word,
adversely affecting health and contaminating our air, landscape, freshwater and

oceans. [Retrieved from: synovapower.com/a-global-problem/, 2018]

Throwing and collecting waste is a system that is currently under
scrutiny. The scrutiny came with the onset of rain and of the reality that there
are Filipinos who throw waste with insouciance: anywhere and everywhere.
And, instead of dump trucks, rivers, seas and oceans are the collectors.
(BusinessMirror, 2019) The Philippines is one of the top contributors to plastic
pollution, generating 2.7 million tons of plastic every year. Following this
trajectory of plastic production and mismanagement, UN reports predict that by
2050, there will be more plastic in the oceans than there are fish. The task of
reversing this issue is as big and wide as the ocean, but small actions can make

a huge difference. (Cimatu, 2019)

Today, there have been quite a number of initiatives implemented to
improve the waste management system and to segregate solid waste into

its particular types and features. However, there are still shortcomings due
to some reasons encountered. One of them Is due to the attitude of men who
refuse to participate and practice waste segregation. This may result in the
waste being mixed up and make it difficult for the labors to separate the waste
manually. Apart from that, a number of technologies and researches being
made to segregate waste automatically in either domestic level or industrial
level still require improvements to increase the efficiency of a successful

automated waste separation system. ( Ahamad et. al, 2019)

In today's sophisticated world; robots and autonomous machines are an
integral part of daily routine. They help in completing daily chores for human
beings; especially for physically challenged and elderly people of society.
These robots are also critical in many industries as they reduce life casualties
and financial degradation while performing risky and critical operations. In such
cases developing a Robotic system would be helpful to keep the environment
clean and tidy. (Soundarya et. al, 2018) Many elements of robots are built with
inspiration from nature. Construction of the manipulator as the arm of the robot
is based on a human arm. The robot has the ability to manipulate objects such
as pick and place operations. (Jambotkar, 2019) Most of all sectors, the work
is done by robots or a robotic arm that has a different number of degrees of
freedom (DOF’s) as per the requirement. The idea is to change the perception
of remote controls for actuating manually operated Robotic-Arm. The
implementation of wireless robotic arm presents a thoughtful way to eradicate
the buttons, joysticks and replace them with more intuitive techniques that such
as controlling the complete Robotic Arm by the operator's hand gesture.

(Saurabh et.al, 2015)
3

For this reason, the proponents came up with the idea of creating a
prototype called “GrabBage: A Hand Gesture Controlled Garbage Picking Bot’,
which integrates human hand gestures that help reduce the amount of garbage
that ends up in the landfills and oceans. A prototype is an interactive clean-up
task, where the user guides the robot using hand gestures to go to specific
locations that need to be cleaned and also instructs the robot to pick up

garbage.

Furthermore, the motivation of conducting this study is to facilitate the
elderly and/or physically disabled people who cannot walk or who are
experiencing problems in performing their day-to-day activities like picking up
scattered garbage. The prototype can be simply implemented to design and
operate with the help of hand-gestures which in turn commands the prototype.
It might be difficult or unsafe for humans to do some tasks like picking up
dangerous chemicals. Thus, repeated pick and place actions are important in
certain industries. In this field it is quite complicated to control the robot or
machine with a remote or switches; sometime the operator may get confused
between the switches and buttons, so the proponents aim to design a new

concept to control the machine through human hand gestures.

INTRODUCTION

Barangay is the most basic government unit in the Philippines
according to the local government code (Section 58d). As a basic political
unit, it is the primary planning and implementing unit of government policies,

plans, programs, projects and activities in the community.

Barangay 27 also known as Bayanihan uses a manual process in
providing and handling information and files. These records are important for
different purposes especially for its development. There are government and
private projects that needs information from the map of the said barangay for
its projects and plans to be visualized, the barangay then provide their manual

spot map which is hard to understand and not liable.

To prevent lost tracks of the map of the barangay the researchers
developed a system which is the Barangay Bayanihan Digitized Web Based
Map. Digitized Mapping is the process by which a collection of data is
compiled and formatted into a virtual image. The primary function of this

technology is to produce maps that give accurate representations of a

particular area, detailing major road arteries and other points of interest. The

technology also allows the calculation of distances from one place to another.

Though digital mapping can be found in a variety of computer

applications, such as Google Earth, the main use of this system is to allow
users to view and locate a certaln “Purok” specifically in Barangay 27 —
Bayanihan alone, which Barangay 27 — Bayanihan has a total of 344 hectares
with specific location and puroks. Digitized Mapping benefit the Barangay in

its development.
1.1 Project Context

Undertaking a development planning requires an intensive use of
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) as a tool for processing varied forms
of spatial and planning information. With GIS, key stakeholders and
development actors are qprovided with strategic and issue-focused
information that could facilitate productive discussion and generate informed
decision.

Barangay 27- Bayanihan, the last urban Barangay in Butuan City is
now commercial center. It has a total of 341 hectares with specific locations.
The Barangay is in charge of keeping track of the developmental records in
the place. These records are important for the different purposes that the
barangay uses. The system that is being used by the Barangay in providing
information for developmental decision-making is a manual process. They
manually handle files and information they receive. For instance, in giving
land use plans, infrastructure projects, proposals and other related

development reports, they used their manual spot map to visualize the area.
To address this problem, the researchers introduced a Barangay
Based Map Information Systems with Global Positioning System (GPS) for
the Barangay Office of Barangay 27-Bayanihan that will help the Barangay, as
well as the Local Government Sector and the people of the place. The
proposed system is a tool for local planning and project implementation as
well as allows an effective processing and visual presentation to facilitate

active discussion with project developer.

The increasing application of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in
the field of Development Planning came from the need to have better and
more reliable information for informed decision-making. Planning in whatever
form, requires a significant amount of data and information to support the
analysis of existing situation, formulate development goals, objectives and
targets. These aspects of physical and development planning require a
specific mechanism that would allow for the effective processing, analysis,
and visual presentation of information. These mechanisms fall within GIS. GIS
is considered as one of those formalized computer based information systems

that has the inherent capability to process a multitude of data from various

source in order to provide strategic formation for decision-making.

"VEHICULAR LOCKING SYSTEM WITH REAL-TIME LOCATION
MONITORING USING GPS AND ARDUINO
","Abstract

Vehicular Locking System with Real-Time Location Monitoring using
GPS and Arduino has been developed to give locking system and monitoring
system and to help the vehicular owners in Butuan City because of the fast-
growing populating of vehicle owners. This study focuses on locking,
monitoring and give messaging command (via SMS) that communicate with
the vehicular owner to update the vehicle owners from theft or unwanted
access to the vehicle. Furthermore, an inquiry was also included in this study
to become more interactive wherein individuals in the community could
inquire the actual vehicle status and the owners can also turn on and off the
SMS notification alert through SMS keyword. The vehicle can be monitored
through the web application. Using the System Development Life Cycle
(SDLC) as a method in making the software was very useful and helpful in
identifying errors during the development. The following technologies like
Arduino Uno, GSM and Buzzer are used in making the prototype. The
proponents conducted a survey for the software quality of the system to the
vehicular owners and was highly acceptable based on the total mean
obtained of 4.1956. The prototype was indeed useful to the vehicular owners
because it helps them to monitor the vehicle in the situation if someone else's
in the family used it. This eliminates the manual way of locating the vehicle
real-time and late receiving of SMS warning of the vehicular owners. It was
relevant and important as per the needs for safety and welfare of the

community.

","INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

Car vehicle is one of the most valued possessions nowadays and having
one of this in the Philippines most specially to ordinary company employee is
very difficult to become a reality and losing it is really a cruel imagination if it
happens. Therefore, looking for other means of securing cars from theft using
the present technology (Laguador, J.M., et al 2013).

In recent years theft has been seriously increased and there is no safety
for people and their properties. Security plays a vital role in monitoring a
building in the absence or presence of people. Theft refers to the crime
involving the taking of a person's property without their permission. Most of the
theft happens by door break-ins. 75% of theft occurs during night time. The thief
may take off the fuse, so they cannot be easily identified and if they caught,
they can be easily escaped (Deepika, S. et al, 2015).

Based in Camp Crame, January 5 to September 6, 214 vehicles were
Stolen on the streets while 140 forcibly taken from their owners in residential
areas (villages and subdivisions). These represent 44% and 29%, respectively,
of a total of 489 reported carnapping cases. With Directorate for Investigation
and Detective Management (DIDM) records that show 64% of carnapping
incidents during said period happened between 12:01 and 8: 00 in the morning
(Gonzales, S., 2015).

With the fast-growing population of vehicle owners, it is difficult to locate

one to others manually. With the help of a vehicular locking system with real-
2
time location monitoring using GPS and Arduino, it presents an easy way of
tracking the vehicle speed and location. It also provides remote access to the
vehicle that the owner has the privilege to stop the vehicle when it will be stolen
and activating the emergency alarm by SMS.

GPS, or the Global Positioning System, is a global navigation satellite
system that uses at least 24 satellites, a receiver and algorithms to provide
location, velocity and time synchronization for air, sea and land travel. The
satellite system consists of six earth-centered orbital planes, each with four
satellites. GPS works at all times and in almost all weather conditions. This post
answers “What is GPS?” and explains how it works. In general, there are five
key uses of GPS: Location, Navigation, Tracking, Mapping, and Timing. (Keyes
J. et al, 2017)

Meanwhile, Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on
easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs -
light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message and turn it into an
output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online.
You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the
microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming
language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on
Processing.

Thus, the combination of GPS using Arduino, is relevant to create a tool
in which every vehicular user can use as a locator of the vehicles. With this, it
can allow you to get a real-time view of the position, route, and time of travel in
any vehicle, allowing you to get an understanding of the location of any vehicle

in your fleet, no matter how big or how small. In addition to these features, the
proponents aim to include the remote feature of the system in which the user
can remotely stop the vehicle in case of an unauthorized user of the vehicle.

Hence, the study aimed to provide a solution to the problem concerning the

rampant vehicle theft on the community.

Keywords: Access, Credit Score, View Borrowers, Portal, Credit Record
","Chapter 1

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the study

Credit is a very important product in banking and financial institutions.
There is always a customer in need of a loan. Since Loans are always
accompanied by risks, it is important to identify suitable applicants, and there
have to be a means to determine and separate the good applicants from the
bad. To solve this issue, financial institutions such as banks started
developing credit scores. Using the customer’s credit scores lenders can
define the risk of loan applicants. By calculating the credit score, lenders can
make a decision as to who gets credit, would the person be able to pay off the
loan and what percentage of credit or loan they can get (Lyn C. Thomas,

David B. Edelman and Jonathan N. Crook 2002).

Credit Reporting is one of the most important institutions in modern
financial system how credit reporting works in the financial system around the
world, to provide empirical evidence of the value of credit reporting data for
credit analysis, and to identify appropriate public policy recommendation.
Credit records such as a previous loan of a person performance tool to predict
his or her future behavior. And also, Credit scoring is used by the lenders from
different company and institution to help decide on whether to extend or deny
credit of their borrowers. One of the most important kits, to classify a bank
customers, as a part of the credit evaluation process to reduce the current

and the expected risk of a customer being bad credit, is credit scoring. (Hand

& Jacka, 1998, p. 106)
According to Janice Jardio an employee of Macondray Finance
Corporation one of the small lending company in Butuan city to have an
access of the borrowers credit information they do background checking of
the client personal information. By that, the lending company have the basis if
they can assure to lend money to clients. They said that in terms of sharing
information to other lending company they cannot easily give the information
of the clients if the other lending company wants to know the information of
the borrower. In addition, the lending company can share information but
limited only because of competition and for the sake of the clients data
privacy. According also to one of the employee of QCredit Corporation that
the data are centralized, the information was shared only to the different
branches of QCredit Corporation. Moreover, on getting information about the
borrowers, the lending company needs more background information
checking or so-called customer intelligence (Cl) to determine if the borrowers

of the lending company can manage the loan payments.

The use of credit records and related decision tools, such as credit
scoring can also facilitate the supervision of financial institutions by providing
standard and objective criteria for credit analysis.

Therefore, the proponents decided to develop A Web Portal Application
for Accessing Micro Credit Records to help the lending company to have
access to the borrowers previous credit records with the credit scores. Also
with this study, the lenders may obtain borrowers credit records to know how
borrowers manage financial responsibilities and to help lenders decide
whether to lend the borrowers or not. Also, to know the other lending
companies where the borrowers have a previous credit, with the credit score
the lenders can evaluate the borrowers creditworthiness to make lending

decision.
4.2 Project Context

Nowadays, most of the lenders encounter some problems on granting
loans to the borrowers. Specifically, to borrowers who default to pay the loan
on time and applying loans to other company while still paying off the previous
loans. Most lending companies way of getting information to other lending
institutions is through contact, asking the information on the different lending
companies if the borrower have a loan to other lending companies or other
institution Lenders must evaluate the borrowers, for the lenders to be aware
and decide whether to grant a loan or not. The said system can help the
lending companies to easily access and view the borrowers credit records

with the credit score.

To have access view to individual borrowers credit record together with
the credit score, the proponents decided to develop this system for lenders to
know the borrowers credit record with the credit score. Also, to know the
previous credit of borrowers to other lending companies. So that, lenders will

know if the borrowers are good payers or not.

A Web Portal Application for Accessing Micro Credit Record was
developed by the proponents to lending companies to access view to any
borrowers on other lending company or institution. So the lending companies
will be aware of the financial credit record of the borrowers. By that, the
lending company can make good decisions based on the borrowers
creditworthiness. In the said system, the lenders in a different lending
company must first register before they can access the borrowers credit
records, for them to view the credit records with the credit scores. By doing
that, the lenders have an insight on how the borrowers manage the loans,

then the lenders can now make a decision whether to grant a loan or not.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

In the Philippines, smoking is the single most preventable cause of early
death according to the Department of Health. Because of this, the government
raised tobacco excise taxes to reduce the number of cigarettes that are being
used by smokers. However, it still doesn’t change the fact that it is still harmful
not only in the environment but also to those who inhale it which are classified
as second-hand smokers. While the government has been increasing taxes for
goods such as cigarettes, nearly a quarter of Filipinos continue to use cigarettes
as many of them find it hard to break the habit. On May 16, 2017, Health
Secretary Paulyn Ubial said stated that the president of the Philippines, Rodrigo
Duterte, signed an Executive Order (EO) 26 which implemented the nationwide
smoking ban that prohibits smoking in all public places in the Philippines. These
no smoking locations include schools, hospitals, clinics, government offices,
food operation areas, elevators, jeepney, bus, and more. The Executive Order
also bans the sale, distribution, and purchase of cigarettes to and from minors,
this law results in reducing the majority of the non-smokers to inhale smoke
from smokers.

After the researchers’ study about the issue, the researchers came up
with the idea of developing a hardware device that will prevent smokers from
smoking in public places for the sake of secondhand smoke to avoid developing

health problems like lung cancer and other respiratory diseases. A hardware
2
device that detects smokers in public that uses image recognition t
smoker and notifies the authorities. It will give the location of the seine
validate if it’s in the public area or not. oe
1.2 Project Context
Smoking is the world's leading preventable cause of death. More than
1.1 billion people smoke worldwide, according to the World Health
Organization, and more people are continually joining the ranks. Every day in
the U.S. alone, more than 3,200 youth aged 18 years old and younger smoke
their first cigarette, while another 2,100 youth and young adults move from
smoking occasionally to having it as a daily habit. The most downcast part of

the situation is that these people already know it can cause them health

problems but continue to smoking.
The researchers decided to propose A Geotagging and Detection

"FENSEC: AN AUTOMATED FENCE INTRUDER DETECTION SYSTEM
USING SELF-ORGANIZING MAP(SOM)
","ABSTRACT

This study is about Fensec: An automated fence intruder detection using
Self -organizing Map. The study focuses in developing system that would
automatically notifies the owner or the personnel in-charge if there is an intruder
detected over the fence by sending an alarm to the web application and also
sending SMS notification to the owner of the building and house. The study was
conducted for the purpose of finding an alternative solution for the problem of
having a rampant house break-in nowadays. There is a possibility that the
security cannot attain and monitor the premise 24/7 in which the owner cannot
look up to their houses. The researchers aimed to develop an automated fence
intruder detection that would automatically detect fence intruder in the business
buildings and houses who have fences in their properties. The new developed
system must be evaluated in terms of functionality, reliability, efficiency and
usability. By developing the system, the water fall development model was used
in order not proceed to the next development phase if the first phase is not yet
finished. The system and prototype were improved and implemented into an
imbedded system to benefit people who has fences to their homes and
business buildings. In addition, it can be an efficient solution to the risk of every
buildings and houses because of its features that can automatically detect a
fence intruder during day and night. The study has reached to its purpose in
developing an automated fence intruder detection in a real time capturing of
intruder. During the survey for the system quality, the system came up with the
average of 3.84 which means the system is acceptable. The researchers
conclude that the developed system is acceptable in accordance to the ISO/IEC
Quality standard model.

1.1 Rationale of the Study

Security allows clear surveillance to those entering and leaving the
grounds. Locking security gates allow staff to verify visitors, this is integral for
controlling unauthorized departure of students (Start Web Solution, 2019).
Nowadays, reliable, trusted home and properties are essential to ensure the
safety of people and lot. Fence is the first and basic security a house and
business building should have but thieves, burglars and intruders are not
scared to trespass anymore. The latest FBI Uniform Crime reporting Statistic,
property crime rates including burglary, larceny and vehicle thief. There are
roughly 2.5 million burglars a year 66% of those being home break-ins and only
13% of those are solved by the police due to lack of witness or physical
evidence and as stated there are 1,495,790 burglaries during the day and break
ins are 6% more likely to occur during the day where no one is home and

1,324,090 during the night. (The National Council for Home Safety and

Security, 2019)

Anyone wants a safe home, properties and offices. The Self-Organizing
Map Classifier for Vision Based Auto intruder detection embracing the method

of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) will offer a remarkable result in defending the

residence, stuffs and also the properties from thieves, intruders or burglars. The

lf-organizing map is based on the random presentation of

training of the se
A., Schmid, V., 2014). Crime is

several input vectors one at a time (Baese,
a
increasing as day by day; thus, the demand of trusted, and reliable security
system is increasing. Many home securities have proven effective in preventing
home burglaries (Talorete, V. and Guirnaldo S., 2016). A home without a
security systems are 300% more likely to be burglarized and 83% of home

burglars admitted that they look specifically if there is an alarm and 60% of them
would change their mind if there was one installed (Charlotte, 2019) . Self-

organizing map is essential to the developed study because it is a powerful

paradigm that is extensively applied for clustering and visualization purpose

and data analysis in various domains (ESANN, 2015).

Self-organizing map is an unsupervised neural network that reduces the

input dimensionally in order to represent its distribution as a map (Big data and

Smart Services System, 2017).

Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) are most commonly used security in
homes, stores, bank and businesses but the disadvantages is they can only
monitor in limited areas and cannot give warning or alarm if there is burglar

caught by the cameras and some criminals can vandalize the cameras or

sticking gums in it (Leaf Group Ltd., 2019)

Walls or fences in a required front yard building setback, including walls
for single-family dwellings, shall be four (4) feet maximum in height. An increase
in the maximum four (4) foot height may be permitted subject to a use permit.
With a use permit, the maximum height may be up to six (6) feet, except that
an additional two (2) feet of height may be permitted for architectural
features including but not limited to archways, pergolas, and other similar

features. For all heights above four (4) feet, the use permit shall demonstrate
that a natural surveillance to the street will be maintained by incorporating

openings, providing transparent materials, or varying height/materiais(City
Hall, 31 E. Sth St., Tempe, AZ 85281).

The proponents come up with this study to help the residents,
businesses and property owners in securing their buildings and houses. The

proponents want to develop a security system that aimed to detect the fence

intruder and directly send warning alarm notification to the owner or assigned

4.1 Rationale of the Study
Mobile learning is an exciting and important movement. In our ever-chang-
ing marketplace, today pre-school students are being educated. Largely for jobs
that has not yet been invented. Technology is being created and updated at a
frenetic pace and growing more pervasive and useful with each stride. Accord-
ing to (Franklin Delano Rosevelt, 2017), we cannot always build the future for
our youth, but we can build our youth for the future. As schools face dwindling
resources and higher stakes than ever mobile technology hold the key in im-
proving the educational system and re-engaging pre-school students. Mobile
Technology offers plethora features and it can be benefitted in which it enables
to break the education system wide open, engaging pre-school students in
making educational experiences more meaningful if the schools can effectively
utilized, structured, and integrated approaches for implementation of this new
technology.

The curriculum of the preschool is the National Kindergarten Curriculum
Guide based on the Republic Act 8980 known as the Early Childhood Care
Development (ECCD) Act - this act promulgating a comprehensive national sys-
tem for early childhood care and development, providing funds and for the other
purposes. As children grow into early childhood, their world will begin to open
up. They will become more independent and begin to focus more on adults and
children outside of the family. They want to explore and ask about the things

around them even more. Preschools curricula take into account the length of
the preschool day. Many preschools run for only a few hours a day, while others
(especially in public school settings) run for much longer days. Some even run
longer than a typical school day to cover all the parent's work hours (Amanda

Rock, 2019)

E-learning as the appropriate application of the Internet to support the de-
livery of learning, skills, and knowledge in a holistic approach not limited to any
particular courses, technologies, or infrastructures. It considers e-learning core
products of content, technologies, and services. The emphasis is upon the im-
portance of integrated learning paths that vary according to the student, the
subject material, the level of competence, and corporate or student prefer-
ences. Successful implementation of e-learning requires the same manage-
ment commitment as other mission-critical organization-wide initiatives. Most of
all e-learning needs to be compelling to the audience targets, offering the

learner a resource that is seen as appealing, valuable and productive to their

goals and aspirations (Paul Henry, 2001)

The goal of object detection is to detect all instances of objects from a known
class, such as people, cars or faces as an image. Typically, only a small number
of instances of the object is present in the image but there is a very large num-
ber of possible locations and scales at which they can occur and need some-
how to be explored. Audio can be a necessary component in learning when
sounds themselves are the object of learning. However, audio is more often
considered when the audience is seen as needing a supplement or alternative
to text due to visual impairment, low levels of literacy, dyslexia or English being

a second language—or simply where the target audience is not receptive to
text.

The application is more advantage than teaching the students manually in
terms in object detecting. The system can automatically detect when the cam-
era is facing an object and it will read the objects name one at a time base from
the distance of the objects from nearest to farthest. The application also re-
quires a password to exit the application for safety purposes. Based on the
proponents’ conducted survey, children age 3-5 years old are curious on things
around them especially the things inside the classroom so the application will
give them excitement to learn because it can’t just give them joy but it can also
give them knowledge in identifying the object. The application will benefit both
of the teachers and the students because it made the discussion easier and the

teacher will only guide the students in using the application while the students
will learn and enjoy at the same time.

This study aimed to provide a better way to teach the young ones to identify
nize and in this way, the learning of

the basic objects that they need to recog

the children will as easy as it can be.

a An implementation of Vehicle to Vehicle Communication for Automobile
Collision Avoidance using Ad-hoc Network has been developed to provide an
optimal solution on vehicle collisions. This study focuses only on helping people
to avoid vehicle accidents that leads to both minor and major injuries and worse

","INTRODUCTION

4.1 Rationale of the Study
Road is a place where people uses their vehicles like motor vehicle,
bicycle and cart to transport people, items and many more from one place to
another. There are different names for roads few of them are controlled-access
highway, toll road and avenues (Road, July 2019). Road transport is basically
the main form of transportation and it actually plays a vital role in humans’ daily
life —it is actually used by people to make a living (Labana A, etal., 2015). Road
accidents happen more often than people could have ever imagine and it is
undoubtedly the cause of the most damage (ICDO 2019). According to Thomas
Watteyne (March 2018), road crashes and the damage they entail represent a
serious issue and are one of the main causes of death. Also, according to the
National Highway Traffic Administration (NHTSA), car accidents occur every
minute of the day. A vehicle collision occurs when two or more vehicles bump
into each other and sometimes to road obstacles such as animals, tree and

utility pole. Vehicle collisions can lead minor to major injury, death and property

damage (Traffic Collision, June 2019).

Every year, there are 1.25 million people around the world are dying
because of the global problem which is the road crashes, both predictable and
preventable phenomena (Sy K., April 2017). That is why Garret Morgan and
J.P Knight invented the traffic light to improve and facilitate the safe movement

: ; <n at j ired to
of automobiles and avoid collisions. Individuals who owns a car is requl
attend a seminar and driving lessons before they can acquire their driving
license. Also, there are several topics that tackles about safety driving on the
intemet that can actually help vehicle drivers drive and get those people on
board safe and sound. Safety should always be the vehicular drivers’ primary
concems when they are driving especially when they are with their families and
friends or transporting passengers or children to their respective school or
destination.

Even having enough knowledge about safe driving and no matter how
careful those drivers drove their vehicles; accidents still insist to occur. Some
statistics have shown that the majority of road accidents usually happen
because of human error and sixty percent (60%) of these could've have been
evaded if only the driver had been notified a bit earlier (Watteyne T., March
2018). The few human errors are namely; the other driver didn’t see that they
were at a four-way stop and ignored the stop sign, a vehicle is attempting to
turn right off a single carriageway, while a vehicle behind is attempting to
overtake, someone missed the red light or didn't see the stop sign on the road
and poorly designed roads or intersections (Tario M., April 2017). Whatever the

cause of the accident, the results are almost always the same which is injury or

worse — death.
Since these accidents can be preventable, the proponents came up with

the idea of developing a vehicle to vehicle communication for automobile

collision avoidance using ad-hoc network. A device which will enable vehicle

drivers to communicate with each other by sending and exchanging data such

as the vehicle speed, predefined messages, the current location of the vehicle

which will become a guide to help avoid a potential collision.

"PHONE SECURITY ANDROID APPLICATION
","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The proponents have decided to develop an android phone
security application that could help mitigate the increasing number of missing
phones. The descriptive method of research was used in this study. Surveys
and interviews were conducted in order to know their experiences in losing their
smartphones. The developed application is basically a mobile application which
the user can monitor their phone if their phone is in lost mode with the help of
the features that the developer implemented. One of the objective of this study

is to develop the features in tracing and protecting your android smartphones if
ever it is stolen or gone missing and in longer term will help mitigate phone
missing cases. This will also give benefits to the users because it will somehow
lessen their worries in losing their smartphones. The proponents use a Global
Positioning System (GPS) and Google Map in their application for tracking the
lost phone and monitor it with another devices where it is registered as a backup
phone. The Proponents choose Android Operating System (aOS) in developing
the project for it has a great number people using this mobile operating system
and it is always on demand in every marketplace. The development of this
project is patterned with the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Agile

Approach. The proponents used the agile as a guide to get their goals and to

have an effective and efficient mobile application.

1.1 Introduction

As of early 2013, 56 percent of American adults owned smart phones,
and by the end of 2014, there were nearly 7 billions mobile cellular
subscribers worldwide. We believe it is inevitable that these devices will
become the primary portals by which humans interact with services, including
remote services (e.g. banking) and more local ones (e.g. Automatic Teller
Machines) (Libonati, A., et al., 2014). Because these devices are vulnerable
to theft, security of this data is put at higher risk-once the attacker is in
physical possession of the device, recovering these credentials and
impersonating the owner of the phone is hard to defend by purely local
means. (Caine, K., et al., 2014). Global Position System (GPS) is a
technology where satellites send down radio signals. In utilizing this
technology, user can locate the exact address of the thief. (Danu, R. 2016).
This application uses the latest technology like Short Message Services;
(SMS) through using it, you can track theft's current location IMSI number

changed. (Kumar, R. V., et al., 2015). A number of researchers are being held

on the issue of obtaining private information on Android devices using

multimedia such as microphones and cameras. One of the issues is basic

camera attack model. This kind of attack will capture image secretly from

Android device camera without getting known to user. We will use this
disadvantage in a positive direction to control device and collect information

from device remotely. (Chouhan, J. G., et al., 2016).

Seeing many of these missing cases, we tried to develop a system for
tracking and securing a missing phone. (Krisitan, Y et al., 2013). With an
increasing number of organizations allowing personal smart phones onto their
networks, considerable security risk was introduced. The security risk is
exacerbated by the tremendous heterogeneity of the personal mobile devices
and their respective installed pool of applications. (Van Bruggen, D., et al.,
2013). It's not the device itself that's so valuable to those victims, but the data
stored on those smartphones, as Lookout notes. This includes anything from
photos to videos, contacts, music, apps, and banking information. The survey
also found that 44% of smartphones were stolen because owners had
forgotten them in a public setting, and 14% of devices were taken from a car

or house that was burglarized. Only 11% of victims had their smartphone

stolen off personally. (Eadicicco, L. 2014).

Though there are some android phone theft application that already
existed such as Android Device Manager, these applications can easily be by-
passed and rendered useless once the thief perform a factory reset on the
phone. This would turn the phone fresh as a new device. And also, these
applications heavily relies on Internet/Wi-Fi services alone and as such, if
there's no connection available to the device, these application wouldn't

properly execute their functions that could potentially help track/ocate the
stolen ph i
phone. In some instances, the thief would pull out the phone SIM card

which would make tracking even more difficult.

In response to the abovementioned problems, the proponents have
decided to develop an android phone security application that could help
mitigate the increasing number of missing phones. The features that were
implemented to the application is locating the current location of the phone
through Global Positioning System (GPS) and Short Messages Service (SMS)
as a trigger and it also has a feature that could capture the image of the thief.
When the SIM card is ejected from the phone, the application will
automatically acquire the new number of the phone and it will send the
information back to the tracker. The owner of the phone can send a trigger to
record the activity of the thief through audio recording, send a copy of SMS
conversation, and even call logs. The proponents took a counter measure in
response to the wiping of data through factory reset by rooting the phone and

converting the application to be recognized as a system app so that it can no

longer be uninstalled.

INTRODUCTION

4.1 Rationale of the Study

Most of aquaculture industries, manual water monitoring has been
employed, the aquaculture farms normally perform their daily physical
monitoring on fishponds. The fisherman needs to manually observe the water
condition of the fishpond, this activity is time consuming and it lacks automated
alert system for the fisherman. Agusan River Basin was in the northeastern part
of Mindanao that passes mainly through three provinces in Region XI and
Caraga. When the rainy season comes, Agusan River would be filled with water
and would overflow in which it can affect their fishponds in Agusan del Norte.
According to Escobido J. et al. (2019, September 15) the fisher folks of Agusan
del Norte can predict the water level of Agusan del Norte, by means of the
predictions of high tide, low tide of the calendar, however, in terms of monitoring
the water level on their prediction is not always accurate because when there
is a heavy rain the water level arises and cause overflowing and bursting to
open dike of the fishponds. Also, fisher folks manually check the water quality
of the fishpond and can’t assure that the water is not polluted because when
there is a heavy rain the water from the polluted area will go straight to the
fishponds and pollutes the area. By then, they will monitor the fishpond water
quality by checking manually the entire fishpond if there are dead fishes or
prawns floating in the said area and lead their conclusion that the water of the
fishpond is polluted. As mentioned by Kayalvizhi et al. (2015), the problem also
related to the requirement of manpower to perform manual activities and need

to be minimized, the proponents also developed a monitoring system. Based
on this matter, the proponents decided to conduct research and studies which

leads them to create a system for monitoring fishpond with notification

component.

Therefore, the proponents decided to develop a system for monitoring
fish pond with notification component that would frequently monitored in the
water level of the fishpond and give warnings when the water level arises using
different kinds of sensors and to develop a system that store and retrieve data.
If the water level of the fishpond arises to its standard level, the system would
automatically send an SMS to the fisherman containing the water level of the
fishpond, temperature and its pH level. Through this, it would be useful to
observe the water level and monitor water parameters; temperature, pH, and

the water level if it is well-balanced in order to ensure the fish health, growth

and survival.
1.2 Project Context

Agusan River Basin was in the northeastern part of Mindanao that
passes mainly through three provinces in Region XI and Caraga. When the
rainy season comes, Agusan River would be filled with water and it would
overflow causing water arises that can affect a certain area in Agusan del Norte-
which is the Municipality of Magallanes and Butuan City where fishponds are
mostly located because of its brackish water. And also where the proponents
randomly pick the respondents to differentiate and get its common problem in
monitoring fishponds on their area. The proponents concluded that the common
problem of monitoring fishpond is the suddenly arising of water level without

having a frequently update of the water level. The fisher folks are the main
beneficiaries of the developed project. Mainly the people of the community of

Agusan del Norte would be benefited to the study.

The proponents developed a project entitled “A system for monitoring
fishpond with Notification Component” that monitors the water level,
temperature and pH level, these parameters have its own optimum level which
is the normal range, if these parameters are triggered this would automatically
send an SMS Notification whenever the water level arises which exceed to its
optimum level, also the same with the other water parameters. The developed
project would help the fisher folks to have an update about the status of the
fishpond water level, temperature, and its pH level. The developed system can

measure the following parameters: the temperature, water level, and pH level

of the fishpond.
The system developed by the proponents are using the Raspberry Pi3;

Python Web Interface as front-end, and SQLite as the database.

"A MICRO CONTROLLER-BASED PEDESTRIAN LANE RECOGNITION

SYSTEM THROUGH IMAGE PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY WITH VEHICULAR
MOTION CONTROL
","ABSTRACT

Pedestrian road crossings have become a major issue in road
accidents, especially in urban areas where the issue of control exists. To
improve the mobility between the drivers and the cross walkers, a pedestrian
lane recognition system is necessary. Pedestrian awareness is essential for
improving road safety. Hence, the proponents came up with the idea of
pedestrian recognition system aimed to recognize the presence of pedestrian
lane and automatically performs motion control to stop whenever an obstacle
or a person crossing is detected. The purpose of this report is to provide an
overview of research studies on pedestrian safety. Raspberry Pi camera
module using the method of color thresholding is used for image processing
and classifying image as pedestrian lane or not. This identifies two-
dimensional images using RGB color model that will recognize the color
preferred by the user in the camera recognition and ultrasonic sensor. The
proponents made an analysis of the peculiarities of the task of surveillance for
pedestrian crossings and presented a pedestrian recognition system. A
thorough investigation was performed on a test image in order to validate the
system's effectiveness. The efficiency of the system is affected by real-time
processing and the error rate of recognition. In general, the system helps the
people and the drivers to cross pedestrian lane in a well-organized and more

secure way.

INTRODUCTION

1.1Rationale of the Study
Pedestrian detection has been a focus of recent research due to its
importance for practical applications such as automotive safety and visual
surveillance. The essential role of machine vision modules to realize active
safety systems for accident prevention is clearly established in academic
research and is also reflected in innovative systems introduced by industry
(K. Sri, K. Aditya, 2013). It has driven the importance of having pedestrian
lane recognition as part of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)
that are developed to automate, adapt, and enhance vehicle systems for
safety and better driving. With the progress of urbanization, there has
been a great increase in urban population density and traffic
infrastructures. Pedestrian crossing, as an important part of transportation
infrastructures, serves to secure pedestrians’ lives and possessions and
keep traffic flow in order (Pedestrian Lane, 2016).

As a part of important efforts in safety precautions to prevent road
traffic injuries, vehicular collisions and like other road traffic crashes,
pedestrian lane is a road infrastructure set as an indicator to the drivers to
slow down or to reduce its speed and volume (Visually Separated
Pedestrian Lane, 2009). In terms of quantifying the accident rate
depending on the type of transportation, pedestrians, who account for 41%
of the total number of victims, represent the largest number of traffic

accident victims in terms of deaths. It is well known that human errors are
the causes of most traffic accidents. The two main errors are drivers’

inattention and wrong driving decisions (Basam Musleh, 2010).

In the evident side along the pedestrian accidents, it initiates the
problem that every public commuter experience. From 2005 up to August
14, 2015, there were 57,877 people of whom 1,859 or 3.2% were killed,
while 56,018 or 96.7% were injured relating to the misuse of pedestrians
in Metro Manila roads. This could be translated that every pedestrian
causes one casualty and 30 injuries. A pedestrian is defined as a person
who is travelling on foot and not riding a vehicle (Thinking Machines Data
Science Inc. , 2015). Driver attitude is a main key risk. Driver behavior
particularly in terms of respect for other road users was expressed by

those surveyed while drinking and driving is cited by the World Health

Organization.

This leads the proponents to come up with a study on a micro
controller-based pedestrian lane recognition system through image
processing technology with vehicular motion control. It is a real-time
pedestrian recognition incorporating the concept of a pedestrian lane
detection system embedding image processing technology for vehicular

motion control.

1.2 Project Context
Vision-based systems have been proposed to deal with crosswalk
recognition, or more in general urban road markings recognition, for
different purposes. Many studies have been done to design warning
systems. The proponents will construct a vehicular prototype that triggers

its motion control and recognizes pedestrian lane alongside to a process
that perceives pedestrian lane (Zebra Crosswalks) in the road through an

OpenCV, a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision.

The essential design of the prototype will cater the proponent concept in
adapting the one-way road project in DPWH concept. The proponent
ensures that it already meets the main hardware requirements like a
Microcontroller (Raspberry Pl), Pi Camera, HC-S04 (Ultra Sonic Sensor).
The proponents — will develop a pedestrian lane detection system

embedding image processing technology for vehicular motion control. The

prototype has an integrated camera (Pi Camera) that is used for

recognizing pedestrian lane and if the camera recognizes it, the motion
control will take over to decelerate its speed. The proponents initiate the
concept of pedestrian detection when the vehicle moves toward pedestrian
lane (Zebra Crosswalks) section with the given distance of 50 centimeters
away from vehicle, the vehicle will decelerate its speed in just 3.3
centimeters. The vehicle will instantiate to Stop whenever the sensor
detects a person walking on the pedestrian lane which ultrasonic sensor

will be catered alongside to its proximate distance of 30 centimeters of the
vehicle to the Person detected.

This mobile based application is created to modernized the flow of fare
etiquette of every bus commuter. This will help not just the bus passengers
but also the conductors and admin in making their work more secure and
fast. The developed application is highly acceptable and efficient to users.
The researchers conclude that with the use of PayAppBus- A Cashless
Payment Transaction Application for Bus Commuters using Mobile Load
Balance through Location-Based Dynamic Fare Computation would make
the transaction more efficient inside the bus station, reliable and advanced
compared to the current manual processing of fare transaction.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study
Bus is a means of transportation for short or long distance travelled.

Public busses are most common transportation for mass commuters.
According to Tavilla (Tavilla, 2015) Many commuters travel daily on multiple
modes of mass transit operated by different agencies with separate fare
collection systems that enables fare payments and trip planning across
regional transit systems and transportation. Therefore, bus is very important
for any commuters. Today, the means of payment specially on travelling are
in cash. According to Garcia et.al.,(Garcia, 2006) Monetary bills have been
launched into trade markets, and became one of the modes of payment up
to present. This means that it signifies the importance of cash especially
when you are on travel, riding buses or any kind of public vehicle.

According to John Belda (John Belda et al., 2015) Public utility
buses in the Philippines used one methods of payment process. The manual
payment method, in which the conductor uses puncher to release tickets for
the passenger. The significance of cash payment on buses holds some
issues and problems. According to Crisobal et.al., (Cristobal, 2018). Public
utility buses are the most commonly used vehicle in a long distance journey
passing through provincial and national roads. Problems in bus transactions
are being encountered. Usually, the passengers do not have exact amount
in paying bus fares and the conductors"" method of collection is time-

consuming. As money has been invented, fraud and volume payment
became an issue, It is also supported by the statement of John Belda, M. M
et.al.,(John Belda et al., 2015) Commonly mass of people used public
vehicle for it can travel in a much longer distance than any other
transportation vehicles using money that serves as payment.
Aside of money issues, giving money change is time-consuming.
Some bus operators tend to calculate the amount of fare with the given
kilometer and sometimes, inaccurate. Passengers have an exact amount of
money to pay for the bus fare and what they have to do is to wait for the
conductors change. According to Tirachini (Tirachini, 2013). Using the
estimated boarding and alighting average times, performance comparisons
are simulated assuming a service with payment outside buses validation
inside buses and cash transactions. In particular, that substantial time
savings are accruable if payment methods are upgraded from slow
techniques, such as cash transactions to the fastest while intermediate
technologies such as prepaid cards validated inside buses fall in between.
Therefore, the researchers come up with the idea of enhancing the
methods of paying fares in the bus by using an Android device and an
electronic QR code reading device which will be used by the conductors to
accumulate the passenger's fares. This payment method will be used both
the QR code reading device and Android technology. According to Crisobal
et.al., (Cristobal, 2018) Cashless transaction is one where the payment is
made by means other than physical cash. (Gupta, 2017) The rise of cashless
transaction is due to emerging trends driven by consumer's preference,
convenience and efficiency in transacting. (Ahmed, 2016) The concept of

cashless transaction system emerged in the nineteenth century.
1.2 Project Context
According to Cristobal et.al.,(Cristobal, 2018) Public Bus

Transportation is most used service among the people of various regions
such as rural, urban and metro cites. Starting from students to working
professionals are utilizing the bus transport due to its availability on time,
multiple routes across cities and schedule basis. Due to demand in bus
transport among public both government and private sectors are providing
much facilities for passengers to make comfort travelling. Though luxury field
improved, but the ticketing system is still cash pay to buy a ticket in bus
transport. Since online bookings are only done for long distance transports,
the city buses are still suffering with a problem with cash payment due to
scarcity of coins.

There will be a quarrel and issues among the bus conductor and
Passengers for not having returned the exact amount of money given by the
passengers. This problem is still occurring in day to day cases that affects
the harmony of the society. So the main theme of this project is to eradicate
the problem due to demands of coin change in public bus transport and

implementation of simple method of transaction.

"AN IMPLEMENTATION OF TESDA COMPETENCY- BASED TRAINING
DELIVERY TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
","ABSTRACT

An Implementation of TESDA Competency Based Training Delivery
Transaction Management System has been prepared by the proponents to
help TESDA Provincial Office on monitoring their trainers and trainee to
ensure that their trainers are doing their job accordingly. The study focused on
monitoring the trainers and trainees by means of using charts and notifying
the Provincial Office when a sudden activity has been done by the trainers
and trainees such as answering the Pre-test and Post-test. Furthermore,
automatic changes have been implemented into its charts and also if given a
change this is the first system to be used and implemented on TESDA for
monitoring their trainers and trainees. During the development the proponents

used System Development Life Cycle (SDLC), this method was very useful on

identifying errors. The proponents used python and flask to connect on the
webpage with the side server data which is MySQL database. Python flask is
easy to call the template from the website which passed through the host and
URL to ensure the software quality, the proponents conducted a survey result
and got the result of 4.225. The result proves that the software is indeed
useful and helpful on monitoring TESDA Provincial office trainers and
trainees. Also using this system eliminates manual way of monitoring their
trainees and trainers and can rest assured that their trainers are doing their
job accordingly. The system also helps to all trainers to do work paperless
and send the data automatically to generate record of a certain trainees.

","INTRODUCTION

In this chapter are the rationale of the study, project context, purpose

and description, objectives of the study, scope and limitation.

1.1 Rationale of the Study

Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) was
established through the enactment of Republic Act. No. 7796, empowers
TESDA to establish and maintain a system of accrediting, coordinating,
integrating, monitoring and evaluating formal and non-formal technical
vocational education and training programs. The National Certificate, is an
important document needed to present in applying jobs here and abroad, it is
a graduate’s proof that her or she has passed all the trainings and

requirements set by the TESDA.

The TESDA Director Guiling Mamondiong in the year 2017 said that they
conducted inspection of training centers and they found out that sometimes
they are just sending their substitutes to train the students. Aside from that,
the assessors and trainers are being pirated by other departments. Based on
this matter the proponents decided to conduct a research and studies which
leads them to create the An Implementation of TESDA Competency-Based

Training Delivery Transaction Management System.

The training of TESDA has been managed and they conducted a

registration for the trainees and trainers. The trainers can monitor his or her
trainees all the time but they cannot monitor on time which of those trainees

are behind and need of their attention.

Therefore, the proponents’ decided to develop An Implementation of
TESDA Competency-Based Training Delivery Transaction Management
System to give them an easy way to manage their trainers and trainees. They
can managed who is that trainee that have been left behind and what part of
the Unit Competency (UC) were they consumed so much time. The system
can auto generate the other works of the trainers like checking directly the

achievement charts and the progress chart instead of manual.

1.2 Project Context

The assessment of TESDA is important for graduates as it is where they
could get a national certificate (NC) if they passed. Most of assessment in this
institution used a manual process when it comes to monitor a trainee, to
check their achievement chart, progress chart and the daily training matrix

and also to manually do their pre-test and post-test.

In order to manage An Implementation of TESDA Competency-Based
Training Delivery Transaction Management System was developed to

automate the system so that the trainer can focus the trainees. The said

system can easily monitor both trainees and the trainer. Also, the said system

can automatically check the achievement chart and the progress chart if the

trainee done with their job. The said system can give them the access to do

their pre-test and post-test on time. The office of TESDA can also monitor the

trainer and the trainees.
The trainees can read or answer the question like a pre-test and post-test
by Unit Competency (UC). The trainee cannot skip a chapter without finishing
by its module. Since the other chapter is unavailable unless the trainees read

the first chapter. The trainees cannot proceed if the trainer didn’t validate their

work in the first place.

An Implementation of TESDA Competency-Based Training Delivery
Transaction Management System was developed by the proponents to help
the trainer to be informed and can monitor their trainees’ progress. If the
trainees’ done with their work, the achievement chart will automatically be
checked and also the progress chart. The used of automation of the CBT is
mainly used for monitoring the activities of the trainees’ and the trainer. Also,

to ensure that the trainers doing their job according to avoid training ghosting.

The proposed system was developed by the proponents using python,

flask and MySQL.

"MEASURING THE LEVEL OF THE AMMONIA GAS IN A COMFORT ROOM
WITH FLUSHING MECHANISM ACTIVATION AND NOTIFICATION
FEATURES USING RASPBERRY PI
","ABSTRACT

This study is about Measuring the Level of Ammonia Gas in a Comfort Room
with Flushing Mechanism Activation and Notification Features using
Raspberry Pi. The study was conducted with the purpose of maintaining the
sanitary condition of the comfort room and eliminating foul smell of urine, to
save water, energy and to minimize the work of the utility workers. The
researchers of the study developed a prototype that can detect if the level of
ammonia gas in the comfort room is high and will automatically flush the toilet
bowl, send a notification to the cleaners that the comfort room is in need of
cleaning; the exhaust fan will turn on automatically for 5 minutes only and will
automatically turn off. The air freshener will automatically turn on after the
exhaust fan is off and it will spray for at least 3 minutes. The newly developed
system must be evaluated in terms of functionality, reliability, efficiency and
usability. By using the Waterfall Development Model Methodology, the
prototype was developed and implemented into a hardware output that would
benefit different establishments and its utility workers. The prototype used
technologies such as Raspberry Pi 3, MQ137 Ammonia Gas Sensor, Exhaust
Fan, Air Freshener and Servo Motor for mechanical control of the toilet bowl’s
flush. In addition, the prototype integrated mobile application for receiving
notification via internet. The study had reached its purpose and main
objectives. The researchers concluded that the developed system was
acceptable in accordance to the ISO/IEC Software Quality Test.

INTRODUCTION

Found in this chapter are the rationale of the study, project context, the
objectives of the study and the scopes and limitations.

1.1 Rationale of the Study

Every establishment such as malls, fast food chains, restaurants,
hospitals and schools have comfort rooms. In places like this, every day
different people use the toilet for excretion of waste or to urinate. However,
shared facilities were not recognized as improved sanitation due to challenges
of maintenance (Cairncross et. al., 2017). Though public washrooms have
janitors for cleaning, management depends on the users. If users do not work
collectively towards keeping the facility clean, it is likely that the quality may

depreciate due to lack of maintenance (Rheingans et. al, 2017).

According to Air-Scent, 2017, the common source of bad odor in
comfort room is urine. The warm, acidic fluid is an excellent food source of
odor-causing bacteria and as they multiply, so does the intensity of odor.
Urine is a waste produced in the kidneys that filters out harmful elements. It
also contains various salts, carbohydrates, and fatty acids, trace amounts of
hormones, nitrogen and urea. Bacteria feed on protein, urea and
carbohydrates which create other byproduct called hydrogen sulfide and
various ammonia compounds, which are offensive to our nostrils. Due to poor
ventilation in public washroom, ammonia smell stinks (Banerjee, 2016). The
New York Department of Health describes ammonia gas as a colorless,

alkaline gas comprised of nitrogen and hydrogen (NH3) that has a strong
odor. However, ammonia found in urine is actually urea, which is a processed
-toxic. Even

form of ammonia, and carbon dioxide in the liver and it is non

though it is non-toxic ammonia smells bad in a comfort room it is because
overly rated exhausts fans is also one of the reason why the smell of
ammonia in the comfort room worsen. Since rest rooms have tightly closed
doors and windows, no fresh air suction or entry is possible and in such
scenario, the exhaust system tends to pull out gasses from drain (Banerjee,

2016). Aside from regular and thorough cleanings, restroom can be equipped

with a device and other tools to ensure a healthy and clean experience.
To address this problem, the researchers developed a study on
Measuring the Level of Ammonia Gas in a Comfort Room with Flushing
Mechanism Activation and Notification Features Using Raspberry Pi. The
developed project can sense and measure the level of ammonia gas present
in the comfort room. It will automatically turn on/off the exhaust fan then spray
an air freshener. It will also activate the flush that automatically flush the toilet

bowls. It can also send a notification to the cleaner if the comfort room is in

need of cleaning.

"VEHICULAR LOCKING SYSTEM WITH REAL-TIME LOCATION
MONITORING USING GPS AND ARDUINO
","Abstract

Vehicular Locking System with Real-Time Location Monitoring using
GPS and Arduino has been developed to give locking system and monitoring
system and to help the vehicular owners in Butuan City because of the fast-
growing populating of vehicle owners. This study focuses on locking,
monitoring and give messaging command (via SMS) that communicate with
the vehicular owner to update the vehicle owners from theft or unwanted
access to the vehicle. Furthermore, an inquiry was also included in this study
to become more interactive wherein individuals in the community could
inquire the actual vehicle status and the owners can also turn on and off the
SMS notification alert through SMS keyword. The vehicle can be monitored
through the web application. Using the System Development Life Cycle
(SDLC) as a method in making the software was very useful and helpful in
identifying errors during the development. The following technologies like
Arduino Uno, GSM and Buzzer are used in making the prototype. The
proponents conducted a survey for the software quality of the system to the
vehicular owners and was highly acceptable based on the total mean
obtained of 4.1956. The prototype was indeed useful to the vehicular owners
because it helps them to monitor the vehicle in the situation if someone else’s
in the family used it. This eliminates the manual way of locating the vehicle
real-time and late receiving of SMS warning of the vehicular owners. It was
relevant and important as per the needs for safety and welfare of the

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study
Car vehicle is one of the most valued possessions nowadays and having
one of this in the Philippines most specially to ordinary company employee is
very difficult to become a reality and losing it is really a cruel imagination if it
happens. Therefore, looking for other means of securing cars from theft using
the present technology (Laguador, J.M., et al 2013).
In recent years theft has been seriously increased and there is no safety
for people and their properties. Security plays a vital role in monitoring a
building in the absence or presence of people. Theft refers to the crime
involving the taking of a person’s property without their permission. Most of the
theft happens by door break-ins. 75% of theft occurs during night time. The thief
may take off the fuse, so they cannot be easily identified and if they caught,
they can be easily escaped (Deepika, S. et al, 2015).

Based in Camp Crame, January 5 to September 6, 214 vehicles were
stolen on the streets while 140 forcibly taken from their owners in residential
areas (villages and subdivisions). These represent 44% and 29%, respectively,
of a total of 489 reported carnapping cases. With Directorate for Investigation
and Detective Management (DIDM) records that show 64% of Carnapping
incidents during said period happened between 12:01 and 8: 00 in the morning

(Gonzales, S., 2015),

With the fast-growing population of vehicle owners, it is difficult to locate

one fo others manually. With the help of a vehicular locking system with real-
time location monitoring using GPS and Arduino, it presents an easy way of
tracking the vehicle speed and location. It also provides remote access to the
vehicle that the owner has the privilege to stop the vehicle when it will be stolen
and activating the emergency alarm by SMS.

GPS, or the Global Positioning System, is a global navigation satellite
system that uses at least 24 satellites, a receiver and algorithms to provide
location, velocity and time synchronization for air, sea and land travel. The
satellite system consists of six earth-centered orbital planes, each with four
satellites. GPS works at all times and in almost all weather conditions. This post
answers “What is GPS?” and explains how it works. In general, there are five
key uses of GPS: Location, Navigation, Tracking, Mapping, and Timing. (Keyes
J. et al, 2017)

Meanwhile, Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on
easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs -
light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message and turn it into an
output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online.
You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the
microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming
language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on
Processing.

Thus, the combination of GPS using Arduino, is relevant to create a tool
in which every vehicular user can use as a locator of the vehicles. With this, it
Can allow you to get a real-time view of the position, route, and time of travel in

any vehicle, allowing you to get an understanding of the location of any vehicle

in your fleet, no matter how big or how small. In addition to these features, the
proponents aim to include the remote feature of the system in which the user
can remotely stop the vehicle in case of an unauthorized user of the vehicle.

Hence, the study aimed to provide a solution to the problem concerning the

rampant vehicle theft on the community.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

Artificial Intelligence is an area of computer science that deals with the
ability to mimic the human brain. Al systems typically demonstrate some
behaviors associated with human intelligence such as planning, learning,
reasoning, problem solving, knowledge representation, perception, motion, and
manipulation. Artificial Intelligence must access its relations, objects,
categories and properties in order to implement the knowledge engine of an
Expert System (Techpedia, 2019).

Chatbot is an automated messaging software which also uses artificial
intelligence (Al) in conversing with people. There are various expert system
and chatbots were created but some of it are not free to access. Users’
messages containing pediatric concerns can be simply recognize through an
expert system chatbot.

Pediatrics is a branch of medicine that involves medical care of infants,
children, and adolescents. Pediatrics treats and diagnoses conditions among
children such as infections and developmental-behavioral disorder (Mandal,
2019).

A pediatric chatbot that uses artificial intelligence in conversing with
people can be useful in this technological era. In order to cater messages from

the users, chatbots are programmed to understand questions, provide answers,

and execute tasks that resembles speaking to a real person (Cooper, 2019).
Parents lack in knowledge on handling pediatric problems which lead
them to having difficulties in dealing their situation. Parent's availability of time
and money lead them on having inconvenience to get an expert to handle their
concerns. With these inconvenience and lack of knowledge, they cannot
simply find answers, suggestions and remedies with regards to handling
pediatric concems.

DrPedia is a Facebook Messenger Chatbot that caters ten pediatric
ilInesses. Users can now send their pediatric problems through DrPedia.
DrPedia will process their concerns with the use of Backward Chaining and
Deep Learning Algorithm to cater users messages. Users can receive
suggestions and recommendations based on the matter that they relay to

DrPedia. DrPedia is free to access due to the availability and accessibility of

vastly used Facebook Messenger.

1.2 Project Context

Pediatricians examine children regularly to assess their growth and
development. Pediatricians also collect, record and maintain patient
information such as medical history, reports, or examination results. Chatbots
have been around for decades and currently they exist on web pages, mobile
application and social media. Artificial intelligence becomes a huge part of
technological industry that helps a lot of technology platforms.

The proponents came up with the study called DrPedia, an expert
system that caters ten common pediatric illnesses, which are Gastroenteritis,
Dengue, Urinary Tract Infection (UTI), Tonsillitis, FLU or Influenza, Common

Cold, Typhoid Fever, Bronchitis, Pneumonia, and Diarrhea. DrPedia uses

","INTRODUCTION

4.1 Rationale of the Study

Most of aquaculture industries, manual water monitoring has been
employed, the aquaculture farms normally perform their daily physical
monitoring on fishponds. The fisherman needs to manually observe the water
condition of the fishpond, this activity is time consuming and it lacks automated
alert system for the fisherman. Agusan River Basin was in the northeastern part
of Mindanao that passes mainly through three provinces in Region XI and
Caraga. When the rainy season comes, Agusan River would be filled with water
and would overflow in which it can affect their fishponds in Agusan del Norte.
According to Escobido J. et al. (2019, September 15) the fisher folks of Agusan
del Norte can predict the water level of Agusan del Norte, by means of the
predictions of high tide, low tide of the calendar, however, in terms of monitoring
the water level on their prediction is not always accurate because when there
is a heavy rain the water level arises and cause overflowing and bursting to

open dike of the fishponds. Also, fisher folks manually check the water quality
of the fishpond and can’t assure that the water is not polluted because when
there is a heavy rain the water from the polluted area will go straight to the
fishponds and pollutes the area. By then, they will monitor the fishpond water
quality by checking manually the entire fishpond if there are dead fishes or
prawns floating in the said area and lead their conclusion that the water of the
fishpond is polluted. As mentioned by Kayalvizhi et al. (2015), the problem also
related to the requirement of manpower to perform manual activities and need

to be minimized, the proponents also developed a monitoring system. Based
on this matter, the proponents decided to conduct research and studies which
leads them to create a system for monitoring fishpond with notification

component.
Therefore, the proponents decided to develop a system for monitoring

fish pond with notification component that would frequently monitored in the

water level of the fishpond and give warnings when the water level arises using

different kinds of sensors and to develop a system that store and retrieve data.

If the water level of the fishpond arises to its standard level, the system would
automatically send an SMS to the fisherman containing the water level of the
fishpond, temperature and its pH level. Through this, it would be useful to
observe the water level and monitor water parameters; temperature, pH, and
the water level if it is well-balanced in order to ensure the fish health, growth
and survival.

1.2 Project Context

Agusan River Basin was in the northeastern part of Mindanao that

passes mainly through three provinces in Region XI and Caraga. When the
rainy season comes, Agusan River would be filled with water and it would
overflow causing water arises that can affect a certain area in Agusan del Norte-
which is the Municipality of Magallanes and Butuan City where fishponds are
mostly located because of its brackish water. And also where the proponents
randomly pick the respondents to differentiate and get its common problem in
monitoring fishponds on their area. The proponents concluded that the common
problem of monitoring fishpond is the suddenly arising of water level without

having a frequently update of the water level. The fisher folks are the main
beneficiaries of the developed project. Mainly the people of the community of

Agusan del Norte would be benefited to the study.

The proponents developed a project entitled “A system for monitoring
fishpond with Notification Component” that monitors the water level,
temperature and pH level, these parameters have its own optimum level which
is the normal range, if these parameters are triggered this would automatically
send an SMS Notification whenever the water level arises which exceed to its
optimum level, also the same with the other water parameters. The developed
project would help the fisher folks to have an update about the status of the
fishpond water level, temperature, and its pH level. The developed system can
measure the following parameters: the temperature, water level, and pH level

of the fishpond.

The system developed by the proponents are using the Raspberry Pi 3,
Python Web Interface as front-end, and SQLite as the database.

INTRODUCTION

4.1 Rationale of the Study

Philippines is ranked third in the 2018 World Risk Index of most disaster-
prone countries in the world. The country experiences almost all forms of
disasters such as typhoons, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions with
numerous complex emergencies due to armed conflict (United Nations
Populations Fund Philippines or UNPFA, 2018). When these disasters happen,
residents from the affected areas are relocated to an evacuation center. The
local government then monitors the evacuees to effectively manage and
provide resources for every individual (Allison G. S. Knox, 2016).

On November 8, 2013, over 30,000 people in the Philippines were
affected by typhoon Haiyan also known as super typhoon Yolanda. Putting their
lives to safety has been the main priority of the government during the
catastrophic event (National Disaster Risk Reduction Management statistics,
2014). According to Joseph Marconi C. Agustin, City Social Welfare and
Development Division Head (2019), it is important for them to keep (a) record
of the evacuees to monitor their situation and know the accurate numbers of
household members for them to provide the necessary assistance. Based on
the statement of Barangay Kagawad Juliet D. Conception from barangay Baan
(2019), manual evacuee registration and interview are conducted upon the
arrival. These processes are necessary, not just for monitoring but also to know
if there are missing person in the household. Once a person is confirmed

missi :
lssing, assigned personnel in the evacuation center will contact the City
Disaster Risk Reduction Management Office or CDRRMO to conduct a search
and rescue operation (Kristin Kay B. Toralba CORRMO, 2019).

According to Juliet D. Conception trom barangay Baan (2019), at
present, the government is still using a paper-based registration system for
evacuee monitoring. In Barangay Baan, Butuan City, the residents need to fill-
up a form that contains personal information and numbers of household
members. However, there are many things that need to be considered when it
comes to the manual registration of evacuees. One of which is the fact that
many people during these moments are still unsettled. A study by Brandon
Brewer (2018) states that, when a person experience disaster, this experience
can lead to trauma and he/she may avoid talking about the event. Another thing
to put in consideration are the children, elderly and the persons with disability.
These old paper-based registration system is cumbersome and error prone that
requires multiple person to person interviews (Mike Geier, 2014).

With the desire of the proponents to improve and help innovate the
current process which is the manual evacuee registration and monitoring, the
proponents intend to develop a system entitled “Evacuee Monitoring System

allying residents into one designated area or building. The barangay
re j
presentatives hand over the list of registered residents to the CSWD. Using

the list
, the CSWD organizes the residents to their designated evacuation
centers and provide ration. The CSWD representatives would keep on

monitoring the evacuees from time to time through asking them if they are
residents of the barangay to avoid getting extra goods to the residents or giving

relief goods to non-residents.

Moreover, rescuers would often contact each other for updates and
confirmations. Their main method of communication would be through radio,
yet this radio communication is only a two-way signal, namely receiver and
sender. Whenever rescuers need to contact other rescuers yet radio lines are
busy, they would most often text or call each other through mobile phones.

The proponents used Python as the main programming language for the
raspberry pi and also the main web programming language for its website
admin extension. The main feature of the system is the raspberry pi equipped
with a pi camera and fingerprint scanner with an LCD screen display.

The system also consists of three main major modules that are assigned
and designated to three type of personnel. First module is the raspberry pi facial
recognition and fingerprint scanner, which is used to identify and verify the
resident that are registered as evacuees in a designated evacuation center. It
is also used to monitor daily attendance and distribution of relief goods for each
family household registered in the designated evacuation center. The second
module is the report generator and message notification service, by which the
system generates a report based on the gathered information, afterward sends
rescuers a list of missing residents and the evacuation center staff can keep a
report of family household members present and missing within the designated
€vacuation center. The third module is the web based administrator server

4.1 Rationale of the Study
Money derives its value by being a medium of exchange, a unit of
measurement and a storehouse for wealth. Payments, salaries and any kind of
business can be involved monetary aspect. According to Campello et.al (2004)
Cash is essential in any kind of payment transaction because it is convenient
and hustle free. According to Reimers et.al (2014) Despite an increasingly
convenience-oriented society, very few empirical studies have identified
convenience as a salient determinant of store patronage. Convenient stores,
retail stores, and public markets are likewise known to be in need of more cash
especially coins. Coin is a small, flat, (usually, depending on the country or
value) round piece of metal or plastic used primarily as a medium of exchange
or legal tender. Coins are made of valuable metal that are stored in large
quantities as bullion coins. Other coins are used as money in everyday

transactions, circulating alongside banknotes.

According to Anant Vijay Kala (Anant Vijay Kala, 201 3) If you’ve shopped
in India you likely know the problem. You go to a store to buy a few things and
when it’s time to pay, you hand over the cash. But the cashier's run out of
change. Instead of the few rupees a monetary unit of India, you’re owed, the

cashier gives you one or two candies, or a stick of chewing gum, to make up
the shortfall.
This is also one of the obvious effects of coin shortage here in the
Philippines, it is the policy of some stores to shortchange customers due
primarily to the fact that shops sometimes resulted to using candies as change.
According to Swathi V. (Swathi V., 2014) Availability of small change has
become a big issue for everybody in the city, with gradually increasing
magnitude. While traders and merchant community has always had a problem

with coin change, now the scarcity is affecting even consumers.

According to Joshi et.al (2016) Coin counting machines have yet to be
fully developed, counting and classifying currency coins with accuracy and high
speed is a challenging problem for banks and stores, and even consumers.
People used to count coins manually, this procedure was not only tedious and

time consuming, but also prone to mistakes.

To ease the issues and problems face on a certain need of the coin, the
researcher proposes a machine that capable of identifying and changing 1000,
500, 200, 100, 50, and 20peso bill to 1, 5, and 10peso coin. A machine is
capable of checking the authenticity of bill and have a free will to choose the

combined coin on exchange.

1.2 Project Context

Bill to Coin Exchanger with Security and Notification Features using
Convolutional Neural Network is a machine that changes bill to any kind of coin
denomination that the user wants. It has the security features which to identify

the authenticity of the bill by its Color and serial number, compared to real peso

use because of coin scarcity. The proponents have foreseen the problem of
people not having enough coins such as in small businesses, jeepney/bus
fares, vending machines and even in department stores. Witnessed long
queues at department store cashier due to lack of coins for change. Using

","INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the study
The Intemet of Things (loT) has been one of the innovative technologies

that helped shape the modern world. It is one of the booming technologies for
the past decades (Alkhatib, Bosua, Buchanan, Waycott, 2018).It has caught the
attention of the big sectors of the society in the fields of business, industry, and
academy. Technically, the Internet of Things (loT) is responsible for
technologically enhancing day to day activities, the creation of Various products
and services in business, and as an inclusive source of research ideas and
topics. Various institutions, enterprises, and government agencies have
recognized its importance and potential benefits that can be acquired in multiple
fields in the society and has driven them to conduct strategic programs and
profitable projects.

Moreover, the Internet of Things-enabled Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) has gained the reputation of being a solution for enhancing road
Safety in smart cities. Due to ever-growing populations, the increasing number
of vehicles in a city willl also results in the rise of the road accidents discovered.
The project aimed at embedding vehicles with a plethora of sensors to monitor
the current situation of the vehicle, it’s surroundings and facilitates the detection

of vehicle-related incidents (Bhatti, et al, 2019).

Butuan City is no stranger with vehicular accidents, due to the ever-

increasing number of accidents in the city, a solution to this manner expected

to be utilized with the Internet of Things-enabled Intelligent Transportation

Systems (ITS). However, the city has not yet aimed at achieving “smartness”
or by improving the technology-based projects, specifically on vehicle-related
fields. Resulting in the ineffectiveness of the Internet of Things-enabled
Intelligent Transportation (ITS) on less advanced cities. With this on-going

problem, an effective solution should be conducted.

1.2 Project Context

The study proposed an efficient technique of eliminating the increase in
the number of roads accident cases caused by the effects of irresponsible
alcohol intake by drivers. Alcohol adversely affects driving-related skills such
as vision, reaction time, judgment and the ability to divide attention to the
affected driver. When a driver is impaired by alcohol to a level that it renders
the drivers capability on driving, this increases the risks of alcohol-related

accidents, commonly vehicle collisions.

The Butuan City Police Station 1 had a tally of 177 motorcycle accidents
from 2016 to the month of April of this year, 62 or 35% of these are reportedly
alcohol-related. More than 9% of motorcycle accidents per year in Butuan City

is alcohol-related, with this gathered data, it is enough to support the purpose

of the study.

Drunk driving is responsible for serious road-related accidents. Even
with a small amount of alcohol intake, drivers are twice likely to be involved in
traffic accidents than sober drivers (Arnedt, et al, 2000). To produce a possible
Solution with regard to this problem, it is beneficial to create a system that
detects the driver's alcohol level and disables the ignition of the engine if the

alcohol .
level exceeds the normal alcohol level. For this reason, the motorcycles
will not be usable, thus, it prevented the driver from drunk-driving and alcohol-

related accidents.
The proponents conducted an interview to 3 motorcycle manufacturers

in the city namely Motortrade Butuan, SKYGO Butuan, and Suzuki Butuan,
regarding with the approval on putting the alcohol detector with engine stopper

in the motorcycle. As a result, 3 out of 3 manufacturers agreed on the idea of

embedding the device in the motorcycle.
To support the relevance of the project, the proponents conducted a

survey with 30 target users of the device. 15 or 75% of the users agreed on
putting an alcohol detector with engine stopper in motorcycles to prevent drunk-
driving. Further results will be discussed in Chapter 4, Results and Discussion.
The proponents aim to decrease alcohol-related accidents. Furthermore,
the proponents plan to develop a prototype module using the Arduino as the
microcontroller, DC Motor that provides rotation to the wheel of the motorcycle
model, Alcohol Sensor Module as the sensor, LCD as the display device,
Passive Buzzer Module as the notifier, the GSM Module as the SMS sender,
and lastly, the 9v battery as the power source of the prototype. Besides, this

study would benefit the people who own a motorcycle who are cautious about

drinking habits that usually lead to alcohol-related accidents.

INTRODUCTION

4.4 Rationale of the Study

At present time, individuals have adjusted in modernization increases in

doing their errands. The day by day substantial outstanding task at hand and

schedules make it hard for individuals to deal with their time. With existing and

advancing innovations these days, from machines to apparatuses and cell

phones, individuals have turned to lead everyday tasks intelligently and

electronically.

The Internet of Things (loT) has been in the spotlight for the past decade. It
is regarded as one of the disruptive technologies of this century and so far, has
caught the attention of society, industry and academy as a Way of
technologically enhancing day to day activities, the creation of new business
models, products and services, and as a broad source of research topics and
ideas. Several alliances, institutions, enterprises and even governments have
understood its importance and identified the potential benefits that can be
obtained from the loT, leading them to undertake strategic projects and

initiatives aiming to develop this field and profit from it (Alkhatib, 2017)

In agricultural matters, having a pig farm business arises many problem.
T ’ .
he manual feeding of pigs was not an easy task to do. To make it easier to the
erso
Person having pig farms, pig monitoring and automated feeding must be

utilized. A pi he
PIg monitoring and automated feeding consist of a hardware that
monitors the pig and automatically refill the feeding place. It also have a mobile

application in order to notify the user.

Therefore, the researcher decided to develop An Automated Pig Feeding

with Depth Analysis using Computer Vision to solve the problem. It has a

prototype that mechanically feed the pigs in the set time and refills the water

automatically along with the computer vision, it is a module that provides the

parameter of the study.
1.2 Project Context

Piggery is a branch of animal husbandry that raises pigs as livestock.
Most of piggery uses manual process when it comes to feeding and monitoring.
Due to a large population of pigs it become more complex to the farmers to
monitor and feed their pigs. As piggery becomes more in demand and as a
source of income nowadays, people become more interested in this kind of
business.

An automated pig feeding with Depth Analysis using Computer Vision is
developed to minimize the workload of the farmer. The system can
automatically feed the pigs and refill its water container. Using OpenCV it can
determine the sizes of the pigs. It can also notify the farmer by sending the

water level data if it is empty and needed to refill.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

Philippines is located above the equator. It lies along the Western Pacific
basin which is considered the world’s busiest typhoon belt. Over the past years,
typhoon is getting stronger and it affects people’s daily lives. It is also the very
reason why it is essential for us to determine what will be the weather for the
next couple of hours. It also plays a vital role in disaster risk reduction and
mitigation (Mercado,2018). The changing properties of losses due to
occurrences of droughts, floods and typhoon disasters a comparatively
economically prosperous in province. Influences of typhoon activities on
droughts and floods are also analyzed. Results based on extensive and
thorough investigations indicate that generally, province is both humid and
warm. However, in recent decades, the negative impacts of droughts seem to
be enhancing, which is proved by increasing drought-induced economic loss

(Zhang et.al, 2010).

The Butuan City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office
(CDRRMO) stated that there are three colors that represent the flood alert level.
First, the color yellow which represents as flood alert level 1 in which it means
that flood and wind are possible. Second, color orange that represents as flood
alert level 2 it signifies Pre-Emptive Evacuation Phase. Third and last is the
color red which represents as flood alert level 3 that signifies Force Evacuation.
The mentioned above are included in the Water Level and Wind Intensity

Protocol, but it is not enough to monitor and help the people living in the affected
area during the flood and wind calamity. People are actually practicing the
dissemination of information status of the water level and wind intensity, but in
the real scenario the messages and information are always late. Once they
receive the messages, the flood and wind are already affecting them and they

already experience difficulty of evacuating.

The Department of Science and Technology Philippine Atmospheric,
Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (DOST-PAGASA)
stated that there are five Public Storm Warning Signal (PSWS) that represents
the wind kilometer per hour (kph). First, PSWS #1 represents as 50-61kph in
which it is expected in 36hrs on 4st issuance it indicates moderate gale to high
risk structure. Second, PSWS #2 represents as 62-74kph itis expected in 24hrs
on 1* issuance it signifies fresh gale to high risk structures. Third, PSWS #3
represents as 75-88kph it is expected in 1 8hrs on 1° issuance it indicates strong
gale to high risk structures. Fourth, PSWS #4 represents as 89-102kph it is
expected in 12hrs on 4st issuance it signifies storm to high risk structures. Fifth,
PSWS #5 represents as more than 403-117kph also expected in 12hrs on 1*

issuance it indicates violent storm to high risk structures.

The proponents found out that the indications mentioned above are not
enough to satisfy the people’s need when it comes to their safety in times of
disasters. They are also worried especially that it includes the lives of their
families and relatives. For this reason, they wanted to achieve a better way of
improving the present condition by creating a prototype device called “Water
Level and Wind Intensity Identification using Microcontroller with Message

Notification Service for Alarm and Warning System”.
4.2 Project Context
Water Level and Wind Intensity Identification using Microcontroller with

Message Notification Service for Alarm and Warning System is a device that

detects the water level and wind intensity identification. It will send a message
notification service the measurement of the water level and to detect the
typhoon threaten specific area for alarm and warning. At the same time, if the
water level arises and wind intensity is critical level people of the affected areas
would receive a message notification service for alarm and warning system.
The said system would accommodate first or prioritized on sending message
notification service for alarm and warning system to the affected residents
before accepting or receiving any messages that has queries regarding with the
water level and wind intensity.

As most people are well aware, the immediate impact of water level and
wind intensity include loss of human life, damage to property, destruction of
crops, loss of livestock, and deterioration of health conditions owing to
waterborne diseases. AS communication links and infrastructures such as
power plants, roads and bridges are damaged and disrupted, some economic

activities may come to a standstill, people are forced to leave their homes and

normal life is disrupted.
Similarly, disruption to industry can lead to loss of livelinoods. Damage

to infrastructure also causes long-term impact, such as disruptions to supplies

of clean water, waste water treatment, electricity, transport, communication,

education and health care. Loss of livelinoods, reduction in purchasing power

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

The World Health Organization (WHO) defined health as a state of
complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the
absence of disease or infirmity (Kuhn, S. & Rieger, U.M., 2017). The
positive concept emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as
physical capacities (Haslam, S. A., & Reynolds, K. J., 2003). This means
that health is a resource to support an individual's function in wider
society (Sharma, M., 2016). A healthful lifestyle that provides the means
to lead a full life (Nordqvist, 2017). More recently, researchers have
defined health as the ability of a body to adapt to new threats and
infirmities (Bhattacharya, N., 2019). They based this the idea on the
modem science that it has dramatically increased human awareness of
diseases and how they work in the last few decades (Nordqvist, 2017).
One of the problems in health is monitoring blood pressure or
hypertension (Barnett, G. O., Winickoff, R. N., Morgan, M. M., & Zielstoff,
R. D., 1983). Blood pressure composed of two types such as systolic
pressure and diastolic pressure (Stamler, J., Stamler, R., & Neaton, J. D.,
4993). The systolic pressure is the force at which the heart pumps blood
around the body. While the diastolic pressure is the resistance of the
blood flow in the blood vessels (Illiades, 2009). A blood pressure reading

between 120/80mmhg and 140/90mmhg could mean you're at risk of
developing high blood pressure (Lloyd Jones, D. M., Larson, M. G.,
Beiser, A., & Levy, D.,1999).

The factors of having a blood pressure includes at the age of 65, being
overweight, have a family of high blood pressure, don’t do enough
exercise, drink too much alcohol or coffee, smoking, and don’t get much
sleep or have disturbed sleep (Monk, 2019). According to Food Nutrition
Research Institute(FNRI), the National prevalence of hypertension among
Filipino adults is 20 years old and over had significantly increased after a
decline in 2013 from 22.3% to 23.9% in 2015 (Aurel, 2018). The
Department of Health (DOH) also revealed that hypertension remains to
be a leading cause of illness and said to be one of the identified
precipitating factors of premature death in the Philippines (Flores, 2018).
In 2017, DOH conducted a current national survey that the total number
of hypertensive Filipinos is more than 12 million with more than half of
them are unaware of their condition and one out of four to five Filipinos in
general (Orillo, 2018). Hypertension is also one of the top causes of
premature deaths worldwide and the problem is growing (Eriksson, H.,
1995). In 2025, the World Health Organization warned that an estimated
4.56 billion adults will be living with hypertension (Agdeppa, 2016). The
traditional way of checking blood pressure is that the doctors use a
sphygmomanometer to take systolic and diastolic measurement, the
phases when the heart pumps blood and then rest (Ormon Healthcare,

2018).
The proponents proposed a system wearable blood pressure
monitoring system using Arduino in generating status report through web
portal access. To be able to monitor and know the patient's status of their
blood pressure and in addition, is to keep them updated to their condition
every day. The user cannot get any hustle when they go outside of their
house since they can wear the device wherever they will go. The relatives
can monitor their patient even the patient is not in their house. Also by the
use of the system, it tracks the current location of the user through global

positioning system or GPS. The primary goal of this study as well is to

communicate information clearly through the use of information applies.

1.2 Project Context

Wearable blood pressure monitoring system using Arduino in
generating status report through web portal access focuses on the
effective and convenient way to monitor the patient. It tends to help the
patient in a very accessible way to provide them good service and to keep
them updated of their status if it is in good condition. When the patient is
in bad condition, the proposed system wil notify through web portal
access to determine what really happened to the patient. The mobile app
will notify to the user for a recommendation on what to do if their blood
pressure is increased. Also it will track the patient through global

positioning system (GPS) in web to know where the patient's location.

INTRODUCTION

4.1 Rationale of the Study

In our fast-paced world, managing our personal and professional lives
can be really hectic (DeGreeff et al., 2010). If we don’t have our own personal
made of transportation, life becomes more hectic (Ellaway et al., 2002).
Driving a car is important for people in general because it provides status and
opportunity for personal control and autonomy, since it provides the only
opportunity for travelling long distances due to lack of public transport (Beirao
et al.,2007). However, despite of the increasing need for vehicles, vehicular
accidents recorded have also been increasing (Hevelkeet al.,2015).. Every
day, hundreds of road traffic accidents occur (Siddique al.,2015).And the
leading cause of vehicular accidents is drunk-driving (Dills al.,2010). Because
of this, vehicular sensors and devices detect the driver's alcohol intoxication

have been continuously manufactured and installed. (Hannon, al., 2014).

Better solutions must be made to help lessen the growing numbers of
recorded deaths and injuries caused by drunk-driving. The existing
procedures that law enforcers are using are still ineffective up to this
day(Emerson et al. 1980). Public agencies, law enforcers, and vehicle
manufacturers need to work together and understand the importance of
optimizing vehicular sensors (Rowlinso et al., 2004). The strategic action to
improve vehicular sensors in the purpose of saving more lives cause by

drunk-driving should not be taken for granted (Hannon, al, 2014).
Each year, there are approximately 1.24 million deaths due to road traffic
crashes — a global problem that the World Health Organization (WHO) says is
both predictable and preventable. The Philippines is also seeing worrying
figures, with the data from the Philippine Statistic Authority (PSA) showing
that the number of deaths due to road crashes has been increasing since

2006. (Bachani, 2017)

Alcohol is the leading risk factor for the road trauma globally and locally,
and leading the cause of death and disability. Based on data gathered by
local agencies, there was an alcohol-impaired traffic fatality every 48 minutes
in 2017 worldwide. These crashes involve at least one driver or motorcycle
operator with blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 grams per decilitre or above,
the legal definition of impaired driving. About 10, 500 people a year lost their

lives in alcohol-impaired crashes between 2008 and 2017. (Peden, 2017)

At present, the situation is still worsening. The accounted deaths and
injuries caused by drunk-driving have gradually increased every year since
then. And despite the overwhelming evidence and efforts of the strict
enforcement and implementations of drunk-driving policies to lead to a drastic
reduction in alcohol-related road incidents, many countries, including the
Philippines, still lack sufficient resources to facilitate the design and of

appropriate drunk-driving interventions. (Gururaj, 2017)

It is for this reason why, the proponents saw an opportunity to provide a
Solution in improving the present condition by creating a prototype called
“Optimized Drunk-Driving Detection with Vehicular Motion Control

Mechanism’, that will lessen the alarming increase of not only accidents
caused by drunk-driving, but also the inconvenience drunk-driving accidents

cause in the community. (Norton, 2018)

"Butuan City Boarding House Locator System
","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The proposed Butuan City Boarding House Locator was designed and
developed according to the information the proponents have gathered. The
researchers gathered all the requirements and information in order to develop

the proposed system.

The Butuan City Boarding House Locator consists of 3 different web
portals the search portal, owner portal and admin portal, The search portal
allows the search user to search for a boarding house according to the search
user conditions. The owner portal allows all registered boarding house owner
in the system to update his/her boarding house availability and vacancy. If the
vacant number reaches 0 the system automatically update the availability to
full and if the vacancy number is equal to 1 or more not exceeding the total
number of boarders the system will automatically update the availability to
available. The admin portal allows the admin to register boarding house
owner and their boarding house to the system. The admin will give accounts
to the registered owner so they can use the system in updating their boarding

house information.

1.1. Introduction
A boarding house is a house with multiple vacant rooms (frequently a
family home) in which lodgers rent one or more rooms for one or more nights,
and sometimes for extended periods of weeks, months, and years. The
common parts of the house are maintained, and some services, such as
laundry and cleaning, may be supplied. They normally provide “room and
board"" that is, at least some meals as well as accommodation. A ""lodging
house,"" also known in the United States as a “rooming house,"" may or may
not offer meals. Lodgers legally only obtain a license to use their rooms, and
not exclusive possession, so the landlord retains the right of access.
According to the data that we have gathered in the City Hall of Butuan city,
there are 195 registered boarding houses in the city. There are also 25

registered apartments and 5 registered bachelors pad. The rest are registered

real state buildings and house for rent.

There are some studies about boarding house locator or locator
system. The Boarding house locator and monitoring system is a system that
monitors the students and locate boarding houses. It is a system that uses
spiral model as its development model (Reynold G. Bustillo and Benedicto G.
Batistis, 2016). The ATM locator system is a system that can locate ATM

machine from the users current location with the use of Global Positioning
System (GPS). The system is a web-based system that can be access using
iOS mobile phones (Lim Yen Yeng, 2012). The Location Based ATM locator
system (LBALS). The system also can locate ATM machines. It is developed
to aid people searching for ATM’s in case of emergency situations and helps
tourists or new comers who are not familiar with the place. The system uses
OpenStreetMap. OpenStreetMap is a growing open source digital map where
ATM booths are map (Rajib Chandra Das, Parijat Prashun Purohit, Tauhidul

Alam, Mahfuzu Chowdhury, 2014).

People who travel away from their homes for study or work are usually
the main occupants of a boarding house. In searching for a boarding house,
people travel from one place to another asking people for the location and the
pricing of each apartment, bachelors pads, and boarding houses. Some
boarding houses, apartments, and bachelor’s pad are located near flood
prone areas. Some has no fire exits and fire extinguishers, and no Wifi

"TRAFFIC CONGESTION DETECTION WITH ALTERNATIVE PATH
RECOMMENDATION
","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Traffic Congestion Detection with Alternative Path Recommendation is
designed mainly to aid the private drivers in avoiding traffic with the use of its features

in providing real time traffic status and altemative path.

Through study, the researchers determined a number of existing applications
that have the same features and are already used by private drivers. Therefore,
researchers used the traditional transport and vehicular systems that used a V2V
communication, in which data are reliant to the users. Thus, the researchers provided
a feature that is not available to any existing application such as using a CCTV to
provide a real time traffic status and an alternative path. With these features, the
researchers believed that it could really be a good help to private drivers in order to

easily check the traffic status of a specific road, avoid traffic, and shift to routes with

less traffic congestion.

To end, the researchers therefore concluded that the Traffic Congestion
Detection with Alternative Path Recommendation was able to achieve the objectives

and it can be used for future application purposes.
Scanned with CamScanner
","1.1 Introduction

Nowadays, application is used to provide access for road status. The
increase of transportation in society causes many problems. Such annual
economic loss caused by traffic congestion. Cities showed a large increase in
road traffic which leads to deterioration in Capacity and disorganized traffic

system.

In Metro Manila the heavy traffic is due to many factors such as the over
population of residents, congestion of private vehicles, inefficient services of rail
transportation, and the ineffective traffic control management in the country’s
capital region (Rig Man, 2015). Traffic congestion in Butuan City is now apparent
due to the rapid increase of growth rate, that as of 2007 the number of
population is 298,378 while in 2015 was only 337,063 people. (census.gov.ph,
2016). A total of 81,901 licensed private cars, excluding the pending plastic
license plate from August 2015 to January 2017, the inadequacy of transit
options is the obstacle that causes blockage and merger. Double parking, road

works, and narrow roads also caused traffic in Butuan City.

A real time monitoring of traffic information is obtainable with the help of
CCTV camera. A simple image processing on the frames to estimate traffic

density based on analysis of traffic images from live traffic feed that can identify
traffic status. The researchers used a customized Haar Classifier in OpenCV to

detect and count the number of cars recognize by the CCTV.

Thus, identifying traffic status is relevant for the development of Traffic
Congestion Detection with Alternative Path Recommendation (TCD-APR). An
application designed to detect the real-time state of traffic congestion that
allows user to search desired destination and to provide an alternative path.
The advance GPS can mitigate this by finding less congested routes. Hence,

the study aims to lessen the traffic congestion, and provide alternative path to

improve the economic development in Butuan City.

1.2 Project Context

According to Rosen, people are facing traffic problems every day.
Unfortunately, the causes are the following: (1) narrow roads (2) drivers
disrespecting traffic rules especially the loading and unloading of passengers
(3) parallel parking space (4) not following urban standard planning in terms of
road. 15 meters away from the center lane (yellow lines) is for parking space
and the additional 15 meters is a distance standard in constructing a building .
(Rossen A., 2013)

The extent effect of heavy traffic congestion can cause drivers’

frustration particularly the slower speed and the increase of vehicle queuing.

Thus, difficulties in knowing real-time traffic status arise. Private drivers tend to
look for altemative ways to get away traffic jam. Drivers who are unfamiliar with

the place will ask for alternative path to avoid traffic.

Currently, transport and vehicular systems rely on the given data from
vehicle users (V2V communication); and using electronic sensors embedded in
the road system to find out if the congestion of traffic really exists in a particular

road. It is not efficient, reliable and effective to meet the users’ needs.

The researchers implemented an image processing on the frames using
OpenCV to provide flexible and reliable vehicle counting method. Which
provides more accurate information to help the users in searching for alternate

roads and to easily look for the traffic status anywhere, everywhere because of

its dependability.

"DETERMINING POTENTIAL INVESTMENT AREAS OF
SURIGAO DEL NORTE
","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The province of Surigao del Norte is rich in natural resources where many
investors are interested in investing when it comes to the leading industries of
Fishery, Agriculture, Mining, and Eco-Tourism. Surigao del Norte is part of
CARAGA that envisions to be the FAME center of the country for the year 2030.
In contribution to the goal of the said region, the researchers come up with the
idea of creating an application that will help potential investors who wants to put
up a business in Surigao del Norte. With the application providing areas and

particular investments on the products of the area.

The proponents adapt the concept of Geographic Information System and
the idea of Decision Support System that will help the investor to expedite
decision making process by providing visual representation of the map of Surigao
del Norte using Open Street Map as the base map of the system. Together with
the map are the data relevant to Surigao del Norte like population density, hazard

susceptibility of a particular area, road maps, facilities, and networks.

During the testing, the proponents conducted a research using the System
Usability Scale Test that will help to evaluate the efficacy of the system. As a

result, the average percentage is 78.63. According to the score measurements
and industry standards, the system is good and doing okay but could use

improvements.

Introduction

1.1 Project Context

In today’s highly competitive and globalized economy, decision-makers
face tough challenges in managing investments in a sustainable and profitable
manner. One of the problems of investors is having costly mistakes upon
investing. Currently, investors still manually gather relevant data to guide them in
determining key investment areas pertaining to Fishery, Agriculture, Mining and
Eco-tourism (FAME) in the province of Surigao del Norte.

Investors often personally go to different agencies or government offices
in order for them to gather data, which will take a long period of time before
concluding which investment area to choose. Potential investors may utilize the
power of internet to conduct further research, but the disadvantage is that there
is no specific website to visit that generates the necessary data for their
evaluation and therefore, information gathered are unreliable for decision-
making.

Surigao del Norte is located in the Northeastern part of Mindanao between
125°15' to 126° 15' east longitude and 9° 18' to 10° 30' north latitude. It is
bounded on the North and East by the Pacific Ocean, on the South by the

Provinces of Agusan del Norte and Surigao del Sur and on the West by the
Surigao Strait. It belongs to the new region, the CARAGA Region, which is

composed of five (5) provinces and six (6) cities.

The CARAGA'’s long-term development goal is to become the FAME
center of the country by the year 2030, by developing the region’s abundant
resources in fishery, agriculture, forestry, mining, and eco-tourism as growth
drivers of the region’s economy. (Revised Caraga RDP, 2013-2016)

The proposed system, Determining Potential Investment Areas for
Surigao del Norte (DPIA-SDN), is useful in providing visualization and spatial
analysis by using Geographic Information System (GIS) that has been long
used for data analysis, various researches and studies in areas such as land
use planning, environmental planning, and disaster management planning.
The recent innovations in GIS technology are becoming influential in leading
the market toward development of nationwide computerized open access.
This GIS technology together with Data Driven type of Decision Support
System will help serious prospective investors to determine which potential
areas to invest such as fishery, agriculture, mining, and eco-tourism.

Data Driven type of Decision Support System are form of support
system that focuses on the provision of internal data to aid decision making.
Most often this will come in the form of a data warehouse where the data will
be processed. A data-driven DSS helps to transform large data sets into
meaningful, easy to read business information.(FOIS, 2006) The best
example of a Data Driven DSS is the Geographical Information System which

can be used to visually represent geographically dependent data using maps.
(Dimitris Liparas, Nov 14, 2076) By presenting relevant information in maps

and satellite imagery, through access to a web browser, investors can perform
researches concerning

the categories of FAME. A rapidly accessed geographic data that can allow
smarter and more efficient decision-making to the investors and help them

avoid spending larger amount of cost on manual and physical research.

"REAL ESTATE REGISTRATION SYSTEM WITH GEOGRAPHIC
INFORMATION SYSTEM (GIS)
","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Real estate registration systems are systems or software that keep track of
real properties available for sale. Using these systems, one can view information on
real estate properties without the need to visit the actual sites. It also provides
system administrators means to keep records of the transactions involved in the sale

of real properties.

GIS is a computer system for storing, displaying, checking related data about
the position on earth surface. GIS can show data in one map to help people analyze
and compare and differentiate the relationship of things in the earth’s terrain. It also
includes locations such as farms, housing and other relevant establishments.

The Real Estate Registration System with GIS will provide potential buyers a
means to search desired locations at a glance. This is made possible by utilizing
accurate GlS-based maps and up-to-date data from the local Land Registration
Authority. It also lifts the burden from the land sellers in advertising their properties
and alleviates the hassle in real estate sales processing. With the help of the GIS-
based property finder, viewers can use smartphones or tablets with browsers to

easily access the site. The system also track the available property for sale and it

can locate exact location of the property instead of visiting personally.

The Real Estate Registration System with GIS will help to locate the exact
location of property particularly in Butuan City. The system is the response to the
problem faced in some real estate management companies without Geographic

Introduction

1.1 Project Context

Real Estate Registration System are systems that keep track of
properties that are available for sale. Using these systems, the information the
property can be viewed online without the need to visit the actual site. It also
provides a system administrator to keep records of the transactions involved
in selling the property.

Real Estate is the way of buying and selling valuable properties like
house and lots. It involves: identifying clients, conducting research to identify

real estate needs, arranging meetings with prospective clients, providing
analytical support for cash flow and other financial analyses as well as
gathering market data. Letters of intent proposing business terms to
prospecting clients help build strong client relationships by delivering best,
high class, quality service which includes providing relevant information to
clients on timely basis. Planning and communicating become easier now with
the use of technology. Geographic Information System (GIS) is one of the
innovations making it easy to locate a particular site in Google Map or any

properties related to the position on earth’s surface.
Geographic information system (GIS) is a computer system for storing,
checking and displaying data about specific position or location on the earth’s
surface. GIS can show data in one map to help people analyze, compare and
differentiate the relationship of things in the earth’s terrain. It also includes
locations such as farms, housing and other relevant establishments. Much
different information may be compared and contrasted using GIS. For

example, a GlS-generated map could include sites that produce high market
value of properties. Earlier technologies only rely on Google Map to locate a
certain property on the earth’s surface. This poses a problem especially when
uploading and capturing data on one map. Existing real estate registration
systems without GIS still have some flaws. Some of these systems provide
locations using Google maps, as can be seen at www.propertyfinderph.com.
Though these provide the location of the properties, they cannot provide the
exact coordinates and measurements of the properties. Other systems, like
www.property24.com.ph only provide Google Maps. These maps do not even
provide markers to pinpoint the exact location of the real property. They do
not utilize GIS to present the exact location of a particular area. The existing
real estate registration systems still utilize the traditional search bar.
Searching for properties involves typing on a search bar. With the use of the
traditional search bar, results are displayed as images that fits as to what is
being searched. For Real Estate buyers, searching for the availability of
properties in certain areas is difficult. It is also virtually impossible to subdivide
land having exact measurements without visiting it physically.
These problems are addressed in the proposed Real Estate

Registration System. Using the data gathered from the local City Assessor's
Office, the area of the involved properties can be plotted on the map,

pinpointing its exact location. Using this method, the exact shape and

measurements of an identified property can be visualized by just looking at a
map. The proposed system will also feature a map-based search where
viewers can browse and filter the properties displayed on the map. By utilizing
the data obtained from local government agencies and GIS software, the
system will be able to provide suggestions on how to subdivide real properties

in cases where the property for sale is only a part of a much bigger property

or land.

4.1 Introduction

The food shop is a place where people pay to sit and eat meals

that are served on the premises. Butuan City is one of the places that

sells delicious seafood, it is also where families indulge their time in
enjoyment. Furthermore Butuan City has many natural attractions like
Agusan River and Mt. Mayapay. There are also man made attractions
like: Ramon Magsaysay bridge, Balangay Boats, Balangay Shrine
Museum, National Museum(Butuan City Branch), Guingona Park, Delta
Discovery Park and Bood Promontory Eco Park. Nowadays, there are
easy way to locate food shops by using an Android phone. Mapping
can locate and calculate distance which is useful for locating premises
and allow users to explore with a map, identify locations with custom
markers, augment the map data with image overlays, embed one ore
more maps as fragments and much more. Thus, the Information
Technology community has the idea to develop projects by using

mapping to locate certain premises such as a food shop.

Food is essential for Sustaining human life, providing the
nutrients and calories that deliver the energy necessary for people to

gO about their day to day activities(J. D’Acosta, 2015). Mobile
applications can be one of the best ways to keep consumers engaged

with a brand as they are on the move. With the increase in demand for
smartphones and efficiency of wireless networks, the demand for
mobile applications has increased incredibly (S.R. Parne, 2013). A
person needs a path finder application or the smart mobile applications

so that easy to track the location of the hotel and checkout the status

(A. Diwan et al., 2016).

Finding food shops like fast foods, restaurants, bakeries and
other food shops can be hard especially for tourists that aren't even
familiar with the place. Travelers have to ask the local people for the
food shop which they want to go to and where to find it. They also want
to ask for other information like what food do they serve, and where is
the nearest food shop. This can be very problematic and frustrating
since they would get lost and waste time just trying to find the food

shop that they want.

The proponents then thought of developing an Android
application called “Food Shop Locator in Butuan City using mapping”
that will enable users to locate food shops using MapBox in Android
devices. The Android application should be able to search and locate

the nearest food shop and calculate the distance between the user and
the food shops with indications of how near or far the food shop is. The
user can also search by how much budget they have and specify food

categories, like for example seafood, barbecue and desserts to filter

out to where and what food shop they want to go.

1.1 Project Context

There are times that assistance or help from others; will be needed,
especially with regards to technical difficulties. The person that might provide
such assistance can be a member of the family, a best friend, a colleague, or
even a stranger. Our preference of whom to ask and whom to provide
services depends on various things which ranges from familiarity, expertise,
locations, and etc. The idea of providing services to such people who are in
need is the premise where the study lies upon.

There are various avenues in the context of service provision. The trend
now is maximizing the information technology platform that covers the
utilization of software services such as web and mobile applications. With this
in mind, the proponents came up with a mobile application idea that can assist
people with their demands about the services in the context of technical
expertise that ranges from electronic services, health and pampering services,
tutorials and etc, Through this application anyone can be provided with the
right information on the availability of needed service as well as the people

that can provide it, Other information can also be viewed which are relevant to
the services the provider can offer that includes academic accomplishments,

skill-set information and service rates.

The consideration as to what services will be available and included in
the application must be identified. A way for this to be done is to somehow
generate a rank of the most requested services by the people which will be
done through surveys. Access to these services is something that should be
carefully examined to. The mode by which services will be requested and
provided will be reflected on the system design. The profile of the service
provider must also be comprehensive in nature. Through this, the customer
will be provided with relevant information about the service provider.

Aside from the point by which the concept was materialized, conceptual
information that will be identified and utilized, technical knowledge on
application development is also required for this project. It is expected that the
proponents will utilized theories and concepts of CSS, HTML, PHP, internet,
Google Map, computer programming, and various software and hardware

ABSTRACT

Tracer study is an approach which is globally used in most organization
especially in the educational institutions to track and to keep a record of
students once graduated from the institution’ This Study aims to develop a
Decision Support System (DSS) tool that will analyze the systematic tracing of
graduates and make decisions based on the outcome of the forecast. Decision
Support System (DSS) is an information system that supports business or
organizational decision-making activities. This serves the management,
operations and planning levels of an organization and help people make
decisions about problems that may be rapidly changing and not easily specified
in advance. The proponents used Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average
(ARIMA) a time-series analysis model to forecast the future number of
graduates in the upcoming year as well as the graduate’s productivity and
competitiveness, also the number of employed and unemployed graduates. To
improve decision making and analyzing of data; to generate statistical results a
decision support system tool must be develop. The proponents conducted a
Survey to test the developed system’s efficiency to the graduates as the
respondents and was acceptable based on the obtained 3.95 mean average.
With that, the proponents developed a decision support system that would give

INTRODUCTION

A study of (Gonzales, 2017) states that tracer studies have been used
as an evaluating tool for the transition of the students from their education to
their profession. It aims to track the professional development of graduates with
regards to the relevance of their skills and training acquired from the university.
According to Prof. Adelaida C. Gines, PhD. in the Philippines, the Commission
on Higher Education requires all Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to conduct
a tracer study and is equally reflected as one of the required documents by any
higher education accrediting body such as the Philippine Association of

Colleges and Universities Commission on Accreditation (PACUCOA) for

private schools. Forecasting is a common Statistical task in business, where
it helps to inform decisions about the Scheduling of Production, transportation
and personnel, and provides a guide to long-term Strategic planning.
(Hyndman and Athanasopoulos, 2018).

A study of Dato’ Seri Mohamed Khaled bin Nordin and Menteri
Pengajian Tinggi cited that Graduate Tracer Study has proven to be an
effective method in getting accurate and quick inputs for ensuring the human

Capital produced by higher education institutions are at all times relevant and

be able to meet the ever-changing demand of job market. The Association of

African Universities or AAU, and Boaduo, Mensah and Babitseng, explain
that tracer studies enable the contextualization of graduates of a university
through a system that is dynamic and reliable to determine their life path or
movement. It also enables the evaluation of the results of the education and
training provided by an institution and examines and evaluates the current

and future career and employment opportunities or prospects of graduates.
In today’s era, most of the universities and colleges are using the
Graduate tracer system to trace the graduates on how much they have
improved after graduated and which field of work they are in. However,
graduate tracer alone cannot give an accurate result if the certain institution is
doing well in implementing their academic programs. Thus, through Time-
Series Analysis method, it can be used to understand past data as well as to
predict the future. Furthermore, Decision Support System (DSS) can provide a
decision with effective mechanisms to better understand the decision problem
and the implications of their decision behaviors of the organization by allowing
them to interactively exchange information between the system and
themselves. Moreover, the institution can easily grasp result on the academic
Status of the graduating student on what field of expertise they are going to take

and on what improvements might the institution would do.

Thus, the proponents came up with the idea of developing ACLC
Graduate Tracer and Forecasting using Time-Series Analysis to forecast the
graduates’ productivity on the field they choose. Also, to graphically generate
results on the statistics of how many graduates are employed and unemployed.
To measure if the graduates are productive and globally competitive, and to
forecast the number of future graduates, the proponents used AutoRegressive
Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). ARIMA model’s goal is to predict future
moves by examining the differences between values in the series instead of
through actual values. Consequently, ACLC Graduate Tracer and Forecasting
using Time-Series Analysis is a Decision Support System tool that can predict

trends and future values. Further, it can generate graphical results and report

that can help the institution for future decision making.
4.2 Project Context
In an institution, a graduate tracer is an important tool to evaluate the

graduates as they employ themselves into work. Also, it helps the institution to
assess if the curricular programs are implemented efficiently. ACLC College of
Butuan has been tracing their graduate students on what endeavours they are
taking; however, the institution is still using the manual process of recording the
graduates’ employment information. This traditional way of storing data can be
a problem since the tendency of misplacing it is at risks. Moreover, the
institution is having a hard time identifying how many graduates are productive
and globally competitive.

The ACLC Graduate Tracer and Forecasting using Time-Series Analysis
was developed to easily evaluate the graduates and generate a result that helps
the school decide on how to counter the sighted outcome. Also, to eradicate
the manual method of tracing the graduates in a more established way of
searching, adding and updating the information. However, to develop this
project the proponents need to meet the required tools such as Python
Programming Language, Flask Micro Web Framework, XAMMP, MYSQL, Web
Browser, Sublime, AJAX, Command Prompt, and a Computer or Laptop.

The proponents were using Python Programming Language to set
instructions with Flask Micro Web Framework and to code the system using
Sublime that runs through the Command Prompt. To work on the project, the
proponents needed a Computer or a Laptop. A Web Browser to view the output
of the codes and to see the adjustments to be made. For the back-end of the

Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as a method in making the application was
very useful and helpful in identifying errors during the development. The
following technologies like Android Studio and ARCGIS are used in making
the application. The proponents conducted a Survey for the application quality
of the system to places that has a high risk of imminent threat like flood prone
area and was highly acceptable based on the total mean obtained of 4.70.
The application was indeed useful to the residents of Butuan City who live in
the flood prone area because it helps them find the nearest evacuation center
base on user's current location before the situation get worst. This eliminates
the manual way of telling the people in Butuan City to evacuate on that certain
School or covered court by barangay officer going to their houses. It was
relevant and important as per needs for safety and welfare of the community.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Introduction

Butuan City is located at the northeastern part of the Agusan

Valley, Mindanao, sprawling across the Agusan River. It is bounded to the north,
west and south by Agusan del Norte to the east by Agusan Del Sur and to the
northwest by Butuan Bay. The fact that the city is a plain low-lying area adjacent
to a river and a lake makes the place vulnerable to floods anytime the water level
rises. AS most people are well aware, floods have large consequences for
communities and individuals including death, damage to property, loss of
livestock, and deterioration of health conditions owing to waterborne disease.
Flood is the most common calamity to strike Butuan City and it still occurs to the

present time, affecting many Butuanons.

According to Rey Francis B. Lincuna one of the Barangay Kagawad in
San Ignacio that numbers of individuals are not familiar with the safety guidelines
and the basic survival skills. During calamity, the most essential aspect of
surviving is to know the location of the large facility near you. Some
inexperienced individuals tend to neglect their responsibility towards keeping
each other safe, they are not aware of the basic protection rules. As a result, they
often think that their house is the safest place when in fact there are facilities that

accommodate people in transition during emergencies.

According to City Disaster Risk Reduction Management Office (CDRRMO)

Officials, the common evacuation center in Butuan City is their school or covered
court. The people who are house fire victim and people who experience floods in

their places or any kinds of calamity would be evacuated to their nearest
evacuation center in their barangay.

Evacuation Center Locator using Geographical Information System
(ECLGIS), is all about locating the nearest evacuation center base on user's
current location in Butuan City. The user should open the global positioning
system (GPS), on their smartphones and after that it would automatically
determine where they are. It would also give all nearest evacuation center based
on user current location. And the application would also identify if the evacuation
center nearest to the user is either school or covered court. So that user can
choose alternative places to go if an emergency occurs. For this reason, the
proponents come up with an idea on developing an android application that

would help the citizens of Butuan city on locating all nearest evacuation center

based on user current location.
1.2 Project Context

According to City Disaster Risk Reduction Management Office
(CDRRMO), Evacuation center is the immediate egress or escape of people
away from an area that has a high risk of imminent threat that could lead to a
Catastrophe. Nowadays, we encounter various calamities such as typhoons and
earthquakes from time to time. Therefore, Evacuation Center Locator Using
Geographical Information System (ECLGIS) is developed to lead them to the

most efficient place to go if an emergency occurs. The people in Butuan City
must know where to stay and where to go in case in of natural calamity and
disaster to avoid any kinds of accident.

In this manner, the proponents therefore proposed the Evacuation Center
Locator using Geographical Information System (ECLGIS). This android
application is only to find the nearest evacuation center based on user current
location, For example, you live in flood prone area and a sudden strong rain
came that would cause an overflowing river. You can just use this application and
the application would locate all nearest evacuation center based on Users

current Location and this android application has a feature that would give a

route from your own location to your chosen evacuation center.

"“GREENBOT”
AN AUTOMATED INDOOR GREENHOUSE FOR MICROGREEN PLANTS
USING RASPBERRY PI
","ili
ABSTRACT

GreenBot is an automated indoor greenhouse management system for
microgreen plants that allows the user to manage, monitor and be notified of its
growth and status from planting until harvesting. The purpose of this research
is to develop an accurate, portable but automated indoor greenhouse for
microgreen plants using cheaper materials in order to help the user manage
their microgreens even if they are not around or without direct user intervention.
The programing languages used for GreenBot are Python for server-side
processes and for modules in controlling hardware, JavaScript for user
interface functionalities, HTML and CSS for user-interface design. GreenBot
uses Twillio SMS platform for sending SMS notification. The system uses
pythonanywhere.com for the webhosting of systems online interface. The
Hardware modules used by the system are DHT11 sensor module which is
used for taking the temperature and humidity, Soil moisture sensor and analog
to digital module which is used for measuring water level and soil moisture level,
LED lights for lighting. Brushless DC exhaust fan for ventilation, camera for
taking up pictures, water pump for watering plants and Raspberry Pi which is
the main component of the system that contains the system files, scripts and
assets used by GreenBot. The materials and interface used by the system
helps the user to grown their microgreen plant even if they’re not around
because of the automation of lighting, ventilation and watering of the plants.
The user also stays on track by SMS notification sent by the GreenBot about
the status of the machine like temperature, humidity and the water container
level. User can also see their plants remotely by visiting the systems online
Page and by clicking take picture button to see the plants. Greenbot is really
helpful especially for people who are home growing microgreens themselves
that doesn’t always have the time to manage it whether it’s for personal
consumption or for business purposes.

Introduction

Microgreens, according to Warner (2012), as their name implies,
are small greens that are often no more than 2 inches tall. Beyond
looking great on a salad, Sandwiches, or as garnish, microgreens also
offer a unique assortment of flavors, nutritional and medicinal benefits.
Researcher Qin Wang (2012) says that, the microgreens were 4 to 40
fold more concentrated with nutrients than their mature counterparts. For
example, red cabbage microgreens had 40 times more vitamin E and six
times more vitamin C than mature red cabbage. Cilantro microgreens
had three times more beta-carotene than mature cilantro. Microgreens
can be grown inside a greenhouse where climate and other factors that
help grow this kind of plant can be regulated or can be home grown as
they are capable of living with a little amount of sunlight and a little

amount of water.

There are factors to be considered in planting and growing
Microgreens. Soil moisture can affect the growth of microgreens as well
as sunlight, air and proper ventilation. People cannot take care of them
all the time. So, in this paper, we present a critical discussion of the
research on taking care of Microgreens. There has been a range of
insightful contributions to the scientific literature both in terms of
theoretical issues and practical aspects. The main aim of this research

is to highlight the new trends and key research achievements that can
help planting this Microgreens with the aid of technological
advancements and innovations. But using this can be costly, bulky and

hard operate.

Due to these reasons and with the help of today’s technology, the
proponents came up with the idea to make an automated small version
of a Greenhouse which can regulate climate based on the plant's climate
specifications. It will also help plant and manage microgreens and its
needs (water, sunlight, ventilation) with or without the user’s intervention
using only the cheapest materials that utilizes operations similar to the
expensive ones (which can also operate without user’s intervention) to
help address these problems and provide solutions that will enhance the

cultivation of microgreens.

"KEY DISPENSER WITH FACE RECOGNITION USING RASPBERRY PI
","vil
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Aimed to develop a key dispenser with face recognition using Raspberry
pi. It employed developmental research method. There were thirty (30)
respondents utilized to evaluate the developed system. The respondents were
given questionnaire to provide information intended for evaluating the
developed system. The questionnaire was patterned after the international
Standard organization (ISO) 1926-1 software quality standard the mean was
used for computation in determining the system’s functionality, reliability,
accuracy, and security. The developed system provides a modernized and
efficient system for distributing keys. It was developed using iterative waterfall
development model techniques that employed top-down approach as a
Strategic method to the system development. The following were performed,
namely: data gathering procedures, requirement analysis, designing, coding,
testing and evaluation, and implementation. The system was found highly
functional, reliable, highly accurate, and highly secure with the total mean
obtained 4.21, 4.12,4.24, 4.39 respectively. The software quality of the system
developed a Key Dispenser with Face Recognition using Raspberry pi was
highly acceptable to the users based on the total mean obtained of 4.24. The
positive outcome recommendation for deployment of the developed system.

","1.1 Introduction

Currently, the world depends on technology and everyone from
young to old seems to be deeply involved. Technology has become
one of the most important elements in today’s societies and its role in
our lives keeps getting complex. According to N. Anusha, A. D. Sai and
B. Srikar (2017) Facial recognition is commonly used nowadays for
security purposes and also a very accurate way of verifying a user
when logging in. Raspberry pi 3 is a small complete computer that has
a microprocessor and other features required of a functional computer
such as keyboard, mouse, camera, and memory. A key dispenser is a
system that contains a key and distributes it in a well-organized way for
the employees. The proponents will develop a system that will
implement the aspects of raspberry pi, face recognition, and key
dispenser that will serve the company as well as the employees and
staffs.

According to Renée Lynn Midrack (February 24, 2018) Facial
recognition technology is considered part of biometrics, the
measurement of biological data by devices orsoftware, similar
to fingerprint scanning and eye/iris scanning systems. Computers use
facial recognition software to identify or verify a person by mapping
facial features, characteristics, and dimensions and comparing that

information with immense databases of faces. According to (/. Gupta,
V. Patil C. Kadam and S. Dumbre, ""Face detection and
recognition using Raspberry Pi,"" 2016 IEEE International WIE

Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (WIECON-ECE),
Pune, 2016, pp. 83-86)

Face recognition has become one of the most important user
identification methods. According to Robert G. Spignesi Jr. Mark
Longley (2016) A system for dispensing a plurality of customized doses
of pharmaceuticals includes: a housing; a customized packaging
station configured to selectively package individual doses of medication
into customized packaging, and a controller connected to the customer

interaction station and the customized packaging station.

Companies today are still using manual process of distributing
keys for their rooms. What modern companies need nowadays is a
systematic way for this process. The old manual process will take time,
hassle and will delay the employee if the key is still in use and could
not identify who is using the key. Companies are still using a cabinet
where all the keys are placed, which may allow anyone to just get a
key easily even if it is not an authorized person. There are complains
that the keys are not placed and organized properly when returned to
the key holder. The person in-charge could not identify and could not
identify the last employee who used a key and will be a problem if it is

misplaced.

"Butuan City Boarding House Locator System
","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The proposed Butuan City Boarding House Locator was designed and
developed according to the information the proponents have gathered. The
researchers gathered all the requirements and information in order to develop

the proposed system.

The Butuan City Boarding House Locator consists of 3 different web
portals the search portal, owner portal and admin portal. The search portal
allows the search user to search for a boarding house according to the search
user conditions. The owner portal allows all registered boarding house owner
in the system to update his/her boarding house availability and vacancy. If the
vacant number reaches 0 the system automatically update the availability to
full and if the vacancy number is equal to 1 or more not exceeding the total
number of boarders the system will automatically update the availability to
available. The admin portal allows the admin to register boarding house
owner and their boarding house to the system. The admin will give accounts
to the registered owner so they can use the system in updating their boarding

house information.
","4.1. Introduction

A boarding house is a house with multiple vacant rooms (frequently a
family home) in which lodgers rent one or more rooms for one or more nights,
and sometimes for extended periods of weeks, months, and years. The
common parts of the house are maintained, and some services, such as
laundry and cleaning, may be supplied. They normally provide “room and
board” that is, at least some meals as well as accommodation. A “lodging
house,” also known in the United States as a ""rooming house,"" may or may
not offer meals. Lodgers legally only obtain a license to use their rooms, and
not exclusive possession, so the landlord retains the right of access.
According to the data that we have gathered in the City Hall of Butuan city,
there are 195 registered boarding houses in the city. There are also 25
registered apartments and 5 registered bachelors pad. The rest are registered

real state buildings and house for rent.

There are some studies about boarding house locator or locator
system. The Boarding house locator and monitoring system is a system that
monitors the students and locate boarding houses. It is a system that uses
spiral model as its development model (Reynold G. Bustillo and Benedicto G.
Batistis, 2016). The ATM locator system is a system that can locate ATM

Machine from the user's current location with the use of Global Positioning
System (GPS). The system is a web-based system that can be access using
iOS mobile phones (Lim Yen Yeng, 2012). The Location Based ATM locator
system (LBALS). The system also can locate ATM machines. It is developed
to aid people searching for ATM's in case of emergency situations and helps
tourists or new comers who are not familiar with the place. The system uses
OpenStreetMap. OpenStreetMap is a growing open source digital map where
ATM booths are map (Rajib Chandra Das, Parijat Prashun Purohit, Tauhidul

Alam, Mahfuzu Chowdhury, 2014).

People who travel away from their homes for study or work are usually
the main occupants of a boarding house. In searching for a boarding house,
people travel from one place to another asking people for the location and the
pricing of each apartment, bachelor’s pads, and boarding houses. Some
boarding houses, apartments, and bachelor’s pad are located near flood

prone areas. Some has no fire exits and fire extinguishers, and no Wifi

accessibility and far away from the city.
The proponents develop the “Boarding House Locator System”. The
system can provide an advance way of searching and locating Boarding
Houses, apartments, and Bachelor’s Pad. This will lessen the time consumed
in searching, also reduce the hassle of locating boarding houses. It can also
know if the location is near a flood prone area, have a fire exits and fire

extinguishers, have also a Wifi access and also safer to rent.

A system and appertaining methods are provided that make it possible
to order pizza and other products using an instant messaging or other signaling
mechanisms such as cellular phones and two-way pagers, using a tokenized
representation of the order elements (Kargman, 201 1). The system and method
provide for issuing an employee an identifier (Stoutenburg, 1999). Production
planning has among its objectives the determination of inventory levels. In this
Paper, we are primarily concerned with inventories that are involved in the
industrial production, namely inventories of raw materials, purchased and
manufactured parts, subassemblies, assemblies, and finished products (Hax,
1979). A computer system and method is used for processing bills for a vast
number of customers of a plurality of node systems within a larger system, with
each customer bill having a particular billing cycle, which comprises of a
memory for storing a plurality of customer bill records containing raw data to be
processed to generate a customer bill (Cohen, 2002). A portable electronic

device includes a queuing system (Lee, 2014).

Based on the study of Willam Doan (2003), a method and system for entering
an order into an onsite computer-based sales management system of a

restaurant.
A communication link is established between an offsite employee and an order-
placing talk box at the restaurant. The communication link is utilized for two-
way voice communication so that a food order can be taken from a customer
located at the restaurant by the offsite employee. A data communication link is
utilized by the offsite employee to enter the order into the onsite computer-
based sales management system which facilitates food preparation, fee
collection, and the recording of sales. Preferably, the offsite employee utilizes
a personal computer to accomplish the stated functions, the communication
links are provided via the Internet, and the customer is located within a vehicle

adjacent the restaurant when placing his/her order.

An objective of the present invention is to provide a method and system
for routing food orders over a computer network to enable customers to place
food orders such as pizza orders electronically, in a customer centric
environment that reflects their needs and preferences, and provides the
convenience they have come to expect from any shopping experience (Vitek,
2003). Another objective of the present invention is to provide a method and
system for routing food orders over a computer network wherein the invention
works with a point-of-sale systems such as new proposed point-of-sale systems
(NGSS) and legacy point-of-sale systems (NSC, Breakaway, other) and
wherein the experience of the consumer will be consistent no matter what

technology exists at a food store (Wagner, 2003).

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

ACLC E-Classroom Management System is designed as a useful tool
to help the ACLC of Butuan for their learning process. It provides some
features that will improve the interaction of instructors and students during or

after class hours.

The proponents are well aware that there plenty of existing systems
that have the same functions and features that are used by other schools. In
that case, the proponents provided a feature that is not available on other
existing systems and that is the data integration of Student Information
System (SIS) and Enrollment System of ACLC so that the system will
automatically generate all the data. With these feature, the proponents
believed that it would help the ACLC of Butuan to improve the deliberation of

each class because the system will immediately assign the class sectioning.

To this end, the proponents therefore concluded that, ACLC E-
classroom Management System was able to achieve all the objectives and it
can be used to help the ACLC of Butuan. Furthermore, the mean result of the

Survey conducted is 90.4 the system is considered as efficient.

","Classroom management refers to the wide variety of skills and
techniques that instructors use to keep students organized, orderly,
focused, attentive, on task, and academically productive during a class (S.
Abbott, et. al. 2014). Also, it is a method on how an instructor can manage
all the students during or after class hour and it’s the process of ensuring
that classroom lessons run smoothly despite of the disruptive deliberation

of learning.

Classroom management is crucial in classrooms because it supports
the proper execution of curriculum development, developing best
teaching practices, and putting them into action. Classroom
management can be explained as the actions and directions that
teachers use to create a successful learning environment; indeed,
having a positive impact on students achieving given learning
requirements and goals (Soheili, et. al. 2012). James Duderstadt (2000),
a former president of the University of Michigan, stated in his book, A
University for the 21st Century, that universities should: 1) move beyond
the roles of research, education and service and be a knowledge server
engaged in producing, conserving, distributing, and applying knowledge
to different contexts; 2) serve as learning communities for teachers,

learners, and graduates by preparing them to engage in life-long
learning; and 3) change organizations into learner-centered systems

wherein learners determine and control what, when, where, how, and

with whom to learn.

It is evident from the cited studies that the instructors and students can
only communicate during their class hours. The instructor can only give a
quiz or an exercise to the students only during class hours. Also, when the
instructor will give an assignment or activities to the students for the next
meeting there would be some possibilities of misunderstanding about the

instructions or directions for the given home work.

Methods for the solutions of the stated problem are to develop an e —
classroom management system that will help ACLC of Butuan to improve
the interaction between instructors and students to assist them in their
learning process. It is a huge contribution in the part of the instructors as
well as the students in the way of communicating through web for
educational purposes. In addition, the proponents get the information from
the Student Information System (SIS) and Enrollment System of AMA
Computer Learning Center though data integration. All the data generated

will automatically display on ACLC E-Classroom Management System.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The proponents come up with a mobile application idea that will assist people
on their demands on services in the context of technical expertise. The descriptive
method of research was used in this study. Surveys and interviews were conducted in
order to identify the common services needed by people, access of these services and
people who can provide the service. The project is basically a mobile application in
which a client can access and request for services to service provider. One of the
objectives of this study is to give suggestion of service provider with high credibility
to address the needs of the clients, and at the same time to locate service providers.
This will also give benefits to the service provider, because it will somehow
propagate the extent of its operation to a wider market. The proponents use a Global
Positioning System (GPS) and Google Map for tracking of both client and service
provider’s location within Butuan City. The proponents choose android O.S. in
developing the project for its numerous users and demand on the market. The
development of this project is patterned with the System Development Life Cycle
(SDLC) Agile Approach. The proponents used the agile as a guide to get their goals
and to have an effective and efficient system. Theories and concepts of CSS, HTML,
PHP, internet, Google Map, computer programming, and various software and

hardware platforms are deemed necessary for the making of the project.

such assistance can be a member of the family, a best friend, a colleague, or
even a Stranger. Our preference of whom to ask and whom to provide
services depends on various things which ranges from familiarity, expertise,
locations, and etc. The idea of providing services to such people who are in
need is the premise where the study lies upon.

There are various avenues in the context of service provision. The trend
now is maximizing the information technology platform that covers the
utilization of software services such as web and mobile applications. With this
in mind, the proponents came up with a mobile application idea that can assist
people with their demands about the services in the context of technical
expertise that ranges from electronic services, health and pampering services,
tutorials and etc. Through this application anyone can be provided with the
right information on the availability of needed service as well as the people

that can provide it. Other information can also be viewed which are relevant to
the services the provider can offer that includes academic accomplishments,

skill-set information and service rates.

The consideration as to what Services will be available and included in
the application must be identified. A way for this to be done is to somehow
generate a rank of the most requested services by the people which will be
done through surveys. Access to these services is something that should be
carefully examined to. The mode by which services will be requested and
provided will be reflected on the system design. The profile of the service
provider must also be comprehensive in nature. Through this, the customer
will be provided with relevant information about the service provider.

Aside from the point by which the concept was materialized, conceptual
information that will be identified and utilized, technical knowledge on
application development is also required for this project. It is expected that the
Proponents will utilized theories and concepts of CSS, HTML, PHP, internet,
Google Map, computer programming, and various software and hardware

platforms. All of these are deemed necessary for the making of the project.

","1.1 INTRODUCTION

According to Jennifer Rowley (2005), today’s computerized world,
administrative offices also tend to become paperless offices and with no more
‘piles of files’ scenario. This advancement aids the governing bodies in
disposal of the issues within a reasonable time frame with evasion of
Stationery use. File Tracking System is a step in the direction of realizing the
concept of paperless office. The solution is a simulation of physical files into
the electronic form. This enables fast retrieval and makes file movement & file

tracking painless. Longevity of the electronic form solves the problem of

material loss.

In this case, the proponents chose Bureau of Internal Revenue ( BIR)
District office as the setting where we could conduct our study and apply our
system in accordance to its benefits. The proponents had observed that, in
the Bureau of Internal Revenue District office, many taxpayers spent longer
time just to finish processing the requirements needed for their businesses.
The proponents observed that a day is not enough to finish the requirement

that’s why people are constrained just to finish their requirements.
The Bureau of Internal-Revenue (BIR) File Tracking System is a web
application that manages all the files’ movement at any time for one
desk/room to another one and helps in managing the flow of files efficiently.
Any desk/room can receive and send request and decisions at any time. The
system follows a procedure of file unique numbering, file status monitoring,
file movement tracking and etc. It also has a very powerful search from to
locate a file and analysed the history of movement of that file. The proposed

system is also an android application for taxpayers viewing purposes.

The proponents proposed Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) File
Tracking System covers different business transaction examples like
registering of business, taxpayer identification, taxpayer and business taxable
and its process. The proposed system concentrates only to track the papers’
movement. Instead of waiting in the office just to process their papers, they
can leave their papers and continue the transaction without waiting. The
taxpayers can update their papers by viewing using an android application to
avoid queuing just to ask the updates of their papers. Bureau of Internal
Revenue file tracking system it is a system made to ease the waiting process
to clients and to avoid the office to become always crowded. To avoid paper
lost and easy to search data, the proponents made this system which primary
function is to track papers, find out the next step of the papers’ progress, and

percentage of completion.

"ANDROID FACE SWAPPING APPLICATION
","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

With the use of the Android Studio and OpenCV, the proponents were
able to create an android application that can swap faces through live camera
feed. Thus, the Proponents entitled it as the Android Face Swapping
Application. With the use of smart phones, camera manipulation by adding
photo effects became a trend, and from there, the face-swapping feature had
been born and the Proponents have thought to study it and make their own.

Through this study, the proponents have been aware that camera
manipulation is the building block of the so-called augmented reality which is
now being studied by IT professionals today. The augmented reality has a
tremendous impact to our future because it alters reality real time. For
example, an application that analyzes signboards with foreign words and
translates it to English through a live camera feed. It is an application which
can help numerous of foreign travelers that does not know any other language
than their own. Therefore, by studying the basics of the camera manipulation,
we can improve our understanding of augmented reality and maybe in the
future, the proponents can think of an application that can be beneficial to the

community.

The Android Face Swapping Application has one major feature which
is of course, to swap faces in real time. But since swapping two faces is too
common, the proponents decided to increase the number of faces to be
swapped into a minimum of three faces up to five. The proponents therefore
used the object-oriented programming as the approach in creating the
application which is best suited with the android java language.
","The camera can imitate the image of the environment. It is basically
used for production, socialization, business and other purposes. Many
applications utilize the camera to perform processes easily by taking
photos, videos and recordings. Camera can also now perform
complicated tasks, thus, Information Technology developers have
integrated art into it by using camera manipulation to create effects such

as photo filters, face detection, face swapping and much more.

Since IT developers are increasing, the number of innovations in
technologies and applications becomes greater. Due to competition,
privacy and other purposes, some processes of Creating the
technologies and applications are hidden. One of those is an innovative
app that is trending in the market nowadays is the face Swapping.
However, none of the source codes of any existing face swapping
applications such as Snapchat, Snow, Hong Chou Face Swap, Magic
Mirror and others are available for other developers to refer.
Furthermore, it has been found out that only Snapchat and Snow can

swap two or more person’s faces, while others, including the Hong Chou

Face Swap and Magic Mirror can only swap two faces.
The proponents became interested about the beauty of camera
manipulation Particularly the face swapping, face detection and image
processing. Therefore, the proponents proposed to develop “Android
Face Swapping Application” that enables users to randomly swap more
than two person’s faces in real-time face detection using android
Phone's front and back camera. Faces should be detected before being
Swapped with another. To detect a face, camera must capture any facial
landmarks such as the eyes, nose, and lips, which are all located in the

convex hull of the face.

Lastly, the study was developed to share its documentation & source
code of the algorithm of android face swapping application. The future
|.T developers can now access the source code of the algorithm of face
swapping feature. Also, the people can now enjoy swapping two or more

faces other than Snapchat and Snow.

"AN APPLICATION IN DETECTING DISEASE AND PEST INFESTATION IN
RICE PLANT USING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN)
","ABSTRACT

An Application in Detecting Disease and Pest Infestation in Rice Plant
using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), has been developed to give
solution to the Department of Agriculture Caraga Regional Office by detecting
disease rice plant and pest’s infestation in rice plant using the application. And
also, the Department of Agriculture Caraga Regional Office helps the farmers
aware of the diseases and pests attack their rice field. Furthermore, inquiry was
also included in this study to become more interactive wherein the Department
of Agriculture will help the farmers to determine their rice plant is infested with
pest and what possible disease it has. Using System Development Life Cycle
(SDLC) as a method in making the application was very useful and helpful in
identifying errors during the development. The proponents use an algorithm
which is Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that will process a photo of a rice
plant and it will serve as the detector.

","Rice is the staple food of Asia and part of the Pacific. Over 90 percent of
the world’s rice is produced and consumed in the Asia-Pacific Region.
According to the Department of Agriculture Caraga Regional Office they can
detect diseased rice plant and pest infestation in rice plant by their application.
After they detected the possible rice field that have the most infested rice plant,
they will coordinate to the owner of the rice field and they will tell if how many
percentage of the rice field has being infested but according to the farmer Mr.
Reynaldo B. Roperos, resident in Barangay Bading, said that they don’t have
any connection with the Department of Agriculture, they only do things by their
own and they could only know if the rice plant is infested by a pest is only by
touching the leaves and by checking manually with their eyes.

A pest infestation on rice plant has always resulting in enormous anxiety
on farmers because of the damaged has been cost on their rice plants. For the
past few years’ farmers have experience a difficulty on identifying on what
possible disease and pest the rice plant may have. Nowadays, they manually
monitor the rice plant through picking up some example and uses their hands
to identify the possible disease and pest that attacks on it.

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nation (UN) that
the common problem encountered by rice farmers were high cost of inputs,
low price of palay, lack of capital, labour problem, lack of postharvest, facilities,
irrigation system and the most common problem when the different pest’s are
destroying the production of rice during wet season, it causes leaf discoloration,

stunted growth, reduced tiller numbers and sterile or partly filled grains, infected
leaves turn greyish green and roll up. As the disease progresses, leaves turn
yellow to straw-colored and wilt, leading whole seedlings to dry up and die, and
It attacks different parts of the plant: the collar, which can ultimately kill the
entire leaf blade; the stem, which turns blackish and breaks easily (node blast),
the neck of the panicle, where the infected part is girdled by a greyish brown
lesion, or when severe, causes the panicles to fall over; or on the branches of
the panicles which exhibit brown lesions when infected(AGRIS et al., 2009).
Therefore, the proponent decided to develop an Application in Detecting
Disease and Pests Infestation in Rice Plant Using Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) through using an android phone to identify of particular pest

attacks that might lead to disease and pest infested

","1.1 Rationale of the Study

The World Health Organization (WHO) defined health as a state of
complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the
absence of disease or infirmity (Kuhn, S. & Rieger, U.M., 2017). The
positive concept emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as
physical capacities (Haslam, S. A., & Reynolds, K. J., 2003). This means
that health is a resource to support an individual's function in wider
society (Sharma, M., 2016). A healthful lifestyle that provides the means
to lead a full life (Nordqvist, 2017). More recently, researchers have
defined health as the ability of a body to adapt to new threats and
infirmities (Bhattacharya, N., 2019). They based this the idea on the
modem science that it has dramatically increased human awareness of
diseases and how they work in the last few decades (Nordavist, 2017).
One of the problems in health is monitoring blood pressure or
hypertension (Barnett, G. O., Winickoff, R. N., Morgan, M. M., & Zielstoff,
R. D., 1983). Blood pressure composed of two types such as systolic
pressure and diastolic pressure (Stamler, J., Stamler, R., & Neaton, J. D.,
1993). The systolic pressure is the force at which the heart pumps blood
around the body. While the diastolic pressure is the resistance of the
blood flow in the blood vessels (illiades, 2009). A blood pressure reading

between 120/80mmhg and 140/90mmhg could mean you're at risk of
The factors of having a blood pressure includes at the age of 65, being
overweight, have a family of high blood pressure, don’t do enough
exercise, drink too much alcohol or coffee, smoking, and don’t get much
sleep or have disturbed sleep (Monk, 2019). According to Food Nutrition
Research Institute(FNRI), the National prevalence of hypertension among
Filipino adults is 20 years old and over had significantly increased after a
decline in 2013 from 22.3% to 23.9% in 2015 (Aurel, 2018). The
Department of Health (DOH) also revealed that hypertension remains to
be a leading cause of illness and said to be one of the identified
precipitating factors of premature death in the Philippines (Flores, 2018).
In 2017, DOH conducted a current national survey that the total number
of hypertensive Filipinos is more than 12 million with more than half of
them are unaware of their condition and one out of four to five Filipinos in
general (Orillo, 2018). Hypertension is also one of the top causes of
premature deaths worldwide and the problem is growing (Eriksson, H.,
1995). In 2025, the World Health Organization warned that an estimated
1.56 billion adults will be living with hypertension (Agdeppa, 2016). The
traditional way of checking blood pressure is that the doctors use a
sphygmomanometer to take systolic and diastolic measurement, the
phases when the heart pumps blood and then rest (Ormon Healthcare,

2018).
ee)

The proponents proposed a system wearable blood pressure
monitoring system using Arduino in generating status report through web
portal access. To be able to monitor and know the patient's status of their
blood pressure and in addition, is to keep them updated to their condition
every day. The user cannot get any hustle when they go outside of their
house since they can wear the device wherever they will go. The relatives
can monitor their patient even the patient is not in their house. Also by the
use of the system, it tracks the current location of the user through global
positioning system or GPS. The primary goal of this study as well is to

communicate information clearly through the use of information applies.

","4.1 Rationale of the Study

Book indexing has always been a method in making a list of discussed
topics in a book. According to Hesham (2016), a book index is simply a key to
locating information found in a book. It is a method to create indexes to
provide access to detailed contents of books. Library has a collection of
documents that undergo a procedure for cataloging the bibliographic records
composed of all the basic data within a book which are then selected to be
indexed and can serve as keywords to be accessed later on Pokorny (2018).
Book indexing is a pathway that guides the person searching for related
books. According to the CSU Librarian Assistant M.G. Reyes, the importance
of the book indexing is to serve as a primary source of information on certain
topics that the researchers needs.

Two types of techniques can be used for automated book indexing: (a)
Standalone or Dedicated tools, is one of the techniques that is usually applied
for back-of-the-book indexes which permits the indexers to work from page-
numbered galleys; and (b) automated indexing software which is a tool that
now paired with most word-processing software. The outcomes are a list of
words and phrases that are applicable in the early stages of making an index.

With the use of OCR, we can easily scan the back-of-the-book indexes.

","4.1 Rationale of the Study

At present time, individuals have adjusted in modernization increases in
doing their errands. The day by day substantial outstanding task at hand and
schedules make it hard for individuals to deal with their time. With existing and
advancing innovations these days, from machines to apparatuses and cell
phones, individuals have turned to lead everyday tasks intelligently and

electronically.

The Internet of Things (loT) has been in the spotlight for the past decade. It
is regarded as one of the disruptive technologies of this century and so far, has
caught the attention of society, industry and academy as a way of
technologically enhancing day to day activities, the creation of new business
models, products and services, and as a broad source of research topics and
ideas. Several alliances, institutions, enterprises and even governments have
understood its importance and identified the potential benefits that can be
obtained from the loT, leading them to undertake strategic projects and

initiatives aiming to develop this field and profit from it (Alkhatib, 2017)

In agricultural matters, having a pig farm business arises many problem.
The manual feeding of pigs was not an easy task to do. To make it easier to the
person having pig farms, pig monitoring and automated feeding must be

utilized. A pig monitoring and automated feeding consist of a hardware that
monitors the pig and automatically refill the feeding place. It also have a mobile

application in order to notify the user.

Therefore, the researcher decided to develop An Automated Pig Feeding
with Depth Analysis using Computer Vision to solve the problem. It has a
prototype that mechanically feed the pigs in the set time and refills the water
automatically along with the computer vision, it is a module that provides the

parameter of the study.

","In this chapter are the rationale of the study, project context, purpose

and description, objectives of the study, scope and limitation.

1.1 Rationale of the Study

Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) was
established through the enactment of Republic Act. No. 7796, empowers
TESDA to establish and maintain a system of accrediting, coordinating,
integrating, monitoring and evaluating formal and non-formal technical
vocational education and training programs. The National Certificate, is an
important document needed to present in applying jobs here and abroad, it is

a graduate’s proof that her or she has passed all the trainings and

requirements set by the TESDA.

The TESDA Director Guiling Mamondiong in the year 2017 said that they
conducted inspection of training centers and they found out that sometimes
they are just sending their substitutes to train the students. Aside from that,
the assessors and trainers are being pirated by other departments. Based on
this matter the proponents decided to conduct a research and studies which

leads them to create the An Implementation of TESDA Competency-Based

Training Delivery Transaction Management System.

The training of TESDA has been managed and they conducted a

registration for the trainees and trainers. The trainers can monitor his or her
trainees all the time but they cannot monitor on time which of those trainees

are behind and need of their attention.

Therefore, the proponents’ decided to develop An Implementation of
TESDA Competency-Based Training Delivery Transaction Management
System to give them an easy way to manage their trainers and trainees. They
can managed who is that trainee that have been left behind and what part of
the Unit Competency (UC) were they consumed so much time. The system
can auto generate the other works of the trainers like checking directly the

achievement charts and the progress chart instead of manual.

"A MICRO CONTROLLER-BASED PEDESTRIAN LANE RECOGNITION

SYSTEM THROUGH IMAGE PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY WITH VEHICULAR
MOTION CONTROL
","ABSTRACT

Pedestrian road crossings have become a major issue in road
accidents, especially in urban areas where the issue of control exists. To
improve the mobility between the drivers and the cross walkers, a pedestrian
lane recognition system is necessary. Pedestrian awareness is essential for
improving road safety. Hence, the proponents came up with the idea of
pedestrian recognition system aimed to recognize the presence of pedestrian
lane and automatically performs motion control to stop whenever an obstacle
or a person crossing is detected. The purpose of this report is to provide an
overview of research studies on pedestrian safety. Raspberry Pi camera
module using the method of color thresholding is used for image processing
and classifying image as pedestrian lane or not. This identifies two-
dimensional images using RGB color model that will recognize the color
preferred by the user in the camera recognition and ultrasonic sensor. The
proponents made an analysis of the peculiarities of the task of surveillance for
pedestrian crossings and presented a pedestrian recognition system. A
thorough investigation was performed on a test image in order to validate the
system's effectiveness. The efficiency of the system is affected by real-time
processing and the error rate of recognition. In general, the system helps the
people and the drivers to cross pedestrian lane in a well-organized and more

secure way.

","4.1Rationale of the Study
Pedestrian detection has been a focus of recent research due to its
importance for practical applications such as automotive safety and visual
surveillance. The essential role of machine vision modules to realize active
safety systems for accident prevention is clearly established in academic
research and is also reflected in innovative systems introduced by industry
(K. Sri, K. Aditya, 2013). It has driven the importance of having pedestrian
lane recognition as part of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)
that are developed to automate, adapt, and enhance vehicle systems for
safety and better driving. With the progress of urbanization, there has
been a great increase in urban population density and_ traffic
infrastructures. Pedestrian crossing, as an important part of transportation
infrastructures, serves to secure pedestrians’ lives and possessions and
keep traffic flow in order (Pedestrian Lane, 2016).

As a part of important efforts in safety precautions to prevent road
traffic injuries, vehicular collisions and like other road traffic crashes,
pedestrian lane is a road infrastructure set as an indicator to the drivers to
slow down or to reduce its speed and volume (Visually Separated
Pedestrian Lane, 2009). In terms of quantifying the accident rate
depending on the type of transportation, pedestrians, who account for 41%
of the total number of victims, represent the largest number of traffic

accident victims in terms of deaths. It is well known that human errors are
the causes of :
most traffic accidents. The two main errors are drivers’

inattention and wrong driving decisions (Basam Musleh, 2010).

In the evident side along the pedestrian accidents, it initiates the
problem that every public commuter experience. From 2005 up to August
14, 2015, there were 57,877 people of whom 1,859 or 3.2% were killed,
while 56,018 or 96.7% were injured relating to the misuse of pedestrians
in Metro Manila roads. This could be translated that every pedestrian
causes one casualty and 30 injuries. A pedestrian is defined as a person

who is travelling on foot and not riding a vehicle (Thinking Machines Data
Science Inc. , 2015). Driver attitude is a main key risk. Driver behavior
particularly in terms of respect for other road users was expressed by
those surveyed while drinking and driving is cited by the World Health

Organization.

This leads the proponents to come up with a study on a micro
controller-based pedestrian lane recognition system through image
processing technology with vehicular motion control. It is a real-time
pedestrian recognition incorporating the concept of a pedestrian lane
detection system embedding image processing technology for vehicular

motion control.

","1.1 Rationale of the Study
Mobile games have been developed to be probably the largest
area within the software development industry (Hatridge, 2016). Extensive
use of mobile phones will provide the advantage of developing games
running on an android device. History provides a sense of context to our
lives and helps us to understand the way things might approach the future.
The study of history is sometimes classified as part of the humanities and
at other times as part of the social sciences. Playing mobile games
throughout learning of history can encourage people to play android games
and may give an interest in the software development industry.

Mobile games are emerging with an enormously competitive
industry and many video games are produced daily in the previous two
years (Su, 2016). Android applications are one of the most significant
innovations in the mobile industry and in the year 2016, 90% of Google Play
income originated from games (Hindy, 2017). Historical games, like many
historical movies, are brimming with precision, primarily to improve the story
in the medium and make it additionally engaging (Mclaughlin, 2015).
Incorporating history into a game requires sufficient time to research at least

some of the key facts straight. A mobile game that is blended in with history
and entertainment has additionally carried new enthusiasm to retro games

(D'Argenio, 2019).
In the study of history, effective strategies are lacking for students
to improve their learning process in history, some students may find the
study of history not interesting (Tok, 2016). They would rather hold their
mobile phones and play video games than reading books and gain some
knowledge of history. Usually in video games, the goal is to entertain people
and not prioritize giving facts about the player's history. In mobile games,
players spend long hours playing games which will result in much less time
spent studying their lessons.

A history-based game will be a bridge for the players to know
about history of a place while playing. Playing history-based games on
mobile devices might change the player’s perspective in learning about
history. The study is not only to entertain but also it helps the users to gain

knowledge about the story of Rajah Qi-ling during his era.

","1.1. Rationale of the Study

In the present day, A lot of people dreamed of a machine which could
read characters and numerals, but it seems the first OCR (Optical Character
Recognition) device was developed in the late 1920s by the Austrian engineer
Gustav Tauschek (1899-1945), who in 1929 obtained a patent on OCR (so-
called Reading Machine) in Germany, followed by Paul Handel who obtained
a US patent on OCR (so-called Statistical Machine) in the USA in 1933 (U.S.
Patent 1915993). In 1935 Tauschek was granted a US patent on his machine
(U.S. Patent 2026329). Tauschek was a genius self-taught Viennese
engineer, with more than 200 patents in the computing field to his credit, who
used to work for IBM and who besides the first OCR device, invented also
many devices and systems for the punch-card machinery, as well as the
magnetic drum-memory. The Reading Machine of Tauschek was a
mechanical device, using template matching with a photodetector
(photoelectric cell, marked with 5 on the patent drawing). A picture containing
a text passed in front of the reading machine's window (marked with 1). The
comparison device was a disk (or a wheel, marked with 6) (which had holes in
the form of letters) rotating from the interior side of the objective lens (3). When
images and letter-shaped holes coincided in form, the click work rotated the

printing drum to the required letter, and this letter is printed on paper.
OCR traces its roots back to telegraphy. On the eve of the First World
War, physicist Emanuel Goldberg invented the machine that could read
characters and convert them into telegraph code. In the 1920s, he went a step
further and created the first electronic document retrieval system. At this time,
businesses were microfilming financial records — great in principle, but quickly
retrieving specific records from spools of the film was nigh on impossible. To
overcome this, Goldberg used a photoelectric cell to do pattern recognition
with the help of a movie projector. By repurposing existing technologies, he
took the first steps towards the automation of record keeping. The US patent
for his “Statistical Machine” was later acquired by IBM. Since then, OCR
technology has proliferated, with businesses all over the world relying on it to

help reduce overheads when it comes to converting and extracting data from

paper documents.

Therefore, we have decided to develop a web-based system that may
be of service of assisting the researcher or a user in which text images are
converted into machine-encoded text to provide Digitizing text means it can

be easily presented, edited, stored, and searched.

","1.1 Rationale of the Study
Artificial Intelligence is an area of computer science that deals with the

ability to mimic the human brain. Al systems typically demonstrate some
behaviors associated with human intelligence such as planning, learning,
reasoning, problem solving, knowledge representation, perception, motion, and
manipulation. Artificial Intelligence must access its relations, objects,
categories and properties in order to implement the knowledge engine of an
Expert System (Techpedia, 2019).

Chatbot is an automated messaging software which also uses artificial
intelligence (Al) in conversing with people. There are various expert system
and chatbots were created but some of it are not free to access. Users’
messages containing pediatric concerns can be simply recognize through an
expert system chatbot.

Pediatrics is a branch of medicine that involves medical care of infants,
children, and adolescents. Pediatrics treats and diagnoses conditions among
children such as infections and developmental-behavioral disorder (Mandal,
2019).

A pediatric chatbot that uses artificial intelligence in conversing with
people can be useful in this technological era. In order to cater messages from
the users, chatbots are programmed to understand questions, provide answers,

and execute tasks that resembles speaking to a real person (Cooper, 2019).
Parents lack in knowledge on handling pediatric problems which lead
them to having difficulties in dealing their situation. Parent's availability of time
and money lead them on having inconvenience to get an expert to handle their
concerns. With these inconvenience and lack of knowledge, they cannot
simply find answers, suggestions and remedies with regards to handling
pediatric concerns.

DrPedia is a Facebook Messenger Chatbot that caters ten pediatric
illnesses. Users can now send their pediatric problems through DrPedia.
DrPedia will process their concerns with the use of Backward Chaining and
Deep Learning Algorithm to cater users messages. Users can receive

suggestions and recommendations based on the matter that they relay to

DrPedia. DrPedia is free to access due to the availability and accessibility of

vastly used Facebook Messenger.

"VEHICULAR LOCKING SYSTEM WITH REAL-TIME LOCATION
MONITORING USING GPS AND ARDUINO
","vi

Abstract

Vehicular Locking System with Real-Time Location Monitoring using
GPS and Arduino has been developed to give locking system and monitoring
system and to help the vehicular owners in Butuan City because of the fast-
growing populating of vehicle owners. This study focuses on locking,
monitoring and give messaging command (via SMS) that communicate with
the vehicular owner to update the vehicle owners from theft or unwanted
access to the vehicle. Furthermore, an inquiry was also included in this study
to become more interactive wherein individuals in the community could
inquire the actual vehicle status and the owners can also turn on and off the
SMS notification alert through SMS keyword. The vehicle can be monitored
through the web application. Using the System Development Life Cycle
(SDLC) as a method in making the software was very useful and helpful in
identifying errors during the development. The following technologies like
Arduino Uno, GSM and Buzzer are used in making the prototype. The
proponents conducted a survey for the software quality of the system to the
vehicular owners and was highly acceptable based on the total mean
obtained of 4.1956. The prototype was indeed useful to the vehicular owners
because it helps them to monitor the vehicle in the situation if someone else’s
in the family used it. This eliminates the manual way of locating the vehicle
real-time and late receiving of SMS warning of the vehicular owners. It was
relevant and important as per the needs for safety and welfare of the
community.

","4.1 Rationale of the Study
Car vehicle is one of the most valued possessions nowadays and having
one of this in the Philippines most specially to ordinary company employee is
very difficult to become a reality and losing it is really a cruel imagination if it
happens. Therefore, looking for other means of securing cars from theft using
the present technology (Laguador, J.M., et al 2013).

In recent years theft has been seriously increased and there is no safety
for people and their properties. Security plays a vital role in monitoring a
building in the absence or presence of people. Theft refers to the crime
involving the taking of a person's property without their permission. Most of the
theft happens by door break-ins. 75% of theft occurs during night time. The thief
may take off the fuse, so they cannot be easily identified and if they caught,
they can be easily escaped (Deepika, S. et al, 2015).

Based in Camp Crame, January 5 to September 6, 214 vehicles were
stolen on the streets while 140 forcibly taken from their owners in residential
areas (villages and subdivisions). These represent 44% and 29%, respectively,
of a total of 489 reported carnapping cases. With Directorate for Investigation
and Detective Management (DIDM) records that show 64% of carnapping
incidents during said period happened between 12:01 and 8: 00 in the morning
(Gonzales, S., 2015).

With the fast-growing population of vehicle owners, it is difficult to locate

one to others manually. With the help of a vehicular locking system with real-
time location monitoring using GPS and Arduino, it presents an easy way of
tracking the vehicle speed and location. It also provides remote access to the
vehicle that the owner has the privilege to stop the vehicle when it will be stolen
and activating the emergency alarm by SMS.

GPS, or the Global Positioning System, is a global navigation satellite
system that uses at least 24 satellites, a receiver and algorithms to provide
location, velocity and time synchronization for air, sea and land travel. The
satellite system consists of six earth-centered orbital planes, each with four
satellites. GPS works at all times and in almost all weather conditions. This post
answers “What is GPS?” and explains how it works. In general, there are five
key uses of GPS: Location, Navigation, Tracking, Mapping, and Timing. (Keyes
J. et al, 2017)

Meanwhile, Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on
easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs -
light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message and turn it into an
output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online.
You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the
microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming
language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on
Processing.

Thus, the combination of GPS using Arduino, is relevant to create a tool
in which every vehicular user can use as a locator of the vehicles. With this, it
can allow you to get a real-time view of the position, route, and time of travel in
any vehicle, allowing you to get an understanding of the location of any vehicle

in your fleet, no matter how big or how small. In addition to these features, the
proponents aim to include the remote feature of the system in which the user
can remotely stop the vehicle in case of an unauthorized user of the vehicle.
Hence, the study aimed to provide a solution to the problem concerning the

rampant vehicle theft on the community.

data gathered from the internet and conducted a survey to assess the quality
of the system — to a fifty (50) respondents composed of eighteen (18) car
owners, ten (10) car renter and twenty-two (law enforcers). The assessment
accumulated 4.13 total mean, equivalent to highly acceptable. The device is
indeed an ideal solution to help the prevention of vehicle collisions — enables
the drivers to communicate and transmit information towards the other vehicle.

","4.1 Rationale of the Study

Road is a place where people uses their vehicles like motor vehicle,
bicycle and cart to transport people, items and many more from one place to
another. There are different names for roads few of them are controlled-access
highway, toll road and avenues (Road, July 2019). Road transport is basically
the main form of transportation and it actually plays a vital role in humans’ daily
life —it is actually used by people to make a living (Labana A, etal., 2015). Road
accidents happen more often than people could have ever imagine and it is
undoubtedly the cause of the most damage (ICDO 2019). According to Thomas
Watteyne (March 2018), road crashes and the damage they entail represent a
serious issue and are one of the main causes of death. Also, according to the
National Highway Traffic Administration (NHTSA), car accidents occur every
minute of the day. A vehicle collision occurs when two or more vehicles bump
into each other and sometimes to road obstacles such as animals, tree and
utility pole. Vehicle collisions can lead minor to major injury, death and property

damage (Traffic Collision, June 2019).

Every year, there are 1.25 million people around the world are dying
because of the global problem which is the road crashes, both predictable and
preventable phenomena (Sy K., April 2017). That is why Garret Morgan and
J.P Knight invented the traffic light to improve and facilitate the safe movement

of automobiles and avoid collisions. Individuals who owns a car is required to
attend a seminar and driving lessons before they can acquire their driving
license. Also, there are several topics that tackles about safety driving on the
internet that can actually help vehicle drivers drive and get those people on
board safe and sound. Safety should always be the vehicular drivers’ primary
concems when they are driving especially when they are with their families and
friends or transporting passengers or children to their respective school or
destination.

Even having enough knowledge about safe driving and no matter how
careful those drivers drove their vehicles; accidents still insist to occur. Some
statistics have shown that the majority of road accidents usually happen
because of human error and sixty percent (60%) of these could've have been
evaded if only the driver had been notified a bit earlier (Watteyne T., March
2018). The few human errors are namely; the other driver didn’t see that they
were at a four-way stop and ignored the stop sign, a vehicle is attempting to
turn right off a single carriageway, while a vehicle behind is attempting to
overtake, someone missed the red light or didn’t see the stop sign on the road
and poorly designed roads or intersections (Tario M., April 2017). Whatever the
cause of the accident, the results are almost always the same which is injury or
worse — death.

Since these accidents can be preventable, the proponents came up with
the idea of developing a vehicle to vehicle communication for automobile
collision avoidance using ad-hoc network. A device which will enable vehicle
drivers to communicate with each other by sending and exchanging data such
as the vehicle speed, predefined messages, the current location of the vehicle

which will become a guide to help avoid a potential collision.

"A SYSTEM FOR GROUND SHAKING DETECTION & EMBEDMENT OF
DYNAMIC SAFETY MECHANISM IN BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURES
","Ground shaking is one of the effects of an earthquake. This describes
the vibration of the ground during an earthquake which is an unpredictable
phenomenon. The Philippines is vulnerable to calamities because it Is part of
the pacific ring of fire and most of our resources for calamity preparation are
not much on earthquake events. The shaking and moving of the ground from
earthquakes are not predictable, but it can be measured. Seismic activity, which
is the shaking of the ground, is measured by seismographs. The proposed work
is to design a system that can detect ground shaking and provide a dynamic
safety mechanism for building infrastructures. The system will estimate the local
seismic intensity of the ground shaking at the particular location of the
instrument. To determine the magnitude of the shaking the researchers used
the ADXL335 three-axis accelerometer. This sensor can measure the static
acceleration of gravity in tilt-sensing applications, as well as dynamic
acceleration resulting from motion, shock, or vibration and use Arduino UNO as
its main controller. It is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-
use hardware and software and applies the 3-dimensional vector formula to get
the seismograph reading of the shaking. It also applies the Richter scale
formula to calculate the approximate magnitude. The system provides an alarm
signal and safety mechanisms to a building like automatically opening doors
and activating guiding lights. Those dynamic safety mechanisms will trigger the
approximated threshold. Optimistically, the system should help to reduce the

number of injuries and casualties due to its capabilities during a ground-shaking
situation. ,

","1.1 Rationale of the Study

The geographical location of the Philippines in the Pacific makes the
country highly susceptible to natural hazards such as earthquakes. The country
is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, “an area encircling the Pacific Ocean where
earthquakes and volcanic activity result from the movements of tectonic plates.”
(Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2008). Because man has no control
over earthquakes, they must be considered it as unavoidable events
(International Civil Defense Organization [ICDO], n.d.). According to the book,
“Living on an Active Earth: Perspectives on Earthquake Science” that the
preparation and rapid emergency response are therefore the bulwarks of a
good seismic defense (National Research Council, 2003).

Butuan City Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council (BCDRRMC)
stated that most of the resources of the DRRM is focused on mitigating flooding
but not much on earthquake preparedness. At present, the preparedness plan
initiated for earthquake events is training for Basic Life Support and Fire Drill.
The government's response to disaster is focused on mostly emergency relief
measures. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology
(PHIVOLCS) mandates services for a warning, disaster preparedness, and
mitigation, but they only provide a wide scale of information. So, in that matter,
having the idea of adding technical measures, the proponents realize how
beneficial a system to a building that can detect an approximate level of ground

shaking and can provide dynamic safety mechanisms.
By considering the Philippines ' geographical location and by conducting
research and studies in some residents in Butuan City, the proponents intend
to develop a system which can be used and beneficial to buildings and houses
in Butuan, which lead them to create a System for Ground Shaking Detection

& Embedment of Dynamic Safety Mechanism in Building Infrastructures.

detected over the fence by sending an alarm to the web application and also
sending SMS notification to the owner of the building and house. The study was
conducted for the purpose of finding an alternative solution for the problem of

intruder detection that would automatically detect fence intruder in the business
buildings and houses who have fences in their properties. The new developed
system must be evaluated in terms of functionality, reliability, efficiency and
usability. By developing the system, the water fall development model was used
in order not proceed to the next development phase if the first phase is not yet
finished. The system and prototype were improved and implemented into an
imbedded system to benefit people who has fences to their homes and
business buildings. In addition, it can be an efficient solution to the risk of every

","1.1 Rationale of the Study

Security allows clear surveillance to those entering and leaving the
grounds. Locking security gates allow staff to verify visitors, this is integral for
controlling unauthorized departure of students (Start Web Solution, 2019).
Nowadays, reliable, trusted home and properties are essential to ensure the
safety of people and lot. Fence is the first and basic security a house and
business building should have but thieves, burglars and intruders are not
scared to trespass anymore. The latest FBI Uniform Crime reporting Statistic,
property crime rates including burglary, larceny and vehicle thief. There are
roughly 2.5 million burglars a year 66% of those being home break-ins and only
13% of those are solved by the police due to lack of witness or physical
evidence and as stated there are 1,495,790 burglaries during the day and break
ins are 6% more likely to occur during the day where no one is home and
1,324,090 during the night. (The National Council for Home Safety and

Security, 2019)

Anyone wants a safe home, properties and offices. The Self-Organizing
Map Classifier for Vision Based Auto intruder detection embracing the method
of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) will offer a remarkable result in defending the
residence, stuffs and also the properties from thieves, intruders or burglars. The
training of the self-organizing map is based on the random presentation of

Several input vectors one at a time (Baese, A., Schmid, V., 2014). Crime is
increasing as day by day; thus, the demand of trusted, and reliable security
system is increasing. Many home securities have proven effective in preventing
home burglaries (Talorete, V. and Guirnaldo S., 2016). A home without a
security systems are 300% more likely to be burglarized and 83% of home
burglars admitted that they look specifically if there is an alarm and 60% of them
would change their mind if there was one installed (Charlotte, 2019) . Self-
organizing map is essential to the developed study because it is a powerful
paradigm that is extensively applied for clustering and visualization purpose

and data analysis in various domains (ESANN, 2015).

Self-organizing map is an unsupervised neural network that reduces the
input dimensionally in order to represent its distribution as a map (Big data and

Smart Services System, 2017).

Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) are most commonly used security in
homes, stores, bank and businesses but the disadvantages is they can only
monitor in limited areas and cannot give warning or alarm if there is burglar
caught by the cameras and some criminals can vandalize the cameras or

sticking gums in it (Leaf Group Ltd., 2019)

Walls or fences in a required front yard building setback, including walls
for single-family dwellings, shall be four (4) feet maximum in height. An increase
in the maximum four (4) foot height may be permitted subject to a use permit.
With a use permit, the maximum height may be up to six (6) feet, except that
an additional two (2) feet of height may be permitted for architectural
features including but not limited to archways, pergolas, and other similar

features. For all heights above four (4) feet, the use permit shall demonstrate
that a natural surveillance to the street will be maintained by incorporating
Openings, providing transparent materials, or varying height/materials(City

Hall, 31 E. 5th St., Tempe, AZ 85281).

The proponents come up with this study to help the residents,
businesses and property owners in securing their buildings and houses. The
proponents want to develop a security system that aimed to detect the fence
intruder and directly send warning alarm notification to the owner or assigned

personnel and to help the assigned person for much easier in supervising the

properties and home.

","1.1 Rationale of the Study

In the last decade, independent or “indie” games have emerged
as a potent force for creativity and a counterbalance to conventional
Triple-A video games with big budgets. The indie industry is generally
described as fortunate, as Dale North at VentureBeat (2015) suggests:

‘Indie outfits can afford to try new, untested game-making approaches

as they probably have no one to answer to but themselves.” The

emergence and popularity of high-profile titles, especially Minecraft

(2011), as well as the acclaimed documentary exploring a few
developers’ lives—Indie Game: “The Movie (2012)”. All of these signal a
trend towards an explosion of independent titles from all over the world.
All of this coincides with the rapid democratization of game production
tools and knowledge, with major multi-platform professional engines like
Unreal and Unity becoming free for many new developers. However, as
the independent sector has significantly expanded, independent game
development’s economics and labor conditions have often been ignored

or inaccurately conflated with legal development needs. Nadav D. Lipkin

(2019).

Mobile learning and educational gaming are two trends that are
rapidly having an increasing impact on Technology-Enhanced Learning

However, both approaches present significant technological challenges
Mobile t
echnologies are very diverse, and the market pressure

gushes the
f continuous development of new technologies and features.

Pablo Lavin-Mera, et al. (2017)

Butuan Throughout the years: A mobile time travel game to
Butuan’s rich history. It is an android-based mobile game, developed not
only as a game entertainment but also to introduce the meaningful
history of Butuan. The proponents are to learn the history of Butuan ina

","1.1 Rationale of the Study

In most hospital facilities, manual monitoring has been their preference and
practice. The doctors or nurses, hour by hour, or even minute by minute, check
on their individual patients’ condition directly. Today, direct contact with
individuals is not safe because of the pandemic brought about by a dangerous
virus called Corona Virus Disease 19 (COVID-19). This pandemic is happening

in almost all of the countries in the world, including ours.

The Internet of Things (loT) has been in the spotlight for the past decade. It
is regarded as one of the disruptive technologies of this century and so far, has
caught the attention of society, industry, and academy as a way of
technologically enhancing day to day activities, the creation of new business
models, products, and services, and as a comprehensive source of research
topics and ideas. Several alliances, institutions, enterprises, and even
governments have understood its importance and identified the potential
benefits obtained from the loT, leading them to undertake strategic projects and

initiatives to develop this field and profit from it (Alkhatib, 2017).

In hospital facility matters, having a high number of patients increases the
number of difficulties in checking the patient, heartbeat, temperature, etc. To
make it easier for the Doctor or Nurses, real-time patient heartbeat and

temperature monitoring must be utilized. A patients’ real-time heartbeat and
temperature monitoring consist of hardware that monitors the patient. It also

has a web page to notify the user.

Therefore, the researcher decided to develop the Doctor Assistant: loT in
the Health Sector using a Heartbeat sensor, Blood pressure monitor,
Glucometer, and Temperature sensor with notification to solve the problem. It
has a prototype that monitors the patient's heartbeat, blood sugar, blood
pressure, and temperature and notifies the user. It has a module that provides

the parameter of the study.

"MEDICAL AND LABORATORY RECORDS AND ARCHIVING SYSTEM
WITH DATA ANALYSIS
","ABSTRACT

Information Technology also plays important role in terms of healthcare
procedure. This paper focuses on expanding healthcare information because it
IS one of having important function in this society which could also help the
medication in much easier way. As the researcher observed, in such clinic
medication there are some of them still using manual system while the
communication technologies had a significant impact on healthcare and the
delivery of health services. Thus the technologies have the ability to create,
transmit, store and manage individual’s health data. The main purpose of this
Study is to assess some medical process to adopt at least the benefits of using
technologies that can improve operational and administrative efficiencies
including clinical outcomes, documentation and information flow of a clinic
services. Furthermore, the ability for patients to obtain information to better
manage their condition and to communicate with the health system can also
improve the efficiency and quality of care. Information technology allows
healthcare providers to collect, store, retrieve, and transfer information
electronically. However adoption and benefits have not been uniformly
distributed and reliability of success has been difficult, therefore it is necessary
to improve the quality, cost, efficiency and capacity of the healthcare service.
While having the develop project been found functional, reliable, and efficient
on the total mean of 4.34 4.43 4.53 4.43 respectively. Moreover Information

","1.1 Rationale of the Study

A critical aspect of our culture is healthcare. In other words, one of the
most critical issues is health services. In recent times, the people's health care
concept has undergone a tremendous change, which has led to higher
expectations and increased demand for high-quality medical care and facilities.
The clinic is responsible for providing health medication and treatment for all
types of people. Healthcare organizations of all sizes face a critical need to
manage and integrate clinical and operational information.

Many clinics in our country are currently storing patients' records by
using paper or card manual systems. Nurses Need to write down the patient
information for registration and index the patients’ medical. After the
registration, the patient's files will be kept in the rack, which will cause problems.
Moreover, patients' information is not secure and will cause issues like taking a
long time to retrieve the data.

Clinics need to take security seriously, considering the sensitive
information and large volume of traffic they handle. The institutions must also
comply with strict privacy standards such as the Health Information Technology
for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act that came into effect in
February 2009. The act provides more muscle to the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). HITECH implements new standards
for electronic health records security and includes notification requirements for

healthcare data breaches.
In this study, the proponents' objective is to develop a web-based
application that allows the clinic to monitor its patient's information. The
proponents' came up with this idea to enable the clinic to manage and monitor
its transactions quickly. In this way, the clinic's business becomes efficient and

reliable in giving services and processing documents to the patient.

"MATH GT: A Motorcycle Anti-Thief with Helmet Alcohol Detection and
GPS Tracker
","Nowadays, the motorcycle is the primary way of transportation, and most
of the countries, especially the Philippines, are enforcing their cities to wear a
helmet when driving a bike. In Caraga Region, According to the traffic section
police station in Butuan City. Seventy-two accidents are recorded in 2017
because the person is under the influence of an alcohol. She/he is not allowed
to drive, but still, these rules are being violated, and one of the major problems
is the increasing rate of motor vehicle theft in the country. The study sought to
develop and incorporate the use of (MATH GT) A Helmet Alcohol Detection
Motorcycle Anti-Thief and GPS Tracker in riding a motorcycle. It has an
intelligent device installed in the helmet and the vehicle, using the (MATH GT)
cell phone application to operate and control the system, has a theft safety
system. It communicates with the vehicle units to switch off the ignition and
alarming system of the vehicle if there is a threat or if it is in a dangerous
situation, the helmet alcohol detector ensures that the rider is not in the
influence of alcohol with the help of the (MQ3) alcohol sensor. Using the (GPS
gf-07), the rider can be traced immediately if an accident or the motorcycle has
been stolen. This system aims to help our fellow riders ensure their safety and
assist them in their protection and motorcycle. The proponents decided to use
the Rapid Application Development model, which involves fast phase
development with an iterative process. The proponents also used Survey
Questionnaire as a tool for data gathering. The survey resulted in a mean Of

Keywords: Mobile Application, Alcohol Detector, GPS Tracker.
","1.1 Project context

One of the most country with motorbike users in Southeast Asia is
probably the Philippines because of its abundance and sudden rise in number.
The motorbike is probably the most popular and easiest way of transportation
for every Filipinos; most in every place in the country, you can see a motorcycle
in every comer, but it has also been the common target of thieves. According
to the National Capital Region Police Office's (NCRPO) Regional Investigation
and Detection Management Division ( RIDMD), it has been reported that in
2015, over 3000 motorcycles has been stolen from January to March alone,
and has shown a massive jump of 11.89% from statistic during the same period
from the previous year with only a little 2500 units were taken. According to the
Highway Patrol Group (HPG), about 150 motorcycles are stolen every week in
Metro Manila alone, or an estimated average of 21 per day. The spokesman
superintendent Elizabeth Velazquez of HPG also stated that in 2014, 11, 870
motorcycles were stolen, while 10, 771 were taken in 2013. In Caraga Butuan
City, based on the record of the Traffic Section of Butuan City Police, 74
accidents are recorded in 2017 due to drunk driving. According to the recent
study, Motorcycle Theft Prevention and Recovery Security System (Publish in
2017) by Archie O. Pachica, Dhave S. Barsalote, Jessy Mae P. Geraga,
Jhestine M. Ong, and Michael D. Sajulan. Transportation plays a big part in our

daily lives. Every year, people in the Philippines are increasingly using vehicles,
especially motorcycles, as their common means of transportation. Together
with the increase of motorcycle users, motorcycle theft is also rampant over the
years. Their study developed a system for the theft prevention and recovery of
the motorcycle more comfortably and faster. The user will be noticed through
an alert once the motorcycle has been moved in a long-distance or stolen. The
user could also view the current location, shut down the engine, and capture
the thief's image. The hardware component includes a micro-controller, GSM,
GPS, and a camera. The software component is the mobile application, which
is the medium of communication of the user to the motorcycle and serves as
the main controller of their entire system. To differentiate from the previous
research, we use the GPS, GSM, and Microcontroller to prevent motorcycle
theft. The proposed of the MATH GT is to notify the owner when the motorcycle

has been stolen. And reduce road accidents due to alcohol intake.

Introduction

This year 2020, the world experiences what could be the most
devastating pandemic in human history bought by COVID-19. Currently,
the situation remains fluid, and countries and nations still struggle to
contain the problem. According to the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, the Philippines is one of the worst-hit countries in
Southeast Asia. It ranks number 1 in the most number of infected cases.
Corona-virus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a
newly discovered coronavirus. This virus's infection rate is incredibly high
and is an airborne disease as of recent studies. The people who are
heavily affected by this virus are mainly the elderly and teenagers, albeit
to a lesser degree, affected by this. It has even come to the point that
citizens are always forced to carry hand sanitizer and wear surgical masks
whenever they go outside. With the increasing demand for alcohols and
sanitizers creating a scarcity, most people cannot bring them everywhere.
According to a recent study by G. Kampf (2020), The corona-virus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a massive demand for
alcohol-based hand rubs, medical gloves, face masks, and gowns in
healthcare and from the public. The current shortage of some articles is
so profound that it results in uncertainty among healthcare workers
(HCWs) about whether it is safe for them to care for COVID-19 patients.

According to market research from Nielsen, the sale of hand sanitizers
skyrocketed by 300% and 470% in the last week of February and the rest
week of March 2020, respectively, compared to the same time the
previous year. The difference of the proposed system from the previous
similar machines, such as a soap dispenser, the system can release a
disinfecting mist after supplying the passenger with the freehand sanitizer
and temperature scanner. The proposed system, AFAtay: An Portable
Sanitation and Disinfection System for Public Vehicular Transport
Utilization, will provide a way for passengers with no things such as
checking the temperature with the thermal scanner and sanitizers or
alcohol a way to disinfect themselves upon boarding the bachelor. After
supplying the passenger with the hand sanitizer, a mist will be
automatically released by the machine to disinfect them further. By doing
this, the risk of COVID-19 being passed on to passengers would be

reduced.

"SMART BLIND STICK
","ABSTRACT

The Smart Blind Stick is based on ultrasonic sensors and Arduino for visually
impaired individuals. People with visual impairments frequently rely on outside
assistance, which can come from humans, trained dogs, or unique electronic devices
that act as decision-making aids. As a result, we were inspired to create a smart blind
stick to help people overcome their constraints. We achieved this goal by placing
ultrasonic sensors and water sensors in strategic locations on the stick, which
activated the sound and conveyed information about the environment to the user. We
presented a low-cost, lightweight device with a microprocessor that analyses signals
and notifies visually impaired people to any obstacles, water, or dark places by using
the LED lights to enable them to be recognized by others. The system comprises
obstacle and moisture detection sensors that receive, process, and send signals to an
alarm system, which then notifies the user.

","1.1 Rationale of the Study

Visually impaired people are perplexed by society and fearful of their
surroundings. They wanted to stay at home rather than go out most of the time. They
may cause problems for others as a result of this.

James Biggs, a photographer from Bristol who went blind following an accident
and was concerned about the quantity of traffic near his home, decided to paint his
walking stick white to make it more noticeable. Guilly d'Herbemont founded a
national white stick movement for blind persons in France. In the presence of
numerous French ministers, he symbolically presented the first two white canes to
blind individuals; 5,000 more white canes were eventually sent to blind French
veterans of World War I and blind citizens (WCBlind Org., 2019). The white blind
stick has been around for generations, allowing blind or visually impaired to walk
around securely and freely wherever they want to go. This item also serves as a
visible cue to others that the user is blind or visually impaired.

Dealing with vision loss or low vision is just one of the hurdles or issues that

the visually impaired face in everyday life. Blind people are basically like everyone
else, except they can't sce. The most challenging thing for them is to navigate
locations, especially if they have completely lost their vision (WeCapable, 2021).

Their main issue is that they are concerned about their safety while moving
around or traveling alone (R. Abbas, et al., 2016). They have minimal interaction with
the world around them. Physical movement is difficult for visually impaired people
since it is difficult for them to discern barriers in front of them, and they are unable to
go from one location to another. For movement and financial assistance, they rely on
their family. Their impairment prevents them from engaging with others and
participating in social activities (D.Sathya, et al., 2018).

In the Philippines, an estimated 332,150 people are bilaterally blind, with
cataracts accounting for 33% (109,619), errors of refraction (EOR) accounting for
25% (83,037), and glaucoma accounting for 14% (46,501). Glaucoma, retinopathy,
and maculopathy are among the remaining eye diseases. In addition to these numbers,
the Department of Health reports that there are presently 2,179,733 people with low
bilateral vision, with EOR accounting for 43% (937,285), cataracts for 34%

(741,109), and glaucoma and other eye disorders accounting for the rest (2017).

The blind stick serves as much more than a guide or a warning device. It gives
blind individuals access to four important developmental areas that are the most
impacted by the handicap. It's a critical developmental tool for a person's
neurodevelopment, which includes sensory, physical, social, and emotional

development (Braille Works, 2021). Therefore, the proponent decided to use Arduino
to create a Smart Blind Stick that can detect impediments and assist blind people in

navigating without assistance.

A water sensor uses to detect potholes and flooded regions, GPS for their
location. The location message tracker sends a message to the user's guardian.
informing them of their present location. In addition, the guardian will be confident in
their situation and will be able to follow their location, if necessary. A camera was
also included to capture their current state, a headphone for voice communications to
keep the user awake in the assured clear distance ahead to avert any potential
accidents en route. In addition, there is a LED light used at night and in emergencies.
All of this allows them to move independently and safely while avoiding tripping

dangers such as cracks, poles, and other obstacles.

"AD-HOC BASED VEHICLE TRACKING SYSTEM
","ABSTRACT

Car-napping remained most prevalent. Car manufacturers continuously work
hard to improve the security features of their products. This is the primary reason why
most car owners nowadays decide to invest in third-party anti-theft devices to protect
their vehicles. Unfortunately, carnappers are keeping up. Motor vehicles are the
primary mode of transportation for most of us and are often an indispensable part of
our lives. Car-related thefts are among the most common offenses calling for a police
response. The lack of information regarding the location of the stolen vehicle and the
slow initial investigation time made the process of finding the vehicle difficult. The
vehicle tracking system is a complete fleet management and security solution. The
proponents came up with the idea of developing an Ad-hoc based Vehicle Tracking
System. This device will enable the users to detect the stolen vehicle at the moment
the ad-hoc tracking device pairs up. The device will send the time of detection via
message to the other device, which will be displayed on the LCD monitor of the
receiving device.

KEYWORD: Ad-hoc Network, Hardware, Vehicle Tracking System, LCD, Python.
","1.1 Rationale of the Study

The vehicle tracking System is a complete fleet management and security solution.

It is the technology that determines a vehicle’s location using various methods such as

GPS and other navigation systems that operate via satellite and ground-based stations.
Modern vehicle tracking systems use GPS technology to track and find our vehicles
anywhere on the planet, but other types of automatic vehicle location technology are
sometimes used as well. The vehicle tracking system is installed inside the vehicle
and provides accurate real-time location information. The data can also be saved and
downloaded to a computer for later analysis. This System is a must-have for tracking
a car whenever the owner wishes to keep an eye on it, and it is becoming incredibly
popular among those who own expensive cars for theft prevention and recovery. The
information gathered can be viewed on electronic maps using software and the
Internet (Techtarget, 2019). A vehicle tracking system combines the installation of an
electronic device in a vehicle with custom software that allows the owner to watch the
vehicle while gathering data from the field and delivering it to the base of operations.

comprises three major components: a vehicle unit, a fixed-based station, and

database with software (N. Hlaing et al., 2019).
In the world of transportation, it benctits from knowing the advantages of the
emerging GPS and tracking technology (Teletrac Navman, 2021.) There are many
different reasons to purchase tracking systems fora fleet of vehicles. Being able to
map out the locations of your fleet means that you will always know who is closest to
that vital job. The tracking system will allow any stolen vehicle to be tracked around
the country and therefore ensure that it is retuned in the quickest amount of time.
Many businesses rely ona Speedy response to ensure that their customers are happy
with the service that they receive. Customer service is the one aspect that a business
can still stand out in and having a tracking device will ensure that vehicles can be
monitored and stationed in the correct places to respond to any customer requests
(Post Tracking America, 2020).

Car manufacturers continuously work hard to improve the security features of
their products. Unfortunately, carnappers are keeping up. This is the primary reason
why most car owners nowadays decide to invest in third-party anti-theft devices to
protect their vehicles. Carnapping remained most prevalent in Metro Manila with the
National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) having eight cases. followed by
Central Visayas Police Regional Office (PRO-7) with four cases: Central Luzon
(PRO-3) with three cases; Northern Mindanao (PRO-10) with two cases; and
Cordillera (PRO-COR) and Socesksargen (PRO-12) with one case cach. Philippines
private car theft rate was at a level of 4.6 cases per 100,000 population in 2018. from
6.2 cases per 100,000 population previous year, this is a change of 25.81%. (PNP
highway patrol group, 2019). Vehicle Security is a primary concern for all vehicle

owners. Owners as well as researchers are always looking for new and upgraded
vehicle security systems. Motor vehicles are the primary mode of transportation for
most of us, and often an indispensable part of our lives. Car-related thefts are among
the most common offenses calling for a police response. The lack of information
regarding the location of the stolen vehicle and the slow initial investigation time
made the process of finding the vehicle difficult. To assist the search process, an
additional device is needed on the vehicle as a location information provider (P.K.

"Web-Based Calamity Assistance Locator
","ABSTRACT

The Web-based Calamity Assistance Locator is a web-based system that can
help people during calamities like earthquakes and flooding. The system can be
accessed through a smartphone connected to the internet. The user/evacuees are
required to fill in the required information and then choose the barangay where they
are registered. After registering, the user must log in and select the type of calamity,
such as a flood or an earthquake. A list of suggested areas will be shown. The
advantage of the system is that, it recognizes the health condition (c.g. with health
condition, pregnant or PWD (Person with Disability)) of the users, which allows them
to find an evacuation facility that is suitable for them, and to have a standard capacity
in every evacuation facility. Upon reservation, the user can click the button to view
the larger map, which directs the mobile device to the GPS and shows the route to the
assigned location. The minimum requirement of the mobile phone for the system Is at
least 2GB of RAM and must have an operating system (OS) version of Marshmallow
v.6.0 API level 23 or any higher version in order to have smooth and efficient
performance when you use It.

KEYWORD: Web-Based Calamity Locator, Calamities, Evacuation Facility, GPS

","1.1 Rationale of the Study

The City of Butuan is one of the arcas in the Philippines that always and
frequently experience flooding when heavy and extreme rainfall scenarios occur in
the arca. It is located at the Agusan Valley, Mindanao, sprawling across. It is bounded
to the north, west, and south by Agusan del Norte, the cast by Agusan del Sur, and the
northwest by Butuan Bay. (Joy C. Casinginan, 2017) . The city's geographic location
suggests rigorous preparation for the unexpected hazards that will probably strike.
Records of typhoons that have struck Butuan City are noted, especially Tropical
Depression Agaton and Seniang. Accessibility to transportation during the flood event
is difficult. Because this natural phenomenon can result in significant loss of lives and
properties, preparation is best applied before this Calamity occurs. Most government
agencies, especially the Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DRRM) Offices,
initiate various programs to improve their services to their respective locale. Since
technology is now on the verge of making human life more manageable and
performing digital processes and automation, the use of technologies to change and
enhance the systems and protocols of the CGB is deemed necessary. (Alexander T.

Demetillo, 2016)
According to Queenie Lozada and Gino Abatayo, residents of Baan River
Side, most of them are unaware of the location and availability of Evacuation
Facilities suitable for the evacuees’ familics' health situation. According to their
experience, being an evacuee is difficult, especially when the evacuation center is
overcrowded. Crystal Palado, one of the residents of Barangay Mahogany, also stated
that most of them are aware of the common evacuation center on their barangay.
However, they are unsure if that particular evacuation is safe, still available, and
appropriate for their family's health situation. Based on_ their experience during
Calamity, the evacuees fully occupied the evacuation center. The elderly and sick
individuals share the same room. Individuals are just putting up tents in the corners to

provide shelter during others.

The proponents decided to develop a Web-Based Calamity Assistance Locator
system that uses GPS to help the residents and provide them the nearest Evacuation
Center in terms of Calamity. By providing them a suitable evacuation facility based
on the health status of their family. Our system will automatically give a location
closer to the user's present location by filling in all of the essential information from

the user.

"FIRE ALARM SYSTEM
","ABSTRACT

The Fire Alarm System has been developed to provide an optimal solution for
fire spreading. This study focuses only on helping people avoid fire spreading, leading
to minor and significant injuries, and worse is death. Using the System Development
Life Cycle (SDLC) to develop the prototype enhances the development to make the
evaluation of each module easier — it also acts as a guide for the proponents. The
proponents used an offline system named Fire Alarm System in the prototype in sending
the predefined messages that include information of the household such as Name of the
owner, address, and Fire Level. The following electronic components and technologies
were utilized in developing the House to Fire Station communication: Arduino Uno as
the microcontroller, LCD (16 x 2 I2C), Piezo Speaker, Buttons, Breadboard, Jumper
Wires, GSM sim900a, MQ2 Gas Sensor and IR Flame Sensor. The proponents carefully
analyzed all the necessary data gathered from the internet. They surveyed to assess the
quality of the system — to fifty (50) respondents composed of forty-nine (49)
Households, one (1) Fire Marshal of BFP Butuan. The assessment accumulated 4.31
total mean, equivalent to highly acceptable. The device is indeed an ideal solution to
help the prevention of Fire Spreading — enabling the house to communicate and transmit
information towards the Fire Station.

","1.1 The rationale of the study

In these modern times, fire protection and prevention have become one
of the top concerns of people around the globe, according to Trung Luong
(2019), because fire hazards are everywhere, especially indoors where home
appliances and more potential fire hazards like a left out burning candle are
present, that can cause a great deal of damage to human properties or even live
itself. Here in the Philippines, most of the commercial establishments have their
fire systems being installed except for residential buildings both in rural and
urban areas as of yet, according to Chris Schnabel (Rappler, 2016), most
residences 83% of them, have not invested in any fire/security system even
though most people spend most of their time at home with their family and these
areas are most commonly to have a fire outbreak that can quickly spread onto
the nearest households. Therefore, having a fire alarm system in domestic
homes, especially in their kitchens where fire can mostly occur, plays an
important role, which will help prevent and handle fire outbreaks in time the
moment it happens. According to IFSEC Philippines (2021), between 2013 and
2017, the BFP recorded 77,724 fire incidents, 15,545 fire incidents per year, or

42 fire incidents per day. During that time, total estimated property damage
totaled P23.273 billion, or P4.65 billion per year on average. One thousand two
hundred fifty-seven people were killed during the same period, averaging 25]
deaths per year. During the five years, 4,239 people were injured, with an
average of 848 people suffering from fire-related injuries that could have been
avoided. Electrical connections, lighted cigarette butts, and open flame are the

top three causes of fires, according to the BFP.

The Bureau of Fire Protection responded to 16,408 fire incidents
nationwide from January to October 2019, a 14.23 percent increase over the
14,364 recorded during the same period in 2018. Of the total fire incidents in
2019, 7,865 were structural, 7,660 were nonstructural, and 883 were vehicular
fires. Most people aren't that experienced in handling their wirings at home, and
then they refuse to get a professional to take it for them. This kind of scenario
is almost impossible to manage among the masses. Fire detection and alarm
systems (FDAS) are all structured and introduced with the same fundamental
target: to discover a fire; effective alarm and provide information to the
inhabitants; warn and give information to first responders. How these objectives

are satisfied depends on the particular situations and the standard of the area of

the world under consideration.

Having a fire alarm system is one of the primary systems required to be
implemented and installed in every household or establishment in most

countries. The systems that are installed helps alert people of a possible fire
outbreak, give them early warnings, can automatically call the emergency
services and contacts, minimize the time it takes for the fire department to
respond; lower the risks of a false fire alarm; in the event of a fault, it can tell
the exact problem, it also can have reduced fire damage to property according
to Trung Luong (2019). The first fire alarm system ever was invented way back
in 1852 by Dr. William F. Channing and Moses Farmer. The system consisted
of two fire alarm boxes with a telegraphic key and a handle. If a fire were
detected in a home or business, someone would have to reach inside one of the
boxes and crank the handle to send an alert about the fire to a nearby alarm
station. An operator at the station would then take the message and alert a fire
department about it to send help (Life Safety Consultants, 2021). The first
electric fire alarm system was invented almost four decades later in 1890 by
Francis Robbins Upton. He recognized that, in most cases, people wouldn't have
time to stand around and crank a handle inside of a box when a fire started.
Therefore, his electric system eliminated the need for this step. Surprisingly, the
design for his plan wasn't all that popular when it was first introduced, but over
time, people started to realize the need for a more advanced fire alarm system
like this one. Also, based on the online survey conducted by the proponents with
fifty respondents -- tenants in Butuan City's residential zones, 84% responded

that having a fire alarm system is vital and only 16% disagree.

Since these incidents can be prevented early on, the proponents came up

with the idea of developing a fire alarm system suited for residential buildings

"HOUSE RENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
","ABSTRACT

There is an abundance of hotel recommendation Systems available on the
Internet, such as Trivago, Grab Hostel, and Zillow Mobile. Problems arise when finding
a nearby house rental in Butuan City. Implementation of House Rental Management
System has been developed to provide an optimal solution on physically finding rental
houses and paper-based processes on managing rental houses. The system will find the
nearby house rental available, and it will make comparisons with other rental houses
for the tenants to make their choice according to the features requirement. The method
of data collection for collecting user requirements is an interview, and the source of
data for the system's functionalities is primary data. The development of the system
follows the waterfall model methodology. This system's interface is written and
designed using python, client-side scripting using JavaScript. and server-side scripting
using python. The system has three users: administrator, owner, and tenant. The
proponents carefully analyzed all the necessary data gathered from the internet and

conducted a survey to assess the guality of the system — to thirty (30) respondents
composed of ten (10) house rental owner, and twenty (20) house renter. The assessment
accumulated 4.47 total mean, equivalent to highly acceptable. The device ts indeed an
ideal solution to help landlords efficiently manage their information digitally and, in
return, makes it casy for the customers to scarch for houses-to-let since it helps the
landlords advertise their rental houses.

","1.1 Rationale of the Study

In this day, age of Information and Communication Technology (ICT),
computerized booking is expected to provide more convenience to consumers because
they will be able to book at any time, and people may work from any location as long

as they have access to the internet (Mazlan, 2018).

Rental housing is a growing and profitable investment sector that has attracted
many investors from developed and developing nations worldwide. Housing is one of
life's most fundamental needs. It is imperative for economic, social, cultural, and
personal well-being. International human rights legislation recognizes the right to

decent housing. (Nations, 2014).

According to the National Urban Rental Housing Policy (Draft) 2015, issued by
the housing ministry and urban poverty alleviation, rental housing refers to the owner's
property. The tenant pays periodic mutually agreed rent to the owner. As the number of
tenants tends to increase, the management of the rental houses tends to be complicated.
Most of them are paper-based. Some tenants can use this weakness to evade paying the

rent, losing the landlords.

To break out the problem, researchers developed an Android-based named
House Rental System, which aims to solve the common problem of all tenants,
landlords, owners and make the easiest way of locating rent houses. In the past few

years, some researchers were proposed a ""HAYBOL: An Android-Based Apartment
Locator Application (2017)” to provide the needs of the tenants. Unfortunately, specific

solution scenarios were insufficient to meet the needs of all consumers. It is because
not all renters can afford personal computers. Some renters in remote locations were
unable to quickly rent a Personal Computer (PC) or locate a computer store to browse
online to access the site of the aforementioned web-based system. To assist in resolving
the issue, proponents offer a mobile app called ""House Rental Management System.""
It is a mobile-based program that will make it more comfortable for renters, particularly
those who do not have personal computers and rely solely on smartphones and Android
phones. Using the internet, users may quickly download and install the program from
the Google Play store.

As a result, the goal of our initiative is to assist owners/landlords manage their
rental housing firm digitally and without hassle and give access to low-income families,
employees, students, and others. To conveniently locate houses-to-let using technology
rather than physically searching for available rental houses or contacting brokers to
assist them with the process of locating rental residences, which may entail additional
costs. This system will assist landlords in advertising and promoting their house rental

business online in order to obtain as many tenants as possible, which will serve as a

source of income

"Decision Support System: Wedding Planner Application
","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The proponents came up with an idea of developing a DSS: Wedding
Planner Mobile Application that mainly concerns couples who plans to
organize their own wedding event and the store managements of different
wedding ideas who wants to market their businesses. It has a main objective
which is to provide suggestions from application of the different businesses
within Butuan City that provides the needs of the Customer users. The results
are based on the questions and categories that the Customers filled upon
within their respectively own personal taste of planning ideas. This mobile
application is publicly accessed by the Customer users but is not easily be
accessed by Clients or the store managements. They need to ask first to the
proponents and developers of the mobile application to negotiate their
business in order for them to have an access on it. The proponents decided to
develop it as a mobile application and not a web-based system in order for the
users to handily access the Wedding Planner Application through by using
their android phone or android gadgets anywhere and anytime. The
development of the project has a timeline of five months and through using
the Agile Method, the proponents are guided to have a proper management of
development. This helps the proponents to meet the objectives, and to have a

functional and effective Wedding Planner Application.
","Planning a wedding is composed of different areas of duty that would
require more time to deal with it. There are so many things to put into a
wedding, and efficient planning is very important. According to (ACS Distance
Education), a wedding is a very stressful time for most people. So even
though it is a joyous occasion, there is still a lot of stress involved because of
all the organization and planning required. A lot of decisions needs to be
made by the couple and their families to ensure that the went is a momentous

period in their lives.

Decision Support System or DSS is a computer based system that
integrate data sources with modeling and ranking alternatives for decision
management. An example of an existing system from (Dipak, 2015) entitled
PHP Project Online Planner. This project is useful for online customer for
booking and planning their wedding online. The existing systems of wedding
planner are related to the proponent’s projects that provides planning

management or DSS system.
la

That is why it is very important that both of them must communicate on
planning their wedding day. From the cakes, invitations, entourage, reception,
catering, type of wedding, souvenirs, photographer, videographer, hair and
make-up. However some couple choose to rely their wedding preparations

through hiring a wedding planner for a reason that they wanted to rush their
wedding and maybe for a reason that they lack time with the preparation and
planning. But hiring a wedding planner has disadvantages such as time
consuming in terms of communicating with one other. Also it needs a

separate financial budget for the wedding preparation.

In order to conquer this common situation when using manual process,
the proponents came up to a solution by providing an android application
which can help the customers to decide for their preferences. The application
can give customers reliable information and can have a direct and detailed
information on contacting the clients/store management. While the client has
the privilege to exhibit their services in the application and can have direct

customers by applying through admin.

"MOBILE CLASSROOM APP FOR SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL
","The Mobile Classroom App for Senior High School is designed to give
advance and useful way of learning for Senior High School Students at ACLC. It

provides features that are really needed for an effective way of having a Mobile

Classroom Application.

Through this study, the researchers are well aware that there are plenty of
current existing applications that have the same features and are already used
by other schools. Hence, the researchers provided features that are not available
to other existing applications such as Checking of Attendance, Sending Message
to Parents, and Real-Time Chatting to Teachers and Students. With these
features, the researchers believes that it could really be a good help for the users
in order for them to have an easy access in doing their daily activities at school

and for the parents, they could easily monitor the students attendance in school.

To this end, the researchers therefore conclude that the Mobile Classroom

App for Senior High School was able to achieve the objective and it can be used

for future application purposes.
","1.1. Background of the Study

Mobile classroom application is one way of checking what is going on
in classes, with the institution, especially for senior High School. Nowadays,
teachers, parents, and students are looking for an educational application
where they could communicate and connect to one another. There are some
institutions that already uses the application that is already available in the
market which they can use as an educational website for their classes.

ACLC College of Butuan already has an existing e-classroom or virtual
classroom but it was not being implemented due to the following matters; lack
of facilities, lack of information, maintenance, and system architecture wasn't
constructed or built properly. On the other hand, ACLC Senior High School
students and teachers are using Edmodo as an educational website which
serves as an electronic classroom.

The IT researchers proposed the Mobile Classroom Application for
Senior High School because the researchers observed that there is really a
need to come up with another application or the need to enhance the existing
application based on the technology that they are using. This study is going to
be developed to extend the capability of other existing applications specifically

the edmodo and e-classroom. Other existing application caters the features
such as taking quizzes, assignments, uploading and downloading files, and
many more. However, the application that the researchers being proposed will
allow checking the attendance, take picture for their profile picture on their

"FIRE HYDRANT LOCATOR IN BUTUAN CITY
","Fire Hydrant Locator in Butuan City helps the Bureau of Fire Protection
for faster access to locate the nearest hydrants in Butuan City by using the
Application. Also it allows the BFP Admin Officer to Add Hydrants in the
Application, and view the Application. It also has an Admins Security Password
to protect the Application not to add without any concerns from the Admin Officer.
The study aims to to give a fast access to locate the hydrants especially to the
assigned personnel or officers to go to the incidents. Based on the results we
gathered it is guaranteed that this system would help the processing of locating
the hydrants in Butuan City. Therefore, the Fire Hydrant Locator in Butuan City
would be of great help to the Bureau of Fire Protection Officers. It eliminates the
burden of misunderstanding the location of the nearest hydrant in the incidents,
aside from it being time consuming. More importantly, to distinguished and

lessen more risks in every neighbourhood in Butuan City.
","Conventional fire hydrants are generally quite robust and reliable units.
They are relatively simple devices that provides the required reliability. After all,
itis absolutely critical that a fire hydrant be capable of operating as required upon
demand, as an alternative is the potential for major property destruction, and
perhaps serious injury and loss of life (Wasmeyahh M. A. S. Al Azemi, 2013).
This invention relates to a hydrant locator that facilitates the location of a hydrant
by firefighters, particularly in an emergency. The low profile device wraps around
the hydrant cylinder for mounting purposes and a switch in an emergency vehicle
sets off strobe lights on the device upon activation to alert firefighters to the
hydrant location. In fighting fires, time is a crucial factor and precious time is
often wasted searching for a fire hydrant. Ideally, firefighters want to hook up to

the nearest hydrant for purposes of water pressure and running less hose.

This invention comprises a hydrant locator which is low profile and wraps
around the cylinder of the hydrant but does not interfere with discharges from the
hydrant. The locator device comprises a plurality of solar powered strobe lights
that are strapped about the hydrant alternating with solar panels. A locked latch
secures the locator belt of strobe lights and solar panels to the hydrant. A
shatterproof shield is mounted over the strobe lights and solar panels. A receiver
is also mounted within the locator to activate the strobe lights upon receipt of a
remote signal. In use, a remote switch located in an emergency vehicle is

coupled to a transmitter to send a signal to the receiver activating only those
hydrant locators within a given range of approximately 1500 feet. Further the
switch can activate a different colour strobe light to indicate the closeness of the
hydrant. Accordingly, an object of this invention is to provide a new and improved
hydrant locator according to Erik Martin (2004). The use of water, by fire brigades
throughout the world, has its roots set deeply in history. The provision of that
supply has varied dependent on its availability and industrial and social

development according to Stephen Moore (2003).

Research by Catton (1988) and Fowler (2001) has indicated that the
quantity of hydrants installed and the cost of maintenance and testing have led
brigades to consider if they are responsible for too many hydrants. The present
invention is a fire hydrant accessory which provides remote signalling to a central
location, such as a water treatment plant system control and data acquisition
control room, of a sensed parameter at a fire hydrant location. The sensed
parameter can be any one or more of detection of tampering of fire hydrant, water
pressure, temperature of the water flowing through the hydrant, temperature of
the ambient air surrounding the hydrant, etc. Uniquely, the remote signal from a
fire hydrant carries a discrete fire hydrant identification or location indicator which
can be correlated to the specific location or street address dispatch of emergency
response equipment and personnel, to the fire hydrant for repair, etc. (Zoratti,
M.2004). Another invention called fire hydrant locating system includes a fire
hydrant locator that facilitates the location of a hydrant by firefighting, particularly
in an emergency vehicle such as fire engine. The hydrant locator as secured to
the hydrant cylinder has a low profile. The hydrant locating system includes a
transmitter adapter to be located in the emergency vehicle. Upon actuation of a

switch in the transmitter in the emergency a receiver-signal generator in the
hydrant locator will be activated to set off strobe lights to alert firefighters of the

hydrant locator (Bilbery R., et. Al 2007).

The current traditional system of paper documents adopted by Fire
Department had led to the inability of the fire fighters to locate usable and
functioning hydrants in an efficient and effective manner which can jeopardize
any rescue mission. Hence, there is a need to revised the Fire Department
current system and develop a new system that is much more easier, portable
and also time and cost effective in locating the fire hydrants. There are two main
functions of this system which are to locate, view and map fire hydrants and its
related information to assist fire fighters during inspection, maintenances and
emergency cases and to display fire hydrants information to public to facilitates
them in identifying the location and codes of the hydrants that are found to be in
poor condition and assists them to inform Fire Department through

“TemanPiliBomba’” application. (Muhamad Syahir Shadin, 2015).

the beauty of the tourist spots offered by the nature of Caraga.

After gaining up knowledge from the lessons, the game will proceed to
a different type of quizzes which depends on what category they’ve chosen.
For the category Know Caraga, you can play a fill in the blank, for the Trulse,
it is true or false, and for the Caraga’s best it is a multiple-choice type of quiz.
Each quiz completed, the player will be given points that can be redeemable
at a partnered physical store. With this additional feature, the player will not

only benefit from learning but also, they can have freebies using their points.

","According to Salen & Zimmerman (2003), “A game is a system in
which players engage in an artificial conflict, defined by rules that result in a
quantifiable outcome.” The game is known to be a mental and physical
enhancer to every player. It is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for
enjoyment. It generally involves mental or physical stimulation, and often both.
Many games such as strategy, puzzle, and simulation help develop practical
skills, serve as a form of exercise. The game varies nowadays. The famous

ones are the mobile and computer games.

According to the survey conducted by the researchers to the five (5)
professionals, five (5) students of ACLC of Butuan, five (5) civilians, and five
(5) players, a total of twenty (20) populations, games nowadays are inclined to
be entertaining which provides amusement to the players. More often than not
most of it doesn’t provide any educational values to the players— a problem in
which according to our survey that we have conducted that most of the games
they have played gave them bad effects. Aside from that, the proponents also
asked if educational games are dominant in society nowadays, all of them
answered that there are more non-educational games that exist nowadays.
There are some educational games that exist on the internet, but nonetheless,

there are few educational games that promote a place, city or even region.
As a result, the proponents proposed an educational game namely KNOW

CARAGA.

Know CARAGA is an educational game that will help promote the
region CARAGA and at the same time help educates the players about the
history and the beauty of the region. It also focused on how to boost the
players and students' motivation to learn, as well as their interest in the

chapter we review some of the key advances in several areas in BAON Personal
Budget Planner Mobile Application. We also briefly discuss the requirements needed
in designing a successful BAON Personal Budget Planner Mobile Application and
address technical challenges that need to be faced in order to reach the goal in

providing a user-friendly application.
","Planning is the process of thinking about and organizing the activities required
to achieve a desired goal. It involves the Creation and maintenance of a plan, such as
psychological aspects that require conceptual skills. There are even a couple of tests
to measure someone’s capability of planning well. As such, planning is a fundamental
property of intelligent behaviour. A financial plan often includes a budget which
organizes an individual's finances and sometimes includes a series of steps or specific
goals for spending and saving in the future. This plan allocates future income to
various types of expenses, such as rent or utilities, and also reserves some income for

short-term and long-term savings.

In today's mobile world, there should be no question as to whether a business
should have a Mobile Application. Everyone loves the same inspiring world of mobile
application development. Whether it is a business tablet utility application or a

popular mobile game, apps are operating on smart phones and users are running with
smarter and better applications.

The researchers conducted a survey at ACLC College of Butuan and gathered

data from 10 respondents consist of students, instructors and staff during the
nd
st : - i
2semester S.Y 2016-2017. According to the survey, there are respondents said that

they are having a hard time dealing with the manual concept of budgeting such as

paper listing, because it needs to exert effort, it does not provide a reminder or

notification to the respondents, and it is not handy.

A problem identified amongst the following respondents observed is the
difficulty of financial planning in setting their goals.They want to manage their
finances, but didn’t know where to start and they don’t have time to do their own

financial planning because they don’t have tools to guide them.

Therefore, the proponents came up with an idea to develop BAON personal
planner mobile application. The application modernizes the existing concept of
planning, goal setting or budgeting, for it is handy for the users from which they can

input data and receive a notification that would set as a reminder.

"ACLC LIBRARY SYSTEM
","With the new school year, the ACLC College of Butuan Library underwent
many changes including its personal and librarian, with these changes however
the institution is still using an outdated library system where its lacks many

modules that could improve its operations.

The primary objective is this project is to develop a library system that would
replace the existing system being used in the school library, the system would
address the much-needed improvements in library transactions by introducing
many new modules that are still not available with the existing system and

incorporating new technology including barcode and short messaging system.
","4.1 Project Context

“A library is like an island in the middle of a vast sea of ignorance”
(Lemony Snicket, 2007) The library provides the resources for the young
minds to grow, through books magazines or any other learning materials the
library plays an important role in daily teaching, research and learning among
teachers and students. The library is maintained by a staff headed by a
librarian who leads the operations of a library, these operations composed the
acquisition of new learning materials and the listing of these into ledgers; the
cataloging of these materials into lists and the circulation of these materials
for borrowing and returning by the use the of library cards and the filed reports

and statistics of the library’s transactions (Merriam-Webster.com).

The age of computerization AMA Computer Learning Center developed
its own library management system, these integrated library systems are
developed to improve the transactions of the library by providing systematic

cataloguing like students now only need to access the system to search for
learning materials. These systems also improve the systematic recording of
transactions which eliminate the need of traditional library cards. With
interviews made towards the current library staff of ACLC the proponents
observed however that the ACLC staff, instead of the web based library
management system is still using the manual way of cataloging, as one of the
crucial parts of library operations manual cataloging consists of listing new
books arrivals by way of ledgers. The proponents also observed that the staff
is also still using traditional library cards, though still effective, it lacks the
innovation of the current standards today. According to the school librarian the
current library system is rather complex and requires ample training for
effective usage. With this finding, the proponents proceeded to study the
current web based library system of ACLC, with the study, the proponents
observed the current system though still effective for its usage, it lacks the
innovation with today’s current technologies as the system itself is dated, the
current system is also complex in nature requiring ample training to its

effective usage.

With this, the proponents proposed to reengineer the current system of
ACLC College Library into the “ACLC Library System’. The system will
address flaws of the current system like the lapse of security, featuring the
todays innovative technologies like the barcode reader and SMS messaging
for notification. The proposed system will also add functionalities that are

currently lacking in the current system, printing of receipts, improved account
management control and an improved Graphical User Interface for better
usability. The system will also include an online public access catalogue that
can be accessed through the school network helping the users with their
studies by providing a search function for materials that are currently available

in the library.

"ACLC COURSE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
","ACLC Course Recommendation System is implemented to consider
the matter that ACLC of Butuan has an existing system for placement exam
but produces no results. Extra modules and functions are also executed which

are not available in the existing system.

The primary objective of this project is to support the student from
choosing course during the enrollment period. The system has the ability to
recommend courses that are appropriate for the student's skills and
knowledge. Examination is required as part of the whole course
recommendation process. The student’s score serves as a reliable basis that

the system recommends the appropriate courses for them.
","1.1. Project Context

Course selection can be difficult for new upcoming college students
that are appropriate for their proficiency. In most cases we rely on
recommendations from newspapers, people, or the Internet. But these
resources may not be enough as reliance in choosing the appropriate
courses.

Most Colleges and Universities are using an automated course
recommendation system where results are automatically produced. AMA
Computer Learning Center (ACLC) of Butuan has an existing system for
placement exam where freshmen students take before an enrollment.
However, the system produces no decision support making after taking the

exam which is not counselling students what course he/she is qualified.

With the problem identified, the proponents proposed a Course
Recommendation System for ACLC Butuan that will produce decision support
system for course selection that fits the student's proficiency. The placement
exam will be part of the system where the student take the examination and
automatically calculate the student exam result and formulate into course

recommendation using the Stanine Paradigm.
ACLC Course Recommendation System will be a benefit for both
school and students. It helps the school recommend courses to students in an
automated process and helps students select the course suitable for their

"Butuan City Boarding House Locator System
",,"1.1. Introduction

A boardi .
ding house is a house with multiple vacant rooms (frequently a
family home) in which lodgers rent one or more rooms for one or more nights,
ile Sometimes for extended periods of weeks, months, and years. The

commo a,
n parts of the house are maintained, and some services, such as

laundry and cleaning, may be Supplied. They normally provide “room and

board"" that is, at least some meals as well as accommodation. A ""lodging
house,"" also known in the United States as a ""rooming house,"" may or may
not offer meals. Lodgers legally only obtain a license to use their rooms, and
not exclusive possession, so the landlord retains the right of access.
According to the data that we have gathered in the City Hall of Butuan city,
there are 195 registered boarding houses in the city. There are also 25

registered apartments and 5 registered bachelors pad. The rest are registered

real state buildings and house for rent.

There are some studies about boarding house locator or locator

system. The Boarding house locator and monitoring system is a system that

monitors the students and locate boarding houses. It is a system that uses

spiral model as its development model (Reynold G. Bustillo and Benedicto G.

Batistis. 2016). The ATM locator system is a system that can locate ATM

machine from the users current location with the use of Global Positioning
achi
System (GPS). The system is a web-based system that can be access using
1OS mobile phones (Lim Yen Yeng, 2012). The Location Based ATM locator
system (LBALS). The System also can locate ATM machines. It is developed
to aid people searching for ATM's in case of emergency situations and helps
tourists or new comers who are not familiar with the place. The system uses
OpenStreetMap. OpenStreetMap is a growing open source digital map where

ATM booths are map (Rajib Chandra Das, Parijat Prashun Purohit, Tauhidul

Alam, Mahfuzu Chowdhury, 2014).

People who travel away from their homes for study or work are usually
the main occupants of a boarding house. In searching for a boarding house,
people travel from one place to another asking people for the location and the
pricing of each apartment, bachelors pads, and boarding houses. Some
boarding houses, apartments, and bachelors pad are located near flood

prone areas. Some has no fire exits and fire extinguishers, and no Wifi

accessibility and far away from the city.
The proponents develop the “Boarding House Locator System’. The

system can provide an advance way of searching and locating Boarding

Houses, apartments, and Bachelor's Pad. This will lessen the time consumed

in searching, also reduce the hassle of locating boarding houses. It can also
know if the location is near a flood prone area, have a fire exits and fire

extinguishers, have also a Wifi access and also safer to rent.

Payroll is the method of processing various components such as the
daily time record and other factors in creating the exact salary of every
employee in a company. The human resource manages the whole system to
give the exact amount of pay with the use of multiple included data. The
processing of a company’s payroll involves multiple steps that are susceptible
to automation. (D. Kahn, S. Saini, S.E. Kreimer, S.S. Ferguson. 2002.)

Companies must withhold income tax from employee’s earnings like
SSS, Philhealth and other benefits from the employee’s wages. Payroll system
computes employee’s taxes, deductions and salary. It as well uses the datum
to issue paychecks. These systems also typically prepare payroll reports for
management & tax purposes for federal states & local government according
to the book of Understanding Computers. (Jalbuena, 2014.)

The payroll system is one of the useful system that every company or
business needs. This system can minimize the work load involved in
maintaining the employee's overall account. It reduces human efforts and helps

"A SEATING PLAN OPTIMIZATION IN A WEDDING RECEPTION USING

GENETIC ALGORITHM
","ABSTRACT

Genetic algorithms (GA) is an optimization technique for searching very large
spaces that models the role of the genetic material in living organisms. A small
population of individual exemplars can effectively search a large space because
they contain schemata, useful substructures that can be potentially combined to
make fitter individuals. Formai studies of competing schemata show that the best
policy for replicating them is to increase them exponentially according to their
relative fitness. This turns out to be the policy used by genetic algorithms. Fitness is
determined by examining a large number of individual fitness cases. This process
can be very efficient if the fitness cases also evolve by their own GAs. This study
was aimed to focus in creating seating pian in which lot of wedding organizers
considered as one of the difficult task in wedding planning. Genetic Algorithm have
been used in many fields of optimization the researcher believed that it can do much
more in the field of Seating Arrangement and to produce a mode! that is consisted
of optimization technique to produce a nearly optimal seating plan and presented
via 2D simulation. It has been hypothesized that Genetic Algorithm is capable of
processing the inputted name of guests and their relationships through the main
principles of biological evolution. In addition, the researcher faced many challenges
in terms of development and implementation of the algorithm to the software.
However, the result of the study shows that the researcher can produce a nearly
optima! solution through some generations of offspring that have been produced

during optimization.

Keywords: Genetic algorithm, Schemata, Optimization.
","1.1 Background of the Study

Deciding on a wedding seating plan can be one of the most stressful

parts of your wedding planning due to the feedback from guests when the plan

is discussed before the wedding (Leah G, February 20, 2016). Additionally,

according to Jodo Sedoc & Aline Normoyle (2017) regardless of the unusual

aspect of life, the planning of seating arrangement that are based behind the
logic of relationships is exhausting while keeping in mind the serious nature
task of wedding planning and in certain seating characteristics to avoid
sadness, conflict of conversations and hatred towards to the certain person on
the same table. Also, according to Kristin Doherty (2017), they stated that
planning the seating arrangement for a wedding reception is one of the hardest
tasks. Wedding organizers and planners have to make the guests comfortable

of their given seats. When they are placing the guests to their responsive table,

they will realize that it is more complicated. And if there are remaining guests

and nowhere to put them, loss of hope will take over. There will nearly always
be some who are not happy about where they have been seated and who they
have been seated next to. This can be especially tricky when it comes to
deciding who sits on the top table where seating is limited. Guests also tend to

be of the opinion the closer you are to the bride and groom to closer you are

seated to them.
According to Nicholas (2014), he expressed that an appropriate planning
of a wedding is a difficult task, especially when measuring everybody's desires.
Additionally, he also stated that a wedding organizer takes the responsibility to
make the bride and groom satisfied on how much they have paid for the
appropriate organizing of the wedding. A recent survey by YouGov shows that
84% of guests prefer their host to assign them a seat or table at a wedding

reception. Only 13% prefer to be seated anywhere. But planning the seating

arrangements is such a headache that many couples still opt for unassigned

seating. The traditional approach to planning seating arrangements is to write

down guests’ names on scraps of paper and move these around. But this is
time consuming and error prone. Cutting and pasting into a spread sheet is little
better (Fieldwork, 2006). Additionally, according to Kate Siegel (2015), she
stated that open seating can be successful in smaller applications such as
showers and smaller birthday parties. Weddings tend to have higher levels of
people in attendance. Careful planning and thought on the front side of your
event will heip to better insure a seamless experience for your guest, so they

can focus on the bride and groom, the reason they are there in the first place.

In this paper, there are gaps that are seen based on our research the
problem can be soived to find the optimal arrangement of guests at tables using
the Mixed Integer Linear Optimization Techniques. In addition, the problem of
arranging guests around tables can become even more complicated when
tables of different shapes are used. For example, with rectangular tables we
might also need to take account of who sits opposite a guest in addition to their

neighbors on either side.
Thus, instead of Mixed Integer Linear Optimization Techniques the
researchers used Genetic Algorithm to find the optimal seating arrangement of
the guest on a wedding ceremony based on the relationship of each guest to
each other and uses. Simulation to simulate the unexpected events that may

happen during the reception.

"ANDI’S SNACKBREAK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
","Andi's Snackbreak Management System was conceptualized based on
the problems encountered by the management and staff with their Traditional
Processes. The management system covers the major processes mainly:
registration of product, employee profiling, assigning employee, and
assessment of orders. The study aims to turn manual system into a modernized

also review all transaction logs Also, the cashier can follow up and check the

customer’s order and lastly, the employee can monitor and check their pay

income daily and also access their personal information.
","1.1 Introduction

A system and appertaining methods are provided that make it possible
to order pizza and other products using an instant messaging or other signaling
mechanisms such as cellular phones and two-way pagers, using a tokenized
representation of the order elements (Kargman, 2011). The system and method
provide for issuing an employee an identifier (Stoutenburg, 1999). Production
planning has among its objectives the determination of inventory levels. In this
paper, we are primarily concerned with inventories that are involved in the
industrial production, namely inventories of raw materials, purchased and
manufactured parts, subassemblies, assemblies, and finished products (Hax,
1979). A computer system and method is used for processing bills for a vast
number of customers of a plurality of node systems within a larger system, with
each customer bill having a particular billing cycle, which comprises of a
memory for storing a plurality of customer bill records containing raw data to be

processed to generate a customer bill (Cohen, 2002). A portable electronic
device includes a queuing system (Lee, 2014).

Based on the study of Willam Doan (2003), a method and system for entering
based sales management system of a

an order into an onsite computer-

restaurant.
A communication link is established between an offsite employee and an order-

placing talk box at the restaurant. The communication link is utilized for two-

way voice communication so that a food order can be taken from a customer

located at the restaurant by the offsite employee. A data communication link is
utilized by the offsite employee to enter the order into the onsite computer-
based sales management system which facilitates food preparation, fee
collection, and the recording of sales. Preferably, the offsite employee utilizes
a personal computer to accomplish the stated functions, the communication
links are provided via the Internet, and the customer is located within a vehicle

adjacent the restaurant when placing his/her order.

An objective of the present invention is to provide a method and system
for routing food orders over a computer network to enable customers to place
food orders such as pizza orders electronically, in a customer centric
environment that reflects their needs and preferences, and provides the
convenience they have come to expect from any shopping experience (Vitek,
2003). Another objective of the present invention is to provide a method and
system for routing food orders over a computer network wherein the invention

works with a point-of-sale systems such as new proposed point-of-sale systems
(NGSS) and legacy point-of-sale systems (NSC, Breakaway, other) and

wherein the experience of the consumer will be consistent no matter what

technology exists at a food store (Wagner, 2003).

expression pattern matching and optical character recognition. This innovation
helps the librarian to share the information regarding books. The system lets
you upload the file image of back-of-the-book indexes that will be extracted
with the use of optical character recognition software called Python Tesseract
OCR Engine. This OCR engine will let you extract the text from the file image
and save into the database. This system also has a search feature that has a
pattern matching that matches the books who has a related topics. The
Proponents used the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Agile

system since there can be many changes throughout the development stage
of the system. When the survey was released and finished the results were
tabulated and found out that the developed system received positive
feedbacks from the respondents of the study. The developed system was
highly accepted and efficient to the users based on the total mean of 3.27
gathered from the ISO-1926-1 Survey Questionnaire. The proponents
conclude that the Book Indexing with Regular Expression Pattern Matching
using Optical Scanner will have a wide variety of knowledge to be spread and
will make the searching for books and related books be more efficient, reliable
and more advanced compared to the current manual procedures.

Keywords: Book Indexing, OCR, Regular Expression, PyTesseract, Back-of-
the-Book Index
","4.1 Rationale of the Study

Book indexing has always been a method in making a list of discussed

topics in a book. According to Hesham (2016), a book index is simply a key to
locating information found in a book. It is a method to create indexes to
provide access to detailed contents of books. Library has a collection of
documents that undergo a procedure for cataloging the bibliographic records
composed of all the basic data within a book which are then selected to be
indexed and can serve as keywords to be accessed later on Pokorny (2018).
Book indexing is a pathway that guides the person searching for related
books. According to the CSU Librarian Assistant M.G. Reyes, the importance
of the book indexing is to serve as a primary source of information on certain
topics that the researchers needs.

Two types of techniques can be used for automated book indexing: (a)
Standalone or Dedicated tools, is one of the techniques that is usually applied
for back-of-the-book indexes which permits the indexers to work from page-
numbered galleys; and (b) automated indexing software which is a tool that

now paired with most word-processing software. The outcomes are a list of

words and phrases that are applicable in the early stages of making an index.

With the use of OCR, we can easily scan the back-of-the-book indexes.
It is less time-consuming and it will make the process of producing digitalized

book index more efficient. Optical character recognition/reader (OCR) is a
process of conversion of images from scanned any type of printed documents

into a machine-coded text.

Regular Expression (RegEx) is a concept of string pattern searching
that enable to find a sequence of character in a string. As stated by Friedl
(2006), in terms of manipulating string and bunch of data, regular expression
is one of the powerful tool used. By using Regex, string pattern and matching
became easily and handy for any purposes. By using RegEx, we can
manipulate a bunch of data that remove or lessen the load on the computer's

processor.

plant and it will serve as the detector.

Keywords: Convolutional Neural Network, Image Processing, Tensorflow
","Rice is the staple food of Asia and part of the Pacific. Over 90 percent of
the world’s rice is produced and consumed in the Asia-Pacific Region.
According to the Department of Agriculture Caraga Regional Office they can
detect diseased rice plant and pest infestation in rice plant by their application.
After they detected the possible rice field that have the most infested rice plant,
they will coordinate to the owner of the rice field and they will tell if how many
percentage of the rice field has being infested but according to the farmer Mr.
Reynaldo B. Roperos, resident in Barangay Bading, said that they don’t have

any connection with the Department of Agriculture, they only do things by their
own and they could only know if the rice plant is infested by a pest is only by
touching the leaves and by checking manually with their eyes.

A pest infestation on rice plant has always resulting in enormous anxiety
on farmers because of the damaged has been cost on their rice plants. For the
past few years’ farmers have experience a difficulty on identifying on what
possible disease and pest the rice plant may have. Nowadays, they manually
monitor the rice plant through picking up some example and uses their hands
to identify the possible disease and pest that attacks on it.

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nation (UN) that
the common problem encountered by rice farmers were high cost of inputs,
low price of palay, lack of capital, labour problem, lack of postharvest, facilities,
irrigation system and the most common problem when the different pest’s are

destroying the production of rice during wet season, it causes leaf discoloration,

stunted growth, reduced tiller numbers and sterile or partly filled grains, infected
leaves turn greyish green and roll up. As the disease progresses, leaves turn
yellow to straw-colored and wilt, leading whole seedlings to dry up and die, and
It attacks different parts of the plant: the collar, which can ultimately kill the
entire leaf blade; the stem, which turns blackish and breaks easily (node blast);
the neck of the panicle, where the infected part is girdled by a greyish brown
lesion, or when severe, causes the panicles to fall over; or on the branches of
the panicles which exhibit brown lesions when infected(AGRIS et al., 2009).

near in coastal areas was highly acceptable based on the total mean obtained
of 4.7. The robot was indeed useful to the residents who live in the coastal
areas because it helps them to collect the small piece of floating garbage to
help them in cleaning and preserve the environment. This eliminates the
manual way of collecting the garbage. It was important to be more safety and
maintain the cleanliness of the envronment.

Keywords: Collect, Detect, Manual, Automatic, Dump.
","1.1 Rationale of the Study

Marine litter is human created waste that has deliberately or
accidentally been released in waterway. Floating garbage tends to
accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground,
when it is also Known as beach litter or tide wrack. Waste collection is the
collection of solid waste from point of production to the point of treatment or
disposal. Numerous countries worldwide are currently facing major problems
related to waste collection, particularly in water bodies, due to the large
amount of waste generated daily by the population. Technology plays a
significant role in tackling these issues, for instance, through the development

of more effective tools to gather and collect garbage.

Object Detection is a computer technology related to computer vision
and image processing that detects and define semantic object instances from
digital image and videos, and itis also used for raspberry pi projects, Robert
Oliver et.al (2017). Microcontrollers are used in automatic controlled products
and other embedded system, it is economical to digitally control even more
device processes. In the context of IOT (Internet of things), microcontrollers
are economical and popular means of data collection, sensing and actuating

the physical world as edge device.
According to Alvahab (2019) Object detection is now becoming

apparent in industries that involve detecting instances of objects from a

particular class in an image like small piece of garbage that can be performed
by detecting; it processes the image that is seen by the camera, Yali Amit
and Pedro Felzenszwalb (2016). The threat of waste to the environment,

health and safety is huge. Pollution runs into rivers and seeps into ground
water. Flooding is caused by garbage clogging drains, and the atmosphere

can be poisoned by the toxic discharge from trash.

Water pollution is one of the serious ecological threats we face today,
and the garbage is the major problem not only in the cities but also in the
water bodies Melissa, Denchak (2018). It can affect our health, marine
species and can ruin our environment. Collecting small piece of garbage on
the water surface is hard to detect due to its size especially if the floating
garbage had spread to the different direction on water surface. It is also
uncommon for people to pay attention in picking up small pieces of garbage
floating on the water surface. The widely used garbage collecting machine is

controlled manually and the problem on it is cannot be used without an

operator.
In regard of this, Aquabot: An Aquatic Microcontroller Based Floating
Garbage Collector using Object Detection Technology aims to manage

floating garbage in water way. It can detect and collect floating garbage in the

water surface. Floating garbage can be detected using object detection with

the help of OpenCV and Tersorflow. Through the use of GPS the robot can

easily navigate the surface water. It can be automatically or remotely

controlled through the used web application. Using the robot it can minimize

the manpower in cleaning the water surface.

"A SYSTEM FOR GROUND SHAKING DETECTION & EMBEDMENT OF
DYNAMIC SAFETY MECHANISM IN BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURES
","Ground shaking is one of the effects of an ea

the vibration of the ground during an earthquake whieh ie an Gone sbes
phenomenon. The Philippines is vulnerable to calamities because it is part of
the pacific ring of fire and most of our resources for calamity preparation are
not much on earthquake events. The shaking and moving of the ground from
earthquakes are not predictable, but it can be measured. Seismic activity, which
is the shaking of the ground, is measured by seismographs. The proposed work
is to design a system that can detect ground shaking and provide a dynamic
safety mechanism for building infrastructures. The system will estimate the local
seismic intensity of the ground shaking at the particular location of the

the ADXL335 three-axis accelerometer. This sensor can measure the static
acceleration of gravity in tilt-sensing applications, as well as dynamic
acceleration resulting from motion, shock, or vibration and use Arduino UNO as
its main controller. It is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-
use hardware and software and applies the 3-dimensional vector formula to get
the seismograph reading of the shaking. It also applies the Richter scale
formula to calculate the approximate magnitude. The system provides an alarm
signal and safety mechanisms to a building like automatically opening doors
and activating guiding lights. Those dynamic safety mechanisms will trigger the
approximated threshold. Optimistically, the system should help to reduce the
number of injuries and casualties due to its capabilities during a ground-shaking
situation.

","1.1 Rationale of the Study

The geographical location of the Philippines in the Pacific makes the
country highly susceptible to natural hazards Such as earthquakes. The country
is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, “an area encircling the Pacific Ocean where
earthquakes and volcanic activity result from the movements of tectonic plates.”
(Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2008). Because man has no control

over earthquakes, they must be considered it as unavoidable events
(International Civil Defense Organization [ICDO}, n.d.). According to the book,
“Living on an Active Earth: Perspectives on Earthquake Science” that the
preparation and rapid emergency response are therefore the bulwarks of a
good seismic defense (National Research Council, 2003).
Butuan City Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council (BCDRRMC)
Stated that most of the resources of the DRRM is focused on mitigating flooding
but not much on earthquake preparedness. At present, the preparedness plan
initiated for earthquake events is training for Basic Life Support and Fire Drill.
The government's response to disaster is focused on mostly emergency relief
measures. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology
(PHIVOLCS) mandates services for a warning, disaster preparedness, and
mitigation, but they only provide a wide scale of information. So, in that matter,
having the idea of adding technical measures, the proponents realize how

beneficial a system to a building that can detect an approximate level of ground

shaking and can provide dynamic safety mechanisms.
By considering the Philippines ' geographical location and by conducting
research and studies in some residents in Butuan City, the proponents intend
to develop a system which can be used and beneficial to buildings and houses
in Butuan, which lead them to create a System for Ground Shaking Detection

& Embedment of Dynamic Safety Mechanism in Building Infrastructures.

"A WEB BASED ACCESS PORTAL TO FACILITATE FUND SOURCING
AND TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT FOR SCHOLARS AND SPONSORS
","Web Based Access Portal to Facilitate Fund Sourcing and Transaction
Management for Scholars and Sponsor has been developed to provide
scholarship for the students who are not capable in paying tuition fees or not
well enough. Also to guide potential sponsors where they can share their
blessings by supporting a student and choosing for scholarship to support.
The system is able to generate code name of the student which will be
presented to the sponsor instead of their full name. It also has four users
which is the administrator, scholar in-charge, funds in-charge and sponsor.
The study used System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as a method which
applied while developing the system. The design involves Entity Relationship
Diagram (ERD) and Data Flow Diagram (DFD) to show the logical flow for the
system. For the implementation, Apache is used as a web server, MySQL for
database, PHP Laravel as a scripting language and Google Chrome as a
browser. The proponents conducted survey for the software quality of the
system to the scholar coordinator and possible sponsors and was acceptable
based on the total mean obtained of 3.89. The system evaluation was based
from real users and the system is able to perform the task correctly.

","1.1 Rationale of the Study
After more than two decades, Somalia children lost the chance for formal
education. This country is one of the world’s lowest enrolment rates that only
30 percent of student could be able to go to school. The highest rate of
poverty in community of Somalia makes it hard for parents to afford their
children studies or even on their school fees. That is the main reason why
they give up not sending their children to school. This data is based on the

United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) report.

According to ABS-CBN news report that there are 3.8 million of Filipinos
are out of school youth (OSCYs), 87.3 percent were 16 to 24 years old, 7.7
percent were 12 to 15 years old, and 5.0 percent were 6 to 11 years old.
Survey result shows that having a high cost of education and financial
concern is the main reason of dropping out or not attending in college. The
data was based according to a 2016 survey by Philippine Statistic Authority
(PSA).

Since college is the most expensive it’s ever been. A large number of
students don’t complete or finish their studies due to lack of funds and high
education cost (Patel and McWhirter, 2019). Considering the difficulties in
college, there are still students who wants to pursue their studies. Even if they
rely on loans to get them through continue schooling to pay their tuition

(Hoffower et al., 2019).
Scholarship program is the possible answer of those diligent students
and committed to their study. It is about money and sponsoring related to
guide the needy students. It gives the chance to a various individuals to gain

education (Schenberg et al., 2002).

","1.1 Rationale of the Study
Mobile games have been developed to be probably the largest
area within the software development industry (Hatridge, 2016). Extensive
use of mobile phones will provide the advantage of developing games
running on an android device. History provides a sense of context to our
lives and helps us to understand the way things might approach the future.
The study of history is sometimes classified as part of the humanities and
at other times as part of the social sciences. Playing mobile games
throughout learning of history can encourage people to play android games
and may give an interest in the software development industry.

Mobile games are emerging with an enormously competitive
industry and many video games are produced daily in the previous two
years (Su, 2016). Android applications are one of the most significant
innovations in the mobile industry and in the year 2016, 90% of Google Play
income originated from games (Hindy, 2017). Historical games, like many
historical movies, are brimming with precision, primarily to improve the story

in the medium and make it additionally engaging (Mclaughlin, 2015).
Incorporating history into a game requires sufficient time to research at least
some of the key facts straight. A mobile game that is blended in with history

and entertainment has additionally carried new enthusiasm to retro games

(D'Argenio, 2019).
In the study of history, effective Strategies are lacking for students
to improve their learning process in history, some students may find the
study of history not interesting (Tok, 2016). They would rather hold their
mobile phones and play video games than reading books and gain some
knowledge of history. Usually in video games, the goal is to entertain people
and not prioritize giving facts about the player's history. In mobile games,
players spend long hours playing games which will result in much less time
spent studying their lessons.
A history-based game will be a bridge for the players to know
about history of a place while playing. Playing history-based games on
mobile devices might change the player’s perspective in learning about

history. The study is not only to entertain but also it helps the users to gain

knowledge about the story of Rajah Qi-ling during his era.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Mobile
Classroom App for Senior High School is designed to give
advance and y j
Seful way of learning for Senior High School Students at ACLC. It

rovides fea
p tures that are really needed for an effective way of having a Mobile
Classroom Application.

Through this Study, the researchers are well aware that there are plenty of
current existing applications that have the same features and are already used
by other schools. Hence, the researchers provided features that are not available
to other existing applications such as Checking of Attendance, Sending Message
to Parents, and Real-Time Chatting to Teachers and Students. With these
features, the researchers believes that it could really be a good help for the users
in order for them to have an €asy access in doing their daily activities at school

and for the parents, they could easily monitor the students attendance in school.

To this end, the researchers therefore conclude that the Mobile Classroom

App for Senior High School was able to achieve the objective and it can be used

","1.1 Background of the Study

Mobile Classroom application is one way of checking what is going on
in classes, with the institution, specially for senior High School. Nowadays,
teachers, Parents, and students are looking for an educational application
where they could communicate and connect to one another. There are some
institutions that already uses the application that is already available in the
market which they can use as an educational website for their classes.

ACLC College of Butuan already has an existing e-classroom or virtual
classroom but it was not being implemented due to the following matters; lack
of facilities, lack of information, maintenance, and system architecture wasn’t
constructed or built properly. On the other hand, ACLC Senior High School
students and teachers are using Edmodo as an educational website which
serves as an electronic classroom.

The IT researchers proposed the Mobile Classroom Application for
Senior High School because the researchers observed that there is really a
need to come up with another application or the need to enhance the existing
application based on the technology that they are using. This study is going to
be developed to extend the capability of other existing applications specifically

the edmodo and e-classroom. Other existing application caters the features
2

such as taking quizzes, assignments, uploading and downloading files, and
many more. However, the application that the researchers being proposed will
allow checking the attendance, take picture for their profile picture on their

account, and send SMS to parent to inform them once their child is absent in

","1.1 INTRODUCTION

According to Jennifer Rowley (2005), today’s computerized world,
administrative offices also tend to become paperless offices and with no more
‘piles of files’ scenario. This advancement aids the governing bodies in
disposal of the issues within a reasonable time frame with evasion of
Stationery use. File Tracking System is a step in the direction of realizing the
concept of paperless office. The solution is a simulation of physical files into
the electronic form. This enables fast retrieval and makes file movement & file
tracking painless. Longevity of the electronic form solves the problem of

material loss.

In this case, the proponents chose Bureau of Internal Revenue ( BIR)
District office as the setting where we could conduct our study and apply our
system in accordance to its benefits. The proponents had observed that, in
the Bureau of Internal Revenue District office, many taxpayers spent longer
time just to finish processing the requirements needed for their businesses.
The proponents observed that a day is not enough to finish the requirement

that’s why people are constrained just to finish their requirements.
The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) File Tracking System is a web
application that manages all the files’ movement at any time for one
desk/room to another one and helps in managing the flow of files efficiently.
Any desk/room can receive and send request and decisions at any time. The
system follows a procedure of file unique numbering, file status monitoring,
file movement tracking and etc. It also has a very powerful search from to
locate a file and analysed the history of movement of that file. The proposed

system is also an android application for taxpayers viewing purposes.

The proponents proposed Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) File
Tracking System covers different business transaction examples like
registering of business, taxpayer identification, taxpayer and business taxable
and its process. The proposed system concentrates only to track the papers’
movement. Instead of waiting in the office just to process their papers, they
can leave their papers and continue the transaction without waiting. The
taxpayers can update their papers by viewing using an android application to
avoid queuing just to ask the updates of their papers. Bureau of Internal
Revenue file tracking system it is a system made to ease the waiting process
to clients and to avoid the office to become always crowded. To avoid paper
lost and easy to search data, the proponents made this system which primary
function is to track papers, find out the next step of the papers’ progress, and

percentage of completion.

","4.1. Introduction

Technological change and innovation are acknowledged almost
universally as determinants of globalization (Narula, R. (2014)). The
number of people using android device is increasing since 2016. Games
are the biggest contributor to Google Play’s revenue. History is the
backbone of every city, a memory that needs to be preserved. In this
millennial era, combining history with technological advancement is
possible. This study will promote the City of Butuan using an android-
based mobile game entitled, “The Legend of Butuan: The Masao Warrior.”

2016 recap: 90% of Google Play’s revenue came from games (Hindy,
J. (2017)). The advent of these games had made its way to educational
institution. The researchers used mobile games in a variety of learning
environments to synthesize current literature about the impact of the use
of mobile games on student achievement and attitudes towards learning
(Koutromanos, G., & Avraamidou, L. (2014)). Learning by playing concept
is valid for history museums and cultural centers on the terms of Cultural
Heritage (Perez-Valle A., et al (2014, November)). It is expected that
game-play will trigger a desire to learn more about ancient history and to

make archaeological visits more effective and exciting (Ardito, C., et al.

(2007, April)).
Butuan City does not use all the effective media yet, to promote the
vicinity. People plan for and worry about the future, making them too busy
to neither worry about what has been nor visit and roam Butuan City in
order to further study its history. Studying history in this generation ends
up boring and distaste of the topic that they think it is uninteresting. They
prefer playing games rather than learning about history. These games

usually do not prioritize valuable lessons in regards to history integration.

No matter how busy a person gets, he would find a way to unwind and
cool things up in an easiest manner possible. Using the advanced
technology, proponents developed an android mobile game that involves
real-life historical event mixed with fictional elements to spice things up. It
featured the City of Butuan with its history and landmarks. This mobile
game will make it possible for them to be entertained and make Butuan
City accessible in a way. While players are enjoying, they would learn

about the historical phenomenon of the city, as well. This will then serve as

a creative promotional resource for the City of Butuan.

"Decision Support System: Wedding Planner Application
","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The proponents came up with an idea of developing a DSS: Wedding
Planner Mobile Application that mainly concerns couples who plans to
organize their own wedding event and the store managements of different
wedding ideas who wants to market their businesses. It has a main objective
which is to provide suggestions from application of the different businesses
within Butuan City that provides the needs of the Customer users. The results
are based on the questions and categories that the Customers filled upon
within their respectively own personal taste of planning ideas. This mobile
application is publicly accessed by the Customer users but is not easily be
accessed by Clients or the store managements. They need to ask first to the
proponents and developers of the mobile application to negotiate their
business in order for them to have an access on it. The proponents decided to
develop it as a mobile application and not a web-based system in order for the
users to handily access the Wedding Planner Application through by using
their android phone or android gadgets anywhere and anytime. The
development of the project has a timeline of five months and through using
the Agile Method, the proponents are guided to have a proper management of
development. This helps the proponents to meet the objectives, and to have a

functional and effective Wedding Planner Application.
","Planning a wedding is composed of different areas of duty that would
require more time to deal with it. There are so many things to put into a
wedding, and efficient planning is very important. According to (ACS Distance
Education), a wedding is a very stressful time for most people. So even
though it is a joyous occasion, there is still a lot of stress involved because of
all the organization and planning required. A lot of decisions needs to be
made by the couple and their families to ensure that the went is a momentous

period in their lives.

Decision Support System or DSS is a computer based system that
integrate data sources with modeling and ranking alternatives for decision
management. An example of an existing system from (Dipak, 2015) entitled
PHP Project Online Planner. This project is useful for online customer for
booking and planning their wedding online. The existing systems of wedding

planner are related to the proponent’s projects that provides planning

management or DSS system.

That is why it is very important that both of them must communicate on
planning their wedding day. From the cakes, invitations, entourage, reception,
Catering, type of wedding, souvenirs, photographer, videographer, hair and

make-up. However some couple choose to rely their wedding preparations

through hiring a wedding planner for a reason that they wanted to rush their
wedding and maybe for a reason that they lack time with the preparation and
planning. But hiring a wedding planner has disadvantages such as time
consuming in terms of communicating with one other. Also it needs a

separate financial budget for the wedding preparation.

In order to conquer this common situation when using manual process,
the proponents came up to a solution by providing an android application
which can help the customers to decide for their preferences. The application
can give customers reliable information and can have a direct and detailed
information on contacting the clients/store management. While the client has

the privilege to exhibit their services in the application and can have direct

Customers by applying through admin.

"ANDI’S SNACKBREAK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
","Andi’s Snackbreak Management System was conceptualized based on
the problems encountered by the management and staff with their Traditional
Processes. The management system covers the major processes mainly:
registration of product, employee profiling, assigning employee, and
assessment of orders. The study aims to turn manual system into a modernized

one. It makes the task easier and eliminates the use of manual processing.

Based on the gathered result, the system is indeed helpful in processing
the transactions. The result was weighted through the usability test scale of the
system and the scoring was based on the mathematical standard of system
usability test scale. The proponents conclude that through the use of the
proposed Management System, the owner, who will become the admin, can
manually add, collect and retrieve products and employee information, and can
also review all transaction logs Also, the cashier can follow up and check the
customer’s order and lastly, the employee can monitor and check their pay

income daily and also access their personal information.

","4.1 Introduction

A system and appertaining methods are provided that make it possible
to order pizza and other products using an instant messaging or other signaling
mechanisms such as cellular phones and two-way pagers, using a tokenized
representation of the order elements (Kargman, 2011). The system and method
provide for issuing an employee an identifier (Stoutenburg, 1999). Production
planning has among its objectives the determination of inventory levels. In this
paper, we are primarily concerned with inventories that are involved in the
industrial production, namely inventories of raw materials, purchased and
manufactured parts, subassemblies, assemblies, and finished products (Hax,
1979). A computer system and method is used for processing bills for a vast
number of customers of a plurality of node systems within a larger system, with
each customer bill having a particular billing cycle, which comprises of a
memory for storing a plurality of customer bill records containing raw data to be

processed to generate a customer bill (Cohen, 2002). A portable electronic

device includes a queuing system (Lee, 2014),

Based on the study of Willam Doan (2003), a method and system for entering

an order into an onsite computer-based sales management system of a

restaurant.
A communication link is established between an offsite employee and an order-
placing talk box at the restaurant. The communication link is utilized for two-
way voice communication so that a food order can be taken from a customer
located at the restaurant by the offsite employee. A data communication link is
utilized by the offsite employee to enter the order into the onsite computer-
based sales management system which facilitates food preparation, fee
collection, and the recording of sales. Preferably, the offsite employee utilizes
a personal computer to accomplish the stated functions, the communication
links are provided via the Internet, and the customer is located within a vehicle

adjacent the restaurant when placing his/her order.

An objective of the present invention is to provide a method and system
for routing food orders over a computer network to enable customers to place
food orders such as pizza orders electronically, in a customer centric
environment that reflects their needs and preferences, and provides the
convenience they have come to expect from any shopping experience (Vitek,
2003). Another objective of the present invention is to provide a method and
system for routing food orders over a computer network wherein the invention
works with a point-of-sale systems such as new proposed point-of-sale systems
(NGSS) and legacy point-of-sale systems (NSC, Breakaway, other) and

wherein the experience of the consumer will be consistent no matter what

technology exists at a food store (Wagner, 2003).

"ACLC DEPARTMENTAL EXAMINATION SCHEDULING SYSTEM
","The proposed ACLC Departmental Scheduling System was created
and designed to supply the needs of the client. The researchers gathered all
the data in order to develop a system which created schedules for the users
freed from hassle going to school just to look for their exam schedules.
Further saying this system is useful for the scheduler and also for the students
to determine their respected schedules. For the instructors, with their busy

schedules, they can save time looking for their exam schedule that they are
going to proctor.

The researchers aim to create an electronic system for departmental
examinations in ACLC Departmental Examination Scheduling System (ADES)
ACLC Butuan while the scheduler stands as an admin and the one who
creates the entire schedule for the departmental examination. The HR can
only view the schedule and indicate the time for the proctors. The instructor

and student can only view their schedule through the mobile app.

The researcher successfully created the system which really helps not

just for the students but also for the scheduler to view their exam schedules.

The researchers, therefore, concluded based on the testing phase that
on the student’s side, they fount out that the application is appropriate and
accessible to the students. On the other hand, teachers or instructors also

appreciated the function of the application, especially the viewing of the exam

schedules.
","In a general educational timetabling problem, a set of events courses
and exams are assigned into a certain number of timeslots (time periods)
subject to a set of constraints, which often makes the problem very difficult to
solve in real-world circumstances. There are large numbers of commercial
software packages available to assist with the timetabling problem. However,
due to the variety of characteristic procedure and complexity of each
university in the scheduling process make the study in this research area still
interesting. In order to solve the best solution for this timetabling problem, a

wide research area has been studied in various complexity problems with

different algorithm solution

Nowadays, some of the institutions lacks the proponents to ease or
to handle things, and since technology is improving, as IT developers the role
is to help some of those institutions that have in need of an upgrade, unlike

the traditional method that has been used by the scheduler for a long time.

The researchers aim to create an electronic system for
departmental examinations in ACLC Departmental Examination Scheduling
System (ADES) ACLC Butuan. The system would lessen the workload on the
scheduler’s side, through the help of the proposed system, conflicts on
schedules will be minimized and be organized, instead of using the manual
way of generating schedules, the proposed system will provide easier tabling.
And if the (ADES) ACLC Departmental Examination Scheduling System is

implemented it will be a system unlike before from the old methods that the
scheduler have been using. For this system enables users to save time and

effort and do other tasks in their work.
1.2 Project Context

The researchers conducted an interview on how the scheduler makes
or plot the examination schedules. And as we have seen and experienced,

the hassle and the time spent in making schedules is not easy.

It takes days to complete the departmental examination schedules and
provides also a schedule for the HR (Human Resources) so the researchers
decided to provide a system that would create departmental schedules and
have the data retrieved from the Enrolment system (data dependent)
specifically only to the subjects offered on the active semester, which will
minimize the timeline in plotting the schedules for the scheduler’s part. At the

same time, it is easy for the HR to see or to check the proctor’s hours in the
exams and the student, as well as the instructor, would be able to see the

schedule on the mobile app, instead of using manual way of generating

schedules, the proposed system will provide easier tabling.

suspect and the crime committed (Sodusta B., Joint USA Philippines
Investigation Division, Subic Bay Philippines, 2016). The police station is a
setting that would appear to favors neither offender nor victim (LaPrairie,
C., 1995). Web application is defined as a dynamic HTTP-based application
whose interactions are amenable to machine processing (Hadley, M. et.al.
2006). Mobile application is defined as a software application, a wireless
service or a mobile service that can be either pushed to users’ handheld
wireless devices or downloaded and installed, over the air (Mahmoud, Q.
et.al.). Nowadays, mobile and web applications exceeds than desktop
application in the market for emergency use (Charland, A., et.al, 2011). That
is why the researchers came up with the study of development and
evaluation of android and web-based application for police station crime
report.
There are many ways of reporting crimes that was implemented
such as emergency telephone number 911 system from the example places
like in USA and Davao City, Philippines (Tamayo, A., 2016). In the

Philippines, there is also an emergency telephone number system which is
117 (Sanidad-Leones, C. 2006). In Butuan City, Philippines, there is also a
crime reporting system that focuses in SMS medium transmission (Pacot,
M., et. al., 2015). Currently, there are other prevailing mobile and web
applications were capable of catering crime reporting to provide the said
service to the public and also determining approximate location of the crime
incident through GPS (Caranzo, K. A., et. al., 2016). Also, an application
that has a combined functionalities such as health, social services, urban
planning and building, fire brigade, police, armed forces, public works, and
traffic safety (ICARUS, 2015). ICARUS uses latest mapping technology
capable of tracking crime incidents to directly respond to specific need as

identified and a quick response team.

There are some issues among existing applications that is quite
important about crime related situations that they did not include. One of
this is the application could not be useful for respective people pertaining to
report as a witness to wanted criminals or suspects that needs to be
imprisoned to bring forth justice. Also, finding individuals who went missing
a couple of months/years ago. But broadcasting media is not enough way
to let the public familiarize the faces of those. There is a need of an
alternative to let the public not just to be vigilant of the environment about

crime but also to work together to apprehend suspects, search and seizure

missing individuals in order to retain safety, peace and order of the public.
The proposed study of the researchers is intended to help the
public to deliver a clear communication in reporting a crime incident to the
police department could clearly identify and understand the situation. By
using GPS as a tool to be used in mapping visualization of crime reports,
then public could easily determine what, when, where, who, why and how
the crime incident occur. Police department officers accomplish problem-
solving goals by developing strong linkages with residents, for-profit firms,
non-profit agencies, and corollary government units to provide a variety of
services to the community (Brown et.al, 2001). This made the study be in

concern on how to apprehend, search and seizure of criminal suspects and

missing persons. This could be made possible by providing some sort of

details entailing their specific identity mainly from the police departments.

These mentioned functionalities proves this study's gap from all other

existing mobile or web applications currently today.

"MAHAY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ENROLLMENT SYSTEM
","Mahay Elementary School Enrollment System was conceptualized
based on the ideas, problems encountered by the school staff with their
Enrollment Processes. The enrollment system covers the major processes
mainly: registration of student and employee profiling, assigning of teachers,
sectioning, assessment of fees and grading system. The study aims to turn
manual system into a computerized one. [t makes the task easier and

eliminates the use of manual processing.

Based on the result we gathered, the system is indeed helpful in
processing the transactions. The result was weighted through the usability
test scale of the system and the scoring was based on the mathematical
Standard of system usability test scale. The proponents conclude that through
the use of the proposed Enrollment System, the information and
communication technology-In charge, who will become the Admin, who
manually add, collects and retrieve student’s information, Advisers who list the
enrollees and grade students, principal who monitors the students information
and general parent-teacher association treasurer who manually do the

assessment of fees may take their advantages in order to meet their work

faster and effective.

","1.1 Introduction

According to (llagan, Lexter 2010), “Enrollment is a process of entering
and verifying data of the student register on a particular school. Different
interrelated processes build up enrollment procedures called Enrollment
System. Enrollment System are used particularly in recording and retrieving
student’s information. Tracking student's information is also one feature of
Enrollment System. Verifying payments was also added to upgrade or browse

student's billings’.

The Enrollment System is a good example of a computer generated
process. This can lessen the workload and provides accurate information
needed by the school. As a result, it will benefit not only the student but also
the administration as a whole. In the case of Mahay Elementary School,
they’re manually conducting enrollment processes where they are more
occupied with people and paper works which may lead to difficulty in keeping

data in a secured way.

In order to promote an enhanced way of conducting an Enrollment, Mahay
Elementary School Enrollment System was proposed. The said system will
help the school turn manual system into a computerized one. It helps

particularly the ICT-In charge of the school, principal, advisers and GPTA

Payroll is the method of processing various components such as the
daily time record and other factors in creating the exact salary of every
employee in a company. The human resource manages the whole system to
give the exact amount of pay with the use of multiple included data. The
processing of a company’s payroll involves multiple steps that are susceptible
to automation. (D. Kahn, S. Saini, S.E. Kreimer, S.S. Ferguson. 2002.)
Companies must withhold income tax from employee’s earnings like
SSS, Philhealth and other benefits from the employee’s wages. Payroll system
computes employee’s taxes, deductions and salary. It as well uses the datum
to issue paychecks. These systems also typically prepare payroll reports for
management & tax purposes for federal states & local government according
to the book of Understanding Computers. (Jalbuena, 2014.)
The payroll system is one of the useful system that every company or
business needs. This system can minimize the work load involved in
maintaining the employee’s overall account. It reduces human efforts and helps

in maintaining an error-free employee record.

"KNOW CARAGA: AN ANDROID GAME APPLICATION
","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This research entitled, “Know Caraga: An Android Game Application” is
a promotional tool for the entire Caraga region. The core concept of the
application is to let the player choose between the three(3) categories namely,
“Know Me More” which tackles about the history or information of each
province, the second one is “Trulse”, it is named after the combination of a
type of quiz “True or False”, this category focuses on the artifacts that have
been found on the land, also it gives us the calendar of events that is
celebrated in each places, and the last one is the “Caraga’s best’, it shows

the beauty of the tourist spots offered by the nature of Caraga.

After gaining up knowledge from the lessons, the game will proceed to
a different type of quizzes which depends on what category they’ve chosen.
For the category Know Caraga, you can play a fill in the blank, for the Trulse,
it is true or false, and for the Caraga’s best it is a multiple-choice type of quiz.
Each quiz completed, the player will be given points that can be redeemable
at a partnered physical store. With this additional feature, the player will not

only benefit from learning but also, they can have freebies using their points.

","14.1. Introduction

According to Salen & Zimmerman (2003), “A game is a system in
which players engage in an artificial conflict, defined by rules that result in a
quantifiable outcome.” The game is known to be a mental and physical
enhancer to every player. It is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for
enjoyment. It generally involves mental or physical stimulation, and often both.
Many games such as strategy, puzzle, and simulation help develop practical
skills, serve as a form of exercise. The game varies nowadays. The famous

ones are the mobile and computer games.

According to the survey conducted by the researchers to the five (5)
professionals, five (5) students of ACLC of Butuan, five (5) civilians, and five
(5) players, a total of twenty (20) populations, games nowadays are inclined to
be entertaining which provides amusement to the players. More often than not
most of it doesn’t provide any educational values to the players— a problem in
which according to our survey that we have conducted that most of the games
they have played gave them bad effects. Aside from that, the proponents also
asked if educational games are dominant in society nowadays, all of them
answered that there are more non-educational games that exist nowadays.
There are some educational games that exist on the internet, but nonetheless,

there are few educational games that promote a place, city or even region.
As a result, the proponents proposed an educational game namely KNOW

CARAGA.

Know CARAGA is an educational game that will help promote the
region CARAGA and at the same time help educates the players about the
history and the beauty of the region. It also focused on how to boost the
players and students' motivation to learn, as well as their interest in the

"ACLC E-CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
","ACLC E-Classroom Management System is designed as a useful tool
to help the ACLC of Butuan for their learning process. It provides some
features that will improve the interaction of instructors and students during or

after class hours.

The proponents are well aware that there plenty of existing systems
that have the same functions and features that are used by other schools. In
that case, the proponents provided a feature that is not available on other
existing systems and that is the data integration of Student Information
System (SIS) and Enrollment System of ACLC so that the system will
automatically generate all the data. With these feature, the proponents
believed that it would help the ACLC of Butuan to improve the deliberation of

each class because the system will immediately assign the class sectioning.

To this end, the proponents therefore concluded that, ACLC E-
classroom Management System was able to achieve all the objectives and it
can be used to help the ACLC of Butuan. Furthermore, the mean result of the

Survey conducted is 90.4 the system is considered as efficient.
","Classroom management refers to the wide variety of skills and
techniques that instructors use to keep students organized, orderly,
focused, attentive, on task, and academically productive during a class (S.
Abbott, et. al. 2014). Also, it is a method on how an instructor can manage
all the students during or after class hour and it’s the process of ensuring
that classroom lessons run smoothly despite of the disruptive deliberation

of learning.

Classroom management is crucial in classrooms because it supports
the proper execution of curriculum development, developing best
teaching practices, and putting them into action. Classroom
management can be explained as the actions and directions that
teachers use to create a successful learning environment: indeed,
having a positive impact on students achieving given learning
requirements and goals (Soheili, et. al. 2012). James Duderstadt (2000),
a former president of the University of Michigan, stated in his book, A
University for the 21st Century, that universities should: 1) move beyond
the roles of research, education and service and be a knowledge server
engaged in producing, conserving, distributing, and applying knowledge
to different contexts; 2) serve as learning communities for teachers,

learners, and graduates by preparing them to engage in life-long
It is evident from the cited studies that the instructors and students can
only communicate during their class hours. The instructor can only give a
quiz or an exercise to the students only during class hours. Also, when the
instructor will give an assignment or activities to the students for the next
meeting there would be some possibilities of misunderstanding about the

instructions or directions for the given home work.

Methods for the solutions of the stated problem are to develop an e —
classroom management system that will help ACLC of Butuan to improve
the interaction between instructors and students to assist them in their
learning process. It is a huge contribution in the part of the instructors as
well as the students in the way of communicating through web for
educational purposes. In addition, the proponents get the information from
the Student Information System (SIS) and Enrollment System of AMA
Computer Learning Center though data integration. All the data generated

will automatically display on ACLC E-Classroom Management System.

"ACLC Test Bank
","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Technology nowadays is growing at a quick pace and it affects the
developing organization’s success. The evolution of technology plays an
important role in developing this system. ACLC Butuan is one of the growing
institutions whose faculty continues to use manual process in creating test
questionnaires. With this in mind, the researcher proposes to create a system

that will replace the manual system to provide the ACLC faculty with more

efficient service.

ACLC Test Bank is a system mainly for Dean, Program Head, Instructors
and Printing in-charge. ACLC is still using the manual process in making test
questionnaire every examination. As this problem found by the proponents, we
come up to a decision in developing the ACLC Test Banking System to provide
the instructors an easier and faster way to create test questionnaires, table of
specifications and syllabi. The instructors don’t need to create new questions
and test questionnaires because it is already stored in the ACLC Test Banking
System. They can create new questions if their questions are not yet saved in

the system. They can also modify test questionnaires saved on the system.
","“Examination is a formal test of a person's knowledge or
proficiency in a particular subject or skill” (Jolanta Lapiak Handspeak,
2010). Test plays an important role as it provides benefits between the
instructor and the student. The instructor can assess the students
through an exam and give direct assessment and students can achieve

self-assessment for them to monitor their studies.

Through interview conducted by the proponents with the dean,
instructors and program heads in different department, the proponents
found out that AMA Computer Learning Center is still using the manual
method in creating test questionnaires. There are problems found in
using this method in creating, submitting, checking and approving of test
questionnaire and table of specification such as no storing of test
questions, it consumes more papers in revising the test questionnaire
and table of specification during checking. Instructors will create first the
syllabus that contains the topics for the whole semester are utilized as
guidelines. Creating test questionnaires based on the table of

specification that follows the Bloom’s taxonomy aligned
Zz

to the topics indicated in the syllabus of the instructor. The
program head and dean for the specific department will now check the
created test questionnaire and table of specification of the instructor if
the questions conform to the appropriate cognitive level domain

requirements.

The proponents came up with the idea in proposing a test banking
system. The test banking system will enable the instructor to create
syllabi, test questionnaire and table of specification as well as retrieve
test questions and test questionnaire depending on the subject they are

teaching.

The program head can check, approve, reject and put remarks on
the test questionnaire that the instructor created. The dean can double
check the test questionnaire, reject and approve test questionnaire for
printing. The system can queue the test questionnaire to be printed with
a copy of each test questionnaire. Test banking generates reports such
as approved, rejected, printed, pending and late test questionnaire and
table of specification list, also offers Systems notification, chatting and
SMS notification for additional features. By this, it can improve the way

of creating, passing, checking, printing, retrieving and storing of test

questionnaires.

"ANDROID FACE SWAPPING APPLICATION
","With the use of the Android Studio and OpenCV, the proponents were
able to create an android application that can swap faces through live camera
feed. Thus, the proponents entitled it as the Android Face Swapping
Application. With the use of smart phones, camera manipulation by adding
photo effects became a trend, and from there, the face-swapping feature had
been born and the proponents have thought to study it and make their own.

Through this study, the proponents have been aware that camera
manipulation is the building block of the so-called augmented reality which is
now being studied by IT professionals today. The augmented reality has a
tremendous impact to our future because it alters reality real time. For
example, an application that analyzes signboards with foreign words and
translates it to English through a live camera feed. It is an application which
can help numerous of foreign travelers that does not know any other language
than their own. Therefore, by studying the basics of the camera manipulation,
we can improve our understanding of augmented reality and maybe in the
future, the proponents can think of an application that can be beneficial to the

community.

The Android Face Swapping Application has one major feature which
is of course, to swap faces in real time. But since Swapping two faces is too
common, the proponents decided to increase the number of faces to be
Swapped into a minimum of three faces up to five. The proponents therefore
used the object-oriented programming as the approach in creating the
application which is best suited with the android java language.
","The camera can imitate the image of the environment. It is basically
used for production, Socialization, business and other purposes. Many
applications utilize the camera to perform processes easily by taking
Photos, videos and recordings. Camera can also now perform
complicated tasks, thus, Information Technology developers have

integrated art into it by using camera manipulation to create effects such

as photo filters, face detection, face swapping and much more.

Since IT developers are increasing, the number of innovations in
technologies and applications becomes greater. Due to competition,
privacy and other purposes, some processes of creating the
technologies and applications are hidden. One of those is an innovative
app that is trending in the market nowadays is the face swapping.
However, none of the source codes of any existing face swapping
applications such as Snapchat, Snow, Hong Chou Face Swap, Magic
Mirror and others are available for other developers to refer.
Furthermore, it has been found out that only Snapchat and Snow can

swap two or more person's faces, while others, including the Hong Chou

Face Swap and Magic Mirror can only swap two faces.
The proponents became interested about the beauty of camera
Manipulation Particularly the face swapping, face detection and image
Processing. Therefore, the proponents proposed to develop “Android
Face Swapping Application” that enables users to randomly swap more
than two person’s faces in real-time face detection using android
phone’s front and back camera. Faces should be detected before being
swapped with another. To detect a face, camera must capture any facial

landmarks such as the eyes, nose, and lips, which are all located in the

convex hull of the face.

Lastly, the study was developed to share its documentation & source
code of the algorithm of android face swapping application. The future
|.T developers can now access the source code of the algorithm of face

swapping feature. Also, the people can now enjoy swapping two or more

faces other than Snapchat and Snow.

psychological aspects that require conceptual skills. ‘There are even a couple of tests
to Measure someone’s Capability of planning well. As such, planning is a fundamental
property of intelligent behaviour. A financial plan often includes a budget which
organizes an individual's finances and sometimes includes a series of steps or specific
goals for spending and saving in the future. This plan allocates future income to

various types of expenses, such as rent or utilities, and also reserves some income for

short-term and long-term savings.

In today's mobile world, there should be no question as to whether a business
should have a Mobile Application. Everyone loves the same inspiring world of mobile
application development. Whether it is a business tablet utility application or a

popular mobile game, apps are operating on smart phones and users are running with
smarter and better applications.

The researchers conducted a survey at ACLC College of Butuan and gathered

data from 10 respondents consist of students, instructors and staff during the
d .

2™ semester S.Y 2016-2017. According to the survey, there are respondents said that
they are having a hard time dealing with the manual concept of budgeting such as
paper listing, because it needs to exert effort, it does not provide a reminder or

notification to the respondents, and it is not handy.

A problem identified amongst the following respondents observed is the
difficulty of financial planning in setting their goals.They want to manage their
finances, but didn’t know where to start and they don’t have time to do their own

financial planning because they don’t have tools to guide them.

Therefore, the proponents came up with an idea to develop BAON personal
planner mobile application. The application modernizes the existing concept of
planning, goal setting or budgeting, for it is handy for the users from which they can

input data and receive a notification that would set as a reminder.

Technology nowadays is growing fast and it affects the developing

developing this system. ACLC Butuan is one of the growing institutions. The
finance department of ACLC still using the old Assessment and Cashiering
System with an error occurs. The proponents proposed to create new: system
which still in-line with the process of the old system to replace the old system

and eliminate those errors and boost the service of the institution to their clients.

.Assessment and Cashiering eysier with Online Queuing is a system
mainly for Accounting and Cashier Staff and Queue Administrator. The ACLC
especially in the finance department is still using the old system which the user
cannot ‘add or save raw fees of the students in the system, there is no system
user management where the administrators can add or update users and
provide a privilege to access the system of a certain user also the system is
developed using the VB6 platform; there are compatibility issues between the
said platform and new operating systems and errors there are errors found and
the queuing system is limited only for three stations. As this problem found by
the proponents, we come up to a decision in developing the ACB Educational
Assessment and Cashiering System with Online Queuing which develop using
PHP platform to provide a new system and eliminate those errors found. This

system has user management which staff can add or update user, also it can
vi

add raw fees of students and the queuing is enhance it can add stations and

can queue through web and mobile.
","1.1

Project Context

The AMA Computer Learning Center College of Butuan (ACB)
was established on July 7, 1997. Since ACB had just an average
population of students back on the 90’s, it was effective to use manual

processing of payment transactions and assessing students’ fees.

Until the year 2006 the school’s student population has risen, in
order to manage the growing number of population, the institution started
using the computerized assessment and cashiering system that is
dependent to School Management System to have the data of students
enrolled in the institution to process the assessment and payment
transactions of the students. Until today, the ACB is still using the
Assessment and Cashiering System to facilitate every transaction of the
institution. Basic transactions are working well and can be managed by
the (system’s manager) programmer who maintains the system. But
there are underlying problems of the said system like generating
assessments and issuing receipts that all of the system users are very
dependent on the system maintenance personnel when it comes to the

back-end transactions and components.
The current Assessment and Cashiering System lacks features

that are necessary to the overall function of the system.

Stated below are the main problems which regard to the

functional of the system:

First, the user cannot add or save raw fees of the students in the
system. Raw fees are fees or particulars that the system will compute to
generate the bill or assessment of the student. If ever there are changes
in the raw fees, the system maintenance personnel will directly add or

amend the raw fees in the database.

Second, there is no system user management where the
administrators can add or update users and provide a privilege to access
the system of a certain user. If new user will be added, again, the system
maintenance personnel will access directly to the database to add a new
user. When it comes to adding particulars, the system maintenance
personnel must still input the needed information to the database.

Third, due to the reason that the current Assessment and
Cashiering System developed using the VB6 platform, there are
compatibility issues between the said platform and new operating
systems especially nowadays, most of the computers are already using
latest operating systems with no longer support older version of Visual

Basic.
Fourth, the system database is not normalized causing

redundancy of data and occupies more space in the database.

Lastly, the queuing system only allows three stations to serve,
making it difficult if there are other departments requested for queue

slots in the system.

With this problem in hand, the overall performance of the system
deteriorates. Security is at risk since the maintenance personnel can
directly access the database every update and no user management that
will prevent user to use all features according to their function. In terms
of system's reliability and availability, the raw data is not updated by the
system maintenance personnel so the system cannot process and give
accurate information thus affects system credibility. On the system's
scalability, the database is not normalized, data redundancy is inevitable
thus if data input becomes larger in number that may cause space

shortage.

To address the aforementioned concems, the proponents
proposed the ACLC College of Butuan Educational Assessment and
Cashiering System with Online Queuing intended to be a web-based
system that is Dependent to School Management System to have the
data of students enrolled in the institution which is dynamic and

interactive that is capable of giving proper data, efficient storage use and

","4.1 Introduction

As of early 2013, 56 percent of American adults owned smart phones,
and by the end of 2014, there were nearly 7 billions mobile cellular
subscribers worldwide. We believe it is inevitable that these devices will
become the primary portals by which humans interact with services, including
remote services (e.g. banking) and more local ones (e.g. Automatic Teller
Machines) (Libonati, A., et al., 2014). Because these devices are vulnerable
to theft, security of this data is put at higher risk-once the attacker is in
physical possession of the device, recovering these credentials and
impersonating the owner of the phone is hard to defend by purely local
means. (Caine, K., et al., 2014). Global Position System (GPS) is a
technology where satellites send down radio signals. In utilizing this
technology, user can locate the exact address of the thief. (Danu, R. 2016).
This application uses the latest technology like Short Message Services;
(SMS) through using it, you can track theft's current location IMSI number
changed. (Kumar, R. V., et al., 2015). A number of researchers are being held
on the issue of obtaining private information on Android devices using
multimedia such as microphones and cameras. One of the issues is basic
camera attack model. This kind of attack will capture image secretly from

Android device camera without getting known to user. We will use this
disadvantage in a positive direction to control device and collect information
from device remotely. (Chouhan, J. G., et al., 2016).

Seeing many of these missing cases, we tried to develop a system for
tracking and securing a missing phone. (Krisitan, Y et al., 2013). With an
increasing number of organizations allowing personal smart phones onto their
networks, considerable security risk was introduced. The security risk is
exacerbated by the tremendous heterogeneity of the personal mobile devices
and their respective installed pool of applications. (Van Bruggen, D., et al.,
2013). It's not the device itself that's so valuable to those victims, but the data
stored on those smartphones, as Lookout notes. This includes anything from
photos to videos, contacts, music, apps, and banking information. The survey
also found that 44% of smartphones were stolen because owners had
forgotten them in a public setting, and 14% of devices were taken from a car

or house that was burglarized. Only 11% of victims had their smartphone

stolen off personally. (Eadicicco, L. 2014).

Though there are some android phone theft application that already
existed such as Android Device Manager, these applications can easily be by-
passed and rendered useless once the thief perform a factory reset on the
phone. This would turn the phone fresh as a new device. And also, these
applications heavily relies on Internet/Wi-Fi services alone and as such, if
there's no connection available to the device, these application wouldn't

properly execute their functions that could potentially help track/locate the
stolen phone. In some instances, the thief would pull out the phone SIM card

which would make tracking even more difficult.

In response to the abovementioned problems, the proponents have
decided to develop an android phone security application that could help
mitigate the increasing number of missing phones. The features that were
implemented to the application is locating the current location of the phone
through Global Positioning System (GPS) and Short Messages Service (SMS)
as a trigger and it also has a feature that could capture the image of the thief.
When the SIM card is ejected from the phone, the application will
automatically acquire the new number of the phone and it will send the
information back to the tracker. The owner of the phone can send a trigger to
record the activity of the thief through audio recording, send a copy of SMS
conversation, and even call logs. The proponents took a counter measure in
response to the wiping of data through factory reset by rooting the phone and
converting the application to be recognized as a system app so that it can no

longer be uninstalled.

"WEB - BASED DIGITIZED MAP OF BARANGAY BAYANIHAN
","Executive Summary

Web-based digitized map of barangay Bayanihan helps the barangay
itself for faster access to the map by turning a manual map into a Web-based
map. Also it allows the user to update the map, view it easily and can print the
map with the authority of the admin. It also has a security which helped
protect the information of the map which has different log-in forms for admin
and other users. The study aims to give efficiency in barangay Bayanihan
especially to its officer's services and transactions. Based on the result we
gathered it is guaranteed that this system would help the processing of
transactions efficient and the answer of the Barangay Bayanihans long term
problem. | conclude that the Web Based Digitized Map of Barangay
Bayanihan would be of great help to the people of Barangay Bayanihan. It
eliminates the burden of understanding the manual drawing of the map, aside
it being time-consuming, it is also unsecured information about the map. More
importantly, it improves their security of information and efficiency in
accommodating more people in a single day because they can now process

the map fast with less error.
","Barangay is the most basic government unit in the Philippines
according to the local government code (Section 58d). As a basic political
unit, it is the primary planning and implementing unit of government policies,

plans, programs, projects and activities in the community.

Barangay 27 also known as Bayanihan uses a manual process in
providing and handling information and files. These records are important for
different purposes especially for its development. There are government and
private projects that needs information from the map of the said barangay for
its projects and plans to be visualized, the barangay then provide their manual

spot map which is hard to understand and not liable.

To prevent lost tracks of the map of the barangay the researchers
developed a system which is the Barangay Bayanihan Digitized Web Based
Map. Digitized Mapping is the process by which a collection of data is
compiled and formatted into a virtual image. The primary function of this
technology is to produce maps that give accurate representations of a
particular area, detailing major road arteries and other points of interest. The

technology also allows the calculation of distances from one place to another.

Though digital mapping can be found in a variety of computer

applications, such as Google Earth, the main use of this system is to allow
users to view and locate a certain “Purok” specifically in Barangay 27 —

Bayanihan alone, which Barangay 27 — Bayanihan has a total of 341 hectares

with specific location and puroks. Digitized Mapping benefit the Barangay in

its development.

"A WEB BASED ACCESS PORTAL TO FACILITATE FUND SOURCING
AND TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT FOR SCHOLARS AND SPONSORS
","ABSTRACT

Web Based Access Portal to Facilitate Fund Sourcing and Transaction
Management for Scholars and Sponsor has been developed to provide
scholarship for the students who are not capable in paying tuition fees or not
well enough. Also to guide potential sponsors where they can share their
blessings by supporting a student and choosing for scholarship to support.
The system is able to generate code name of the student which will be
presented to the sponsor instead of their full name. It also has four users
which is the administrator, scholar in-charge, funds in-charge and sponsor.
The study used System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as a method which
applied while developing the system. The design involves Entity Relationship
Diagram (ERD) and Data Flow Diagram (DFD) to show the logical flow for the
system. For the implementation, Apache is used as a web server, MySQL for
database, PHP Laravel as a scripting language and Google Chrome as a
browser. The proponents conducted survey for the software quality of the
system to the scholar coordinator and possible sponsors and was acceptable
based on the total mean obtained of 3.89. The system evaluation was based
from real users and the system is able to perform the task correctly.

","4.1 Rationale of the Study

After more than two decades, Somalia children lost the chance for formal
education. This country is one of the world’s lowest enrolment rates that only
30 percent of student could be able to go to school. The highest rate of
poverty in community of Somalia makes it hard for parents to afford their
children studies or even on their school fees. That is the main reason why
they give up not sending their children to school. This data is based on the

United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) report.

According to ABS-CBN news report that there are 3.8 million of Filipinos
are out of school youth (OSCYs), 87.3 percent were 16 to 24 years old, 7.7
percent were 12 to 15 years old, and 5.0 percent were 6 to 11 years old.
Survey result shows that having a high cost of education and financial
concern is the main reason of dropping out or not attending in college. The
data was based according to a 2016 survey by Philippine Statistic Authority
(PSA).

Since college is the most expensive it's ever been. A large number of
students don’t complete or finish their studies due to lack of funds and high
education cost (Patel and McWhirter, 2019). Considering the difficulties in
college, there are still students who wants to pursue their studies. Even if they

rely on loans to get them through continue schooling to pay their tuition

(Hoffower et al., 2019).
Scholarship program is the possible answer of those diligent students
and committed to their study. It is about money and sponsoring related to
guide the needy students. It gives the chance to a various individuals to gain

education (Schenberg et al., 2002).

"ACLC COURSE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
","vii

Executive Summary

ACLC Course Recommendation System is implemented to consider
the matter that ACLC of Butuan has an existing system for placement exam
but produces no results. Extra modules and functions are also executed which

are not available in the existing system.

The primary objective of this project is to support the student from
choosing course during the enrollment period. The system has the ability to
recommend courses that are appropriate for the student’s skills and
knowledge. Examination is required as part of the whole course
recommendation process. The student’s score serves as a reliable basis that

the system recommends the appropriate courses for them.
","1.1 Project Context

Course selection can be difficult for new upcoming college Students
that are appropriate for their Proficiency. In most cases we rely on
recommendations from newspapers, people, or the Internet. But these
resources may not be €nough as reliance in choosing the appropriate
courses.

Most Colleges and Universities are using an automated course
recommendation system where results are automatically produced. AMA
Computer Learning Center (ACLC) of Butuan has an existing system for
placement exam where freshmen Students take before an enrollment.
However, the System produces no decision support making after taking the

€xam which is not counselling students what course he/she is qualified.

With the problem identified, the Proponents proposed a Course
Recommendation System for ACLC Butuan that will Produce decision Support
System for course Selection that fits the Student’s proficiency. The placement
©xam will be part of the System where the student take the examination and
automatically Calculate the student exam result and formulate into course

recommendation using the Stanine Paradigm.
ACLC Course Recommendation System will be a benefit for both
school and students. It helps the school recommend courses to students in an

automated process and helps students select the course suitable for their
knowledge.

"EXPERT SYSTEM FOR DISH RECOMMENDATION
","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The study is Expert System for Dish Recommendation. This is about
getting the knowledge of a dish expert or a chef and convert it into logical
machine program on how the dish expert or a chef decides after they answer
series of questions and the same thought on how the application generates dish
recipes after the user answered series of questions. This is all about cloning the

decision and translating the rules into terms that a machine can understand.

The proponents proposed to develop the Expert System for Dish
Recommendation that generates possible recipes depending on the answered

questions to the application.
","Search engines can bring up thousands of recipes for any
given dish.Surely you will choose the one that does not need you to
rush to the supermarket to buy the missing ingredients. Often times you
can make that effort, especially if you have guests coming over for a
meal. But if you are feeling tired or lazy and just want to prepare
something satisfying out of whatever you have in your fridge, the usual

cookbook would not work. You need a reverse-recipe search engine.

According to (Nwachukwu, 2015), Expert System is an
intelligent computer program that uses knowledge from an inference to
solve problem that are difficult enough to require significant human
expertise for their solution and according to (Jackson 1999), an expert
system is a computer program and reasons with knowledge of some

specialist subject with a vi ew to solving problems or giving advice.

"SURIGAO DEL NORTE TOURIST GUIDE APPLICATION
WITH MAPPING
","Executive Summary

This study is conducted in order to help tourists to have an €asy access
in finding tourist spots within Surigao Del Norte. For the past years, Surigao
De! Norte doesn’t have its own tourist guide application so the researchers
sought ways to create a tourist guide application exclusively in Surigao Del

Norte that can help to boost their tourism industry.

The application would locate all the tourist destination in Surigao del
Norte which includes the nature parks, landscapes and seascapes, island
adventure, religious and cultural heritage, city tours, accommodations and
other outdoor adventure such as mountain trekking and caving. Surigao Del

Norte Tourist guide with mapping also shows the description of tourist spots.

To successfully develop the Surigao del Norte Tourist Guide Application
with Mapping, the proponents need to meet the tool requirements such as
Google Maps API that allows in displaying maps in the application since the
main part of the project is about mapping, java programming language, XML,
Command Prompt (CMD), Android Studio, Firebase, XAMPP, Sublime,
android phones or tablet where an APK is installed to test and run the
application, an internet connection which helps the proponents browse over
the internet about the related Studies of the application, and laptop or

computer where the entire application is being developed, coded and build.

","1.1 Introduction

Surigao del Norte is a formation of group of islands at the rim of the Asian
continental shelf and is located at the northeastern part of Mindanao, Region
XIII, CARAGA, according to their tourism’s website. The province is composed
of 21 municipalities, 449 puroks and 54 barangays which is politically divided
into two congressional districts. District | comprises the islands of Siargao and
Bucas Grande that has 9 municipalities. District || includes Surigao City, the
provincial capital, and 12 mainland municipalities. And it has an area of 288,905
hectares of 2,740.14 square kilometers which is roughly equivalent to 9.67
percent of the total land area of Northern Mindanao, as stated at the Surigao

del Norte’s website.

This province is popular not only to the Filipinos but also one of the best
tourists’ destination among foreign people for it is blessed with its rich
environment. According to tripadvisor Philippines, Surigao del Norte Province
has 8,045 reviews and opinions as evidence that there are many tourists love
to visit the place to experience its amazing discoveries. It is a place where many
types of attractions are found specifically its nature parks, landscapes and
seascapes, island adventure, religious and cultural heritage, city tours,
accommodations and other outdoor adventure such as mountain trekking and
caving. There are most visited islands in Surigao that is like a paradise for its

famous, long stretch of sugar-fine beaches, perfect surfs, vast mangrove forest,
and deep waters teeming with a plethora of marine life. Furthermore, enhancing

caves, magnificent rock formations and mountain lakes provides a perfect
ambience for the thrill seeker and highly-strong individuals. Thus, it is called a
Shangri-La for adventurers where beautiful places are found and a tropical gem

that has managed to preserve its beauty through the years.

Surigao del Norte is known for its amazing environment features that tourists
seeks adventures, but unfortunately, the proponents found out that it has lack
of direction guidance that would be beneficial for those who are new to the
place. In other words, there is no existing system or application that Surigao
has that can help tourists being guided along its way to their destination.
Therefore, the proponents prompted to innovate an application entitled Surigao
del Norte Tourist Guide Application with Mapping, that will help all the tourists

in Surigao del Norte to have a guide on the direction on what places they

wanted to go.

","Conventional fire hydrants are generally quite robust and reliable units.
They are relatively simple devices that provides the required reliability. After all,
it is absolutely critical that a fire hydrant be capable of operating as required upon
demand, as an alternative is the potential for major property destruction, and
perhaps serious injury and loss of life (Wasmeyahh M. A. S. Al Azemi, 2013).
This invention relates to a hydrant locator that facilitates the location of a hydrant
by firefighters, particularly in an emergency. The low profile device wraps around
the hydrant cylinder for mounting purposes and a switch in an emergency vehicle
sets off strobe lights on the device upon activation to alert firefighters to the
hydrant location. In fighting fires, time is a crucial factor and precious time is often
wasted searching for a fire hydrant. Ideally, firefighters want to hook up to the

nearest hydrant for purposes of water pressure and running less hose.

This invention comprises a hydrant locator which is low profile and wraps
around the cylinder of the hydrant but does not interfere with discharges from the
hydrant. The locator device comprises a plurality of solar powered strobe lights
that are strapped about the hydrant alternating with solar panels. A locked latch
secures the locator belt of strobe lights and solar panels to the hydrant. A
shatterproof shield is mounted over the strobe lights and solar panels. A receiver
is also mounted within the locator to activate the strobe lights upon receipt of a
remote signal. In use, a remote switch located in an emergency vehicle is

coupled to a transmitter to send a signal to the receiver activating only those
hydrant locators within a given range of approximately 1500 feet. Further the
switch can activate a different colour strobe light to indicate the Closeness of the
hydrant. Accordingly, an object of this invention is to provide a new and improved
hydrant locator according to Erik Martin (2004). The use of water, by fire brigades
throughout the world, has its roots set deeply in history. The provision of that
supply has varied dependent on its availability and industrial and social

development according to Stephen Moore (2003).

Research by Catton (1988) and Fowler (2001) has indicated that the
quantity of hydrants installed and the cost of maintenance and testing have led
brigades to consider if they are responsible for too many hydrants. The present
invention is a fire hydrant accessory which provides remote signalling to a central
location, such as a water treatment plant system control and data acquisition
control room, of a sensed parameter at a fire hydrant location. The sensed
parameter can be any one or more of detection of tampering of fire hydrant, water
pressure, temperature of the water flowing through the hydrant, temperature of
the ambient air surrounding the hydrant, etc. Uniquely, the remote signal from a
fire hydrant carries a discrete fire hydrant identification or location indicator which
can be correlated to the specific location or street address dispatch of emergency
response equipment and personnel, to the fire hydrant for repair, etc. (Zoratti,
M.2004). Another invention called fire hydrant locating system includes a fire
hydrant locator that facilitates the location of a hydrant by firefighting, particularly

in an emergency vehicle such as fire engine. The hydrant locator as secured to
the hydrant cylinder has a low profile. The hydrant locating system includes a
transmitter adapter to be located in the emergency vehicle. Upon actuation of a

switch in the transmitter in the emergency a receiver-signal generator in the
hydrant locator will be activated to set off strobe lights to alert firefighters of the

hydrant locator (Bilbery R., et. Al 2007).

The current traditional system of paper documents adopted by Fire
Department had led to the inability of the fire fighters to locate usable and
functioning hydrants in an efficient and effective manner which can jeopardize
any rescue mission. Hence, there is a need to revised the Fire Department
current system and develop a new system that is much more easier, portable
and also time and cost effective in locating the fire hydrants. There are two main
functions of this system which are to locate, view and map fire hydrants and its
related information to assist fire fighters during inspection, maintenances and
emergency cases and to display fire hydrants information to public to facilitates
them in identifying the location and codes of the hydrants that are found to be in
poor condition and assists them to inform Fire Department through

“TemanPiliBomba’ application. (Muhamad Syahir Shadin, 201 5).

"REAL ESTATE REGISTRATION SYSTEM WITH GEOGRAPHIC
INFORMATION SYSTEM (GIS)
","Real estate registration systems are systems or software that keep
track of real properties available for sale. Using these systems, one can view
information on real estate properties without the need to visit the actual sites.
It also provides system administrators means to keep records of the
transactions involved in the sale of real properties.

GIS is a computer system for storing, displaying, checking related data
about the position on earth surface. GIS can show data in one map to help
people analyze and compare and differentiate the relationship of things in the
earth’s terrain. It also includes locations such as farms, housing and other
relevant establishments.

The Real Estate Registration System with GIS will provide potential
buyers a means to search desired locations at a glance. This is made
possible by utilizing accurate GlS-based maps and up-to-date data from the
local Land Registration Authority. It also lifts the burden from the land sellers
in advertising their properties and alleviates the hassle in real estate sales
processing. With the help of the GlS-based property finder, viewers can use
smartphones or tablets with browsers to easily access the site. The system

also track the available property for sale and it can locate exact location of the

property instead of visiting personally.

The Real Estate Registration System with GIS will help to locate the

","1.1 Project Context

Real Estate Registration System are systems that keep track of
properties that are available for sale. Using these systems, the information the
property can be viewed online without the need to visit the actual site. It also
provides a system administrator to keep records of the transactions involved
in selling the property.

Real Estate is the way of buying and selling valuable properties like
house and lots. It involves: identifying clients, conducting research to identify
real estate needs, arranging meetings with prospective clients, providing
analytical support for cash flow and other financial analyses as well as
gathering market data. Letters of intent proposing business terms to
prospecting clients help build strong client relationships by delivering best,

high class, quality service which includes providing relevant information to
clients on timely basis. Planning and communicating become easier now with
the use of technology. Geographic Information System (GIS) is one of the
innovations making it easy to locate a particular site in Google Map or any

properties related to the position on earth’s surface.

Geographic information system (GIS) is a computer system for storing,

checking and displaying data about specific position or location on the earth's
surface. GIS can show data in one map to help people analyze, compare and
differentiate the relationship of things in the earth’s terrain. It also includes
locations such as farms, housing and other relevant establishments. Much
different information may be compared and contrasted using GIS. For
example, a GlS-generated map could include sites that produce high market
value of properties. Earlier technologies only rely on Google Map to locate a
certain property on the earth’s surface. This poses a problem especially when
uploading and capturing data on one map. Existing real estate registration
systems without GIS still have some flaws. Some of these systems provide
locations using Google maps, as can be seen at www.propertyfinderph.com.
Though these provide the location of the properties, they cannot provide the
exact coordinates and measurements of the properties. Other systems, like
www.property24.com.ph only provide Google Maps. These maps do not even
provide markers to pinpoint the exact location of the real property. They do
not utilize GIS to present the exact location of a particular area. The existing
real estate registration systems still utilize the traditional search bar.
Searching for properties involves typing on a search bar. With the use of the
traditional search bar, results are displayed as images that fits as to what is
being searched. For Real Estate buyers, searching for the availability of
properties in certain areas is difficult. It is also virtually impossible to subdivide
land having exact measurements without visiting it physically.
These problems are addressed in the proposed Real Estate
Registration System. Using the data gathered from the local City Assessor's

Office, the area of the involved properties can be plotted on the map,

pinpointing its exact location. Using this method, the exact shape and
measurements of an identified property can be visualized by just looking at a
map. The proposed system will also feature a map-based search where
viewers can browse and filter the properties displayed on the map. By utilizing
the data obtained from local government agencies and GIS software, the
system will be able to provide suggestions on how to subdivide real properties

in cases where the property for sale is only a part of a much bigger property

or land.

"BUILDING SECURITY ALARM SYSTEM USING RASPBERRY Pi
","The proponents came up with an idea of developing a security system
that uses Raspberry Pi 3 due to the observations around the community which
the proponents realized that the crimes like burglary is still common in the
vicinity. According to the PNP Statistic Crime Report as of 2013, there are
around sixty nine percent (69%) crime rate that had been reported to the police
which is related to theft and burglary which makes it top of all kinds of crime

against property in the entire CARAGA.

The proponents want to develop a security system that helps the
residents, house owners, and businessmen to alarm and inform that there is an
intrusion event even if the said people are in the remote areas, and able to
receive an image that has been captured by the camera included in the security

system and can see it through android smartphone.

The proponents also want to make this study as a reference to the future
proponents who are studying in ACLC College of Butuan, who are planning to
propose and make a project that is related to security systems, and to those

who want to improve the proponents’ current project.
","small towns or rural areas, unless the latter are particularly wealthy and live
close to a large urban area. Burglars tend to choose detached houses and
properties near the ends of streets. They also avoid houses that are clearly
occupied. Known offenders generally operate relatively close to home. Physical
crime prevention measures are often of little or no help in keeping a burglar out,
since a burglars main concem is to find an unobserved access point to an
unoccupied house,” and a study by P. F. Cromwell, et al. (1991) found that
burglars employ a three component decision making strategy. The burglar
assumes that each proposed target site, whether the target site contains at
least some minimal potential gain, determines whether the target site can be
broken into without being seen and reported, and determines whether the target

site can be broken readily.

Ashton R. (2015) suggested that most people should own a burglar
alarms as he stated in that “we are not exempted in crimes like robbery and
burglaries.” Thus, the proponents want to implement a security system the

focuses only for detection of the intrusion.

According to Waller, |., & Okihiro N. R. (1978), “The realities of the
burglary experience are examined, with a view to prevention and improving the
way the society reacts, in this analysis based on personal interviews in some
1,600 Toronto, Canada household. Interviews were also held with convicted
burglars to examine how they chose particular residential targets, why they

broke in and what type of goods they sought. Three major questions were
addressed: ‘how often’, ‘where’, and in ‘what manner do residential burglaries
occur’. The data collected indicates that residential burglary is typically a minor
offense, committed by an amateur, and involving relatively small property loss,
with rarely a threat or actual harm. Further, of the 3 residences in every 100
that are burglarized, more than 1 of 3 will go unreported to the police. It was
also found out that more than 10 percent of the population admits to committing
burglary and that burglary is more likely if a residence is left unattended during
the working week and if entrances are not easily visible to neighbors.” The
proponents came up an idea that may able to help the community, especially

to the people who are at work, and not always at their home by involving the
technology.

Inventor Mallory J (1984) said that there is an increasing popularity rate
of security alarm systems in residential communities. The most common form
of sensors in residential areas and homes is the form of fire and smoke detector,
but Mallory J (1984) added that “there has been increased use in residential

areas of intrusion or burglar alarms, and also devices which monitor the status
of various appliances in the home.”

Inventor Glidewell W. E., et al (1994) proposed an invention which
relates generally to security systems. More particularly, but not by way of
limitation, this invention relates to a security system for detecting unauthorized

intrusion into an individual unit as well as the detecting of a hazardous condition
existing in that individual unit and providing notification of such unauthorized

intrusion or hazardous condition.

Inventor R.J. Gaffigan (1989) discussed that some primary disadvantages
of the previously known home security systems is that there is no warning given
to the owner of a possible intruder presence. Also, the systems are prone to
false alarms; consequently, after a few false alarms, neighbors tend to ignore
subsequent alarms even though such alarms are not false alarms. Therefore,
the proponents want to develop a security system that the people can evaluate

so that to prevent or minimize the false alarms.

"POLYCLINIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
","Many clinics are still using paper usage to record all the i
medical records of a patient and manual system in other clinical activitioe The
purpose of this study Is to address the concern and solve related problems b
developing a Polyclinic Management System which aims to Support the clinic's
daily activities. This system involves all the clinic activities Starting from
registration to billing. The system is able to generate all clinic transactions such
as reports, doctor's prescription, patient's information and medical history
medicine inventory, consultations and billings. It also has queuing and
appointment system for patients to save their time, effort, and resources.

The methods used for this study include Feature Driven Development

design involves Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and Data Flow Diagram
(DFD) to show the logical flow for the system. For the implementation, Apache
is used as a web server, MySQL as a database, PHP Laravel as a scripting
language and Google Chrome as a browser.

Furthermore, the doctor, secretary and patients will give their evaluation
and also opinions to make the system more usable for the clinic’s daily activity.
Overall, this system is able to support the daily clinic operation based on
evaluation from real users and the system is able to perform the task correctly.
","Technology runs Our lives these days. Technology gets feasible in

practical terms and many people cannot imagine a life without it (D. Lamey,

2018). Technology involves information systems and it gives significance to any
businesses, because to have accurate information is much needed in
businesses. The need to have the technology as a tool for solving problems
and at the same time increasing the productivity and the quality of doing
business is also vital. Businesses today use information system and use the
available technologies because they understand the importance of maintaining

and updating data electronically (""A web-based integrated”, 2009).

However, resistance to change has been suggested as one of the factors
that has constrained the capability of healthcare organizations to improve
performance (""Identifying the sources of resistance to change"", 2017). As
noted, the inability of healthcare organizations to adapt to the changing
demands of highly competitive market is a barrier to their sustainability
(“Identifying the sources of resistance to change"", 2017). In addition, the pace
of healthcare change is accelerating, and will remain in this rapid state as the
sector continues to experience remarkable change resulting to market shifts
and the introduction of new technologies (""Identifying the sources of resistance
to change"", 2017). Moreover, health care must face the rapid development of
technology, competition, new business-like Organization structures and

thinking, strategic management, etc. (""Managing the information systems"",

2014).
To address the predicament, Information and Communication
Technology (ICT) should be engrafted in healthcare Organizations because
using information system for managing information in the health care such as
patient record, patient appointment system, patient scheduling appointment,
doctor schedule and medicine prescription is not only to save time or reduce
cost, but also a way to Support and improve the health care information to be
more accessible and flexible for system users and storing data efficiently.

Furthermore, it improves the quality of data control (""A web-based integrated”,

2009).

The challenge here is how information system can represent and
manage the entire data and information in the healthcare center such as patient
information, patient appointment, doctor’s schedule, payment and medicines.
Moreover, it is also a challenge on how an information system serves a way to

make healthcare organization attain efficiency, reliability and security relating

to healthcare services.

"ACLC DEPARTMENTAL EXAMINATION SCHEDULING SYSTEM
","The proposed ACLC Departmental Scheduling System was created
and designed to supply the needs of the client. The researchers gathered all
the data in order to develop a system which created schedules for the users
freed from hassle going to school just to look for their exam schedules.
Further saying this system is useful for the scheduler and also for the students
to determine their respected schedules. For the instructors, with their busy
schedules, they can save time looking for their exam schedule that they are

going to proctor.

The researchers aim to create an electronic system for departmental
examinations in ACLC Departmental Examination Scheduling System (ADES)
ACLC Butuan while the scheduler stands as an admin and the one who
creates the entire schedule for the departmental examination. The HR can
only view the schedule and indicate the time for the proctors. The instructor

and student can only view their schedule through the mobile app.

The researcher successfully created the system which really helps not

just for the students but also for the scheduler to view their exam schedules.

The researchers, therefore, concluded based on the testing phase that
on the student’s side, they fount out that the application is appropriate and
accessible to the students. On the other hand, teachers or instructors also
appreciated the function of the application, especially the viewing of the exam

schedules.

","1.1 Introduction

In a general educational timetabling problem, a set of events courses
and exams are assigned into a certain number of timeslots (time periods)
subject to a set of constraints, which often makes the problem very difficult to
solve in real-world circumstances. There are large numbers of commercial
software packages available to assist with the timetabling problem. However,
due to the variety of characteristic procedure and complexity of each
university in the scheduling process make the study in this research area still
interesting. In order to solve the best solution for this timetabling problem, a
wide research area has been studied in various complexity problems with

different algorithm solution
Nowadays, some of the institutions lacks the proponents to ease or
to handle things, and since technology is improving, as IT developers the role
is to help some of those institutions that have in need of an upgrade, unlike

the traditional method that has been used by the scheduler for a long time.

The researchers aim to create an electronic system for
departmental examinations in ACLC Departmental Examination Scheduling
System (ADES) ACLC Butuan. The system would lessen the workload on the
scheduler’s side, through the help of the proposed system, conflicts on
schedules will be minimized and be organized, instead of using the manual
way of generating schedules, the proposed system will provide easier tabling.
And if the (ADES) ACLC Departmental Examination Scheduling System is

implemented it will be a system unlike before from the old methods that the
scheduler have been using. For this system enables users to save time and

effort and do other tasks in their work.

"HERBAL PLANTS EXPERT SYSTEM CAPABLE OF DIAGNOSING

SKIN DISEASES OF THE HUMAN BODY
","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Herbal plants are used to cure certain diseases of the human body, thus,
it is said to be safe as it is natural. One of these are skin diseases, which are
the most common form of disease in humans. At this moment in time, there are
varieties of medicines that is concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of
skin diseases, which is the herbal medicine. Computers with human-level
intelligence like expert system has a great effect on people’s lives. This study
presents the herbal plants expert system capable of diagnosing skin diseases
of the human body which allow users to identify specific disease and to provide

treatment recommendations either what herbal plants to be used in curing the
disease. The study is limited only to the plants that are found in Butuan City
area and only to the skin diseases of the human body. The expert system use
Google Map API that corresponds the location of herbal plant in Butuan City.

The proponents was able to conclude that the expert system has an accuracy

of 60% in diagnosing a certain skin disease.
","Nowadays, people use Artificial Intelligence (Al) as a tool that has an
ability to solve problems and find better solution for a certain task. According to
Engelmore, Robert “an expert system is an Artificial Intelligence (Al) tool that is
derived from a branch of computer science. Al's scientific goal is to understand
intelligence by building computer programs that exhibit intelligent behavior.”
Technologies are affecting on how human live, work and entertain, Al is a
product of technology that is popular in terms of business industry such as Al
machines and it improves every day. Al and machine learning will be at the
center of initiatives to modernize agency systems and business processes,

driving the need to break down data silos. (Billy Sokol, 2017)

For thousands of years, herbalism for skin disorders has been used and those
medicinal plants are an important part of our natural wealth. According to the
World Health Organization (WHO), “traditional herbal medicine is naturally
occurring, plant-derived substances with minimal or no industrial processing
that have been used to treat illness within local or regional healing practices.”
Hence, herbal plants are an advantage when it comes to curing certain

diseases as for the purpose of sustaining and maintaining good health. Herbal
plants are affordable and it does not contain any drug that has an adverse

effect.

The Health centers manually diagnose skin diseases that makes the
process of diagnosing slow. Health Center representative recommends the
patients to a dermatologist. Skin diseases specialist is a dermatologist that's
costly and it takes time to set up a schedule for treatment. Immediate remedies
are needed to temporarily medicate the skin diseases, light skin allergies need
to be treated using herbal medicine. Some herbal plants are unusual and hard

to find and the instruction of using the herbal is necessary.

The solution of the stated problem is, to develop an application which is
the herbal plant expert system capable of diagnosing skin diseases of the
human body. The application will help the user identify specific common skin
diseases, in order to have the prescribe appropriate treatment that doesn't
require going to a dermatologist, it can easily recommend herbal medications,

gives an instruction on how to use the herbal and locate some herbal remedies

within Butuan City area.

Standard organization (ISO) 1926-1 software quality standard the mean was
used for computation in determining the system’s functionality, reliability,
accuracy, and security. The developed system provides a modernized and
efficient system for distributing keys. It was developed using iterative waterfall
development model techniques that employed top-down approach as a
Strategic method to the system development. The following were performed,
namely: data gathering procedures, requirement analysis, designing, coding,
testing and evaluation, and implementation. The system was found highly
functional, reliable, highly accurate, and highly secure with the total mean
obtained 4.21, 4.12,4.24, 4.39 respectively. The software quality of the system
developed a Key Dispenser with Face Recognition using Raspberry pi was
highly acceptable to the users based on the total mean obtained of 4.24. The
positive outcome recommendation for deployment of the developed system.
","4.1 Introduction

Currently, the world depends on technology and everyone from
young to old seems to be deeply involved. Technology has become
one of the most important elements in today’s societies and its role in
our lives keeps getting complex. According to N. Anusha, A. D. Sai and
B. Srikar (2017) Facial recognition is commonly used nowadays for
security purposes and also a very accurate way of verifying a user
when logging in. Raspberry pi 3 is a small complete computer that has
a microprocessor and other features required of a functional computer
such as keyboard, mouse, camera, and memory. A key dispenser is a
system that contains a key and distributes it in a well-organized way for
the employees. The proponents will develop a system that will
implement the aspects of raspberry pi, face recognition, and key
dispenser that will serve the company as well as the employees and

Staffs.

According to Renée Lynn Midrack (February 24, 2018) Facial
recognition technology is considered part of biometrics, the
measurement of biological data by devices or software, similar
to fingerprint scanning and eye/iris scanning systems. Computers use
facial recognition software to identify or verify a person by mapping
facial features, characteristics, and dimensions and comparing that

information with immense databases of faces. According to (/. Gupta,
V. Patil, C. Kadam and S. Dumbre, ""Face detection and
recognition using Raspberry Pi,"" 2016 IEEE International WIE
Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (WIECON-ECE),

Pune, 2016, pp. 83-86)

Face recognition has become one of the most important user
identification methods. According to Robert G. Spignesi Jr. Mark
Longley (2016) A system for dispensing a plurality of customized doses
of pharmaceuticals includes: a housing; a customized packaging
station configured to selectively package individual doses of medication
into customized packaging, and a controller connected to the customer

interaction station and the customized packaging station.

Companies today are still using manual process of distributing
keys for their rooms. What modern companies need nowadays is a
systematic way for this process. The old manual process will take time,
hassle and will delay the employee if the key is still in use and could
not identify who is using the key. Companies are still using a cabinet
where all the keys are placed, which may allow anyone to just get a
key easily even if it is not an authorized person. There are complains
that the keys are not placed and organized properly when returned to
the key holder. The person in-charge could not identify and could not

identify the last employee who used a key and will be a problem if it is

misplaced.

"SOLAR POWERED AUTOMATED DRYING RACK USING RASPBERRY PI
","ABSTRACT

This study is about the Solar Powered Automated Drying Rack Using
Raspberry Pi. The study is focused on developing a drying rack prototype that
would automatically hide and unhide due to rain instances. The researchers
anchored the study in Home Automation Systems Theory, thus, the study
provided two interfaces that would enable the users to automatically and
manually control the prototype. The study was conducted for the purpose of
finding a solution to the inconvenience that the raining probability gives

whenever clothes are hanged onto the drying rack in an open area. There is a
possibility that it might get wet if there is an unpredicted rain. Or, simply, no one
is around to take care of the clothes when it rains. The proponents of the study
aimed to develop a solar powered drying rack prototype that would
automatically and manually hide and unhide due to rainfall detection and
weather forecast from the internet. The newly developed system must be
evaluated in terms of functionality, reliability, efficiency and usability. By utilizing
the Waterfall Development Model Methodology, the prototype was improved,
developed and implemented into a hardware product that would benefit people
of different walks of life in a community who are too occupied to monitor their
clothes in the drying rack. In addition, it can be an efficient solution to the
inconvenience since the prototype is solar powered, hence, weather monitoring
and controlling of the drying rack can be carried out at any time of the day
without worrying about power interruption. The prototype used relevant
technologies such as Raspberry Pi 3, Rain Sensor Module and Servo Motor for
rainfall detection and mechanical control of the drying rack. In addition, the
prototype integrated mobile application to remotely control the drying rack. The
study has reached its purpose in developing a solar powered automated drying
rack prototype using raspberry pi. The researchers concluded that the
developed system is acceptable in accordance to the ISO/IEC 9126-1 Quality
Standard Model.

","1.1 Introduction

At present time, people have adapted to technological innovations in
carrying out their chores. The daily heavy workload and routines make it difficult
for people to manage their time (Rammohan et al., 2018). With existing and
evolving technologies nowadays, from machines to appliances and to
smartphones, people have resorted to conduct daily chores smartly and
electronically. These solutions for such tedious tasks make people of different
roles in the community comfortable and make them able to maximize their time.
Similarly, this study aims to provide solution to a certain task.

In the context of weather, it is impossible for it to be controlled. With this
facet condition, hanging washed clothes in the drying rack at open area would
be a person’s burden of raining probability (Rammohan et al., 2018). To ensure
the clothes in the drying rack from being wet without having to wait until it rains,
automation must be utilized. An automation system consists of a connection
between a hardware and software.

The development of Internet of Things (loT) indicates a change in the
accumulation of data. An increasing proportion of data collected today is
generated by sensors (Jyoti et al., 2016). These data generated from the
sensors are collected by microcontrollers that perform a wide variety of tasks.
The performance growth of microcontrollers has led their ability to manage
complex application. At the same time, there is a variety of manufacturers of
microcontrollers with many diverse types of processor and performance.

Raspberry Pi belongs to the most widely used microcontrollers (Martinez,
2016). The Raspberry Pi 3 has been chosen as a microcontroller in order to
gather information from the rain sensor module and mechanically control the
drying rack. A Raspberry Pi is a credit-sized computer that you can use to
program practical projects. The Raspberry Pi is mainly utilized due to its low
cost and small size and its performance is almost comparable to a normal
computer.

Thus, a microcontroller, rain sensor module, a mechanical motor and
solar power source is relevant for the development of the Solar Powered
Automated Drying Rack. A prototype that mechanically hides and un-hides the
drying rack in every rainfall detection. The rain sensor module provides the
parameter that the study is concerned about. Hence, the study aimed to provide

a solution to the problem concerning rain probabilities whenever there are

clothes hanged in the drying rack.

Furthermore, the doctor, secretary and patients will give their evaluation
and also opinions to make the system more usable for the clinic’s daily activity.
Overall, this system is able to support the daily clinic operation based on
evaluation from real users and the system is able to perform the task correctly.
","Technology runs our lives these days. Technology gets feasible in
practical terms and many people cannot imagine a life without it (D. Lamey,
2018). Technology involves information systems and it gives significance to any
businesses, because to have accurate information is much needed in
businesses. The need to have the technology as a tool for solving problems
and at the same time increasing the productivity and the quality of doing
business is also vital. Businesses today use information system and use the
available technologies because they understand the importance of maintaining

and updating data electronically (""A web-based integrated"", 2009).

However, resistance to change has been suggested as one of the factors
that has constrained the capability of healthcare organizations to improve
performance (""Identifying the sources of resistance to change"", 2017). As
noted, the inability of healthcare organizations to adapt to the changing
demands of highly competitive market is a barrier to their sustainability
(“Identifying the sources of resistance to change"", 2017). In addition, the pace
of healthcare change is accelerating, and will remain in this rapid state as the
sector continues to experience remarkable change resulting to market shifts
and the introduction of new technologies (""Identifying the sources of resistance
to change"", 2017). Moreover, health care must face the rapid development of
technology, competition, new business-like organization structures and

thinking, strategic management, etc. (""Managing the information systems"",

2014).
To address the predicament, Information and Communication
Technology (ICT) should be engrafted in healthcare organizations because
using information system for managing information in the health care such as
patient record, patient appointment system, patient scheduling appointment,
doctor schedule and medicine prescription is not only to save time or reduce
cost, but also a way to support and improve the health care information to be
more accessible and flexible for system users and storing data efficiently.
Furthermore, it improves the quality of data control (""A web-based integrated”,

2009).

The challenge here is how information system can represent and
manage the entire data and information in the healthcare center such as patient
information, patient appointment, doctor's schedule, payment and medicines.
Moreover, it is also a challenge on how an information system serves a way tc

make healthcare organization attain efficiency, reliability and security relating

to healthcare services.

1.1 Introduction

Libraries are the nucleus of a college (Arndt, 2016). They hum with social
and intellectual activity and are truly the center of leaming. They contain the
critical resources that make learning possible—books, journals, workstations,
printers, etc.—as well as skilled specialists who can help a student navigate a
research topic. The library is often the place students go to get down to
business; to reflect and process what they have learned in class. Nowadays,
students don’t even have to go to the library in order to benefit from its
resources. College libraries provide access to invaluable online resources, from

databases to electronic journals to tutorials.

According to Anderson (2015), there are trends in research libraries that
student visiting hours with library circulation data is way far from the number of
the past years, the number of students that visits the library is dropping. He
determined that every year 3.5% of the total student volume inside the library
is diminished. He also points out on his research that the amount of the
borrowed books every ear is diminished due to lack of students visiting the
public library. Also, he concluded that the volume of the students every year
would gradually drop every year if the lack of innovation in the library would

remain the same.

The proponents developed a system with an augmented reality feature
because it offers a technology available on mobile devices that allows users to
experience a layered, computer-generated enhancement to their real-world

perception. It blends digital components into the real world as a user becomes
2
immersed in an augmented view of reality. This technology uses mobile device

applications that display augmented media such as digital images, sounds,

graphics, and GPS data (Avila, 2017),

The proponents developed this kind of web-based and mobile application
to provide a more convenient and hassle-free system through the use of
Augmented Reality and a QR Code Scanner for every book that is presented
on the E-Library. It also provides great leverage for the library experience of the
students. The students can scan the QR Code of the certain book they want;
the Augmented Reality (AR) mode then display the books details, along with its
description, related books and bibliography. Students have the option whether

they want to download the pdf version of the book in their devices for offline

viewing.

INTRODUCTION

Introduction

Games are widespread phenomena and every one of us has
played a game at one point in our lives (Tupas, 2016). The mobile
technology boom in recent years has revolutionized the industry and
opened the doors to a new generation of gamers. The rea! revolution in
gaming came when LAN, and later the Internet, opened up multiplayer
gaming. Multiplayer gaming took the gaming community to a new level
because it allowed players to compete and interact using different
computers, which improved the social aspect of gaming (Chikhani,
2015). Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) are now major
international phenomena where people can play together (Webber,
2014). Offline multiplayer games can be played either through split-
screen or cross-platform, but both provide an enjoyable experience
with your friends.

Multiplayer games, where’ several persons interact
simultaneously over a network and receive a lot of interest. One of the
reasons is that competing with human counterparts is typically
considered as much more interesting and challenging than playing
against a computer (Wolf, 2017). Players create social bonds,
connections and a community through these shared experiences. it's
activated cities and engages people through social interaction
(Innocent, 2017). Mobile gaming is emerging with a highly competitive
industry, there are hundreds of games launched per day in the past two
years (Su, 2016). Android platform applications are the most dominant
technologies in the mobile markets and in 2016, 90% of Google Play's
revenue came from games (Hindy, 2017).

Players tend to play games on their own and forget to socialize
with other people outside their game and prefer to stay indoors playing
computer games. Some Filipino games are not well-known to the
millennials, they prefer playing online games and interact with people
on social media. They prefer playing games than to build a social
attachment to anyone outside the game. Playing Filipino games in this
generation ends up being boring and it doesn’t fit their expectations of
media and

games. People tend to socialize through social

communicate to them using their Android phone.
Games have a social benefit because gamers are able to

translate the social skills that they learn from co-playing or multiplayer
gameplay to have, according to Shapiro (2014), “peer and family
relations outside the gaming environment.” That’s why the proponents
would develop an Android game application entitled: KamayUtak that
involves Filipino games. The main goal of this study is to promote
Filipino games and advocate social interaction. This mobile multiplayer
game would make it possible for them to entertain and make bonds
with other players without using the Internet. Playing with other users
would not only boost their social skills but it will also give them

amusement by just playing the game.

used by other people. Hence, the researchers provided features that are not
available in other existing application such as finding the nearest restaurant
that is affordable for the user's budget and also having to choose what food
they like. With these features, the researchers believed that it could be a
benefit help for the users in order for them to have an easy access in finding

food shops.

To this end, the researchers conclude that the Food Shop Locator in
Butuan City using Mapping Application was achieved and it can be used for

1.1 Introduction

The food shop is a place where people pay to sit and eat meals
that are served on the premises. Butuan City is one of the places that
sells delicious seafood, it is also where families indulge their time in
enjoyment. Furthermore Butuan City has many natural attractions like
Agusan River and Mt. Mayapay. There are also man made attractions
like: Ramon Magsaysay bridge, Balangay Boats, Balangay Shrine
Museum, National Museum(Butuan City Branch), Guingona Park, Delta
Discovery Park and Bood Promontory Eco Park. Nowadays, there are
easy way to locate food shops by using an Android phone. Mapping
can locate and calculate distance which is useful for locating premises
and allow users to explore with a map, identify locations with custom
markers, augment the map data with image overlays, embed one ore
more maps as fragments and much more. Thus, the Information
Technology community has the idea to develop projects by using

mapping to locate certain premises such as a food shop.

Food is essential for sustaining human life, providing the
nutrients and calories that deliver the energy necessary for people to

go about their day to day activities(J. D’Acosta, 2015). Mobile
applications can be one of the best ways to keep consumers engaged
with a brand as they are on the move. With the increase in demand for
smartphones and efficiency of wireless networks, the demand for
mobile applications has increased incredibly (S.R. Parne, 2013). A
person needs a path finder application or the smart mobile applications
so that easy to track the location of the hotel and checkout the status

(A. Diwan et al., 2016).

Finding food shops like fast foods, restaurants, bakeries and
other food shops can be hard especially for tourists that aren’t even
familiar with the place. Travelers have to ask the local people for the
food shop which they want to go to and where to find it. They also want
to ask for other information like what food do they serve, and where is
the nearest food shop. This can be very problematic and frustrating
since they would get lost and waste time just trying to find the food

shop that they want.

The proponents then thought of developing an Android
application called “Food Shop Locator in Butuan City using mapping”
that will enable users to locate food shops using MapBox in Android
devices. The Android application should be able to search and locate

the nearest food shop and calculate the distance between the user and
the food shops with indications of how near or far the food shop is. The
user can also search by how much budget they have and specify food

categories, like for example seafood, barbecue and desserts to filter

out to where and what food shop they want to go.

1.1 Introduction

Throughout the 20th century, a balanced diet is a key to healthy
lifestyle that helps to maintain or improve overall health and provides the body
with essential nutrients that come from right foods. One of the main inventions
of the mobile phone industries was a camera in the phone, it comes handy
and can take pictures or videos at all time. The recent popularity of camera
equipped mobile phones has sparked a new field of use for scanning. Good
nutritional habits, balanced diet and healthful eating means a lifestyle of
making choices and decisions, planning, and knowing how to make quick and
wise choices when you haven't planned but learning to make sensible choices
from a confusing array of options is not easy nor aren't developed in one day.
A mobile solution to successfully assess nutrition facts that enables users to
choose from a wide variety of foods in the right proportions, consuming the
right amount of food and drink to obtain a healthy body weight much easier
and measure also analyze their food intakes. Nutrition information on food
labels is an important source of nutrition information but is typically

underutilized by consumers.

Miller LM, et al (2015). The Effects of Nutrition Knowledge on Food
Label Use: A Review of the Literature. Scanner technology experiments
tested the transferrable of a variety of different data from scanned organic
shapes CAD. A. Kus(2009). A comparative study of scanning in engineering,
product and transport design and fashion design education. Researcher from

ETH Zurich’s Computer Vision and Geometry Group transformed a
Smartphone into a portable digital scanner. ETH Zurich, Department of

computer science (n.d).

Majority of the people who want to eat healthy food for their diet don’t
know the nutritional values of the food item a person consumed. The majority
of the people also don't know the right amount of a particular food item to
consume. The researcher identified that without knowing the right amount a
person should consume, 4 person randomly consume food item without
limitation. Because of the lack of knowledge in the given situation, then mislay
their balanced diet; undergo a series of misconception of the food a person

eat.

The researcher used the standard nutritional value to have standard
nutritional facts of every food item. The researcher used the smart phone as
scanning device because it is small and can be hold with one hand; majority
of people own a smart phone. By the help of OpenCv that identifies the food
item, the researcher's solve the lack of knowledge of the respondents in terms
of nutritional facts of a particular food item. The researcher can have access

"TRAFFIC CONGESTION DETECTION WITH ALTERNATIVE PATH
RECOMMENDATION
","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Traffic Congestion Detection with Alternative Path Recommendation is
designed mainly to aid the private drivers in avoiding traffic with the use of its features

in providing real time traffic status and alternative path.

Through study, the researchers determined a number of existing applications
that have the same features and are already used by private drivers. Therefore,
researchers used the traditional transport and vehicular systems that used a V2V
communication, in which data are reliant to the users. Thus, the researchers provided
a feature that is not available to any existing application such as using a CCTV to
provide a real time traffic status and an alternative path. With these features, the
researchers believed that it could really be a good help to private drivers in order to
easily check the traffic status of a specific road, avoid traffic, and shift to routes with

less traffic congestion.

To end, the researchers therefore concluded that the Traffic Congestion
Detection with Alternative Path Recommendation was able to achieve the objectives

and it can be used for future application purposes.
","Chapter 1

1.1 Introduction

Nowadays, application is used to provide access for road status. The
increase of transportation in society causes many problems. Such annual
economic loss caused by traffic congestion. Cities showed a large increase in

road traffic which leads to deterioration in capacity and disorganized traffic

system.

In Metro Manila the heavy traffic is due to many factors such as the over
population of residents, congestion of private vehicles, inefficient services of rail
transportation, and the ineffective traffic control management in the country’s
capital region (Rig Man, 2015). Traffic congestion in Butuan City is now apparent
due to the rapid increase of growth rate, that as of 2007 the number of
population is 298,378 while in 2015 was only 337,063 people. (census.gov.ph,
2016). A total of 81,901 licensed private cars, excluding the pending plastic
license plate from August 2015 to January 2017, the inadequacy of transit
options is the obstacle that causes blockage and merger. Double parking, road

works, and narrow roads also caused traffic in Butuan City.

A real time monitoring of traffic information is obtainable with the help of
CCTV camera. A simple image processing on the frames to estimate traffic

density based on analysis of traffic images from live traffic feed that can identify
traffic status. The researchers used a customized Haar Classifier in OpenCV to

detect and count the number of cars recognize by the CCTV.

Thus, identifying traffic status is relevant for the development of Traffic

Congestion Detection with Alternative Path Recommendation (TCD-APR). An

application designed to detect the real-time State of traffic congestion that

allows user to search desired destination and to Provide an alternative path.
The advance GPS can mitigate this by finding less congested routes. Hence,

the study aims to lessen the traffic congestion, and provide alternative path to

improve the economic development in Butuan City.

Introduction

Planning a wedding is composed of different areas of duty that would

require more time to deal with it. There are so many things to put into a

wedding, and efficient planning is very important. According to (ACS Distance

Education), a wedding is a very stressful time for most people. So even
though it is a joyous occasion, there is still a lot of stress involved because of
all the organization and planning required. A lot of decisions needs to be

made by the couple and their families to ensure that the went is a momentous

period in their lives.

Decision Support System or DSS is a computer based system that
integrate data sources with modeling and ranking alternatives for decision
management. An example of an existing system from (Dipak, 2015) entitled
PHP Project Online Planner. This project is useful for online customer for
booking and planning their wedding online. The existing systems of wedding
planner are related to the proponent's projects that provides planning

management or DSS system.

That is why it is very important that both of them must communicate on
planning their wedding day. From the cakes, invitations, entourage, reception,
catering, type of wedding, souvenirs, photographer, videographer, hair and
make-up. However some couple choose to rely their wedding preparations

through hiring a wedding planner for a reason that they wanted to rush their
wedding and maybe for a reason that they lack time with the preparation and
planning. But hiring a wedding planner has disadvantages such as time
consuming in terms of communicating with one other. Also it needs a

separate financial budget for the wedding preparation.

In order to conquer this common situation when using manual process,
the proponents came up to a solution by providing an android application
which can help the customers to decide for their preferences. The application

"SURIGAO DEL NORTE TOURIST GUIDE APPLICATION
WITH MAPPING
","Executive Summary

This study is conducted in order to help tourists to have an easy access
in finding tourist spots within Surigao Del Norte. For the past years, Surigao
Del Norte doesn’t have its own tourist guide application so the researchers

sought ways to create a tourist guide application exclusively in Surigao Del

Norte that can help to boost their tourism industry.

The application would locate all the tourist destination in Surigao del
Norte which includes the nature parks, landscapes and seascapes, island
adventure, religious and cultural heritage, city tours, accommodations and
other outdoor adventure such as mountain trekking and caving. Surigao Del

Norte Tourist guide with mapping also shows the description of tourist spots.

To successfully develop the Surigao del Norte Tourist Guide Application
with Mapping, the proponents need to meet the tool requirements such as
Google Maps API that allows in displaying maps in the application since the
main part of the project is about mapping, java programming language, XML,
Command Prompt (CMD), Android Studio, Firebase, XAMPP, Sublime,
android phones or tablet where an APK is installed to test and run the
application, an internet connection which helps the proponents browse over
the internet about the related studies of the application, and laptop or

computer where the entire application is being developed, coded and build.

1.1 Introduction

Surigao del Norte is a formation of group of islands at the rim of the Asian
continental shelf and is located at the northeastern part of Mindanao, Region
XII, CARAGA, according to their tourism’s website. The province is composed
of 21 municipalities, 449 puroks and 54 barangays which is politically divided
into two congressional districts. District | comprises the islands of Siargao and
Bucas Grande that has 9 municipalities. District !I includes Surigao City, the
provincial capital, and 12 mainland municipalities. And ithas an area of 288,905
hectares of 2,740.14 square kilometers which is roughly equivalent to 9.67
percent of the total land area of Northern Mindanao, as stated at the Surigao

del Norte’s website.

This province is popular not only to the Filipinos but also one of the best
tourists’ destination among foreign people for it is blessed with its rich
environment. According to tripadvisor Philippines, Surigao del Norte Province
has 8,045 reviews and opinions as evidence that there are many tourists love
to visit the place to experience its amazing discoveries. It is a place where many
types of attractions are found specifically its nature parks, landscapes and
island adventure, religious and cultural heritage, city tours,

seascapes,

accommodations and other outdoor adventure such as mountain trekking and

caving. There are most visited islands in Surigao that is like a paradise for its

famous, long stretch of sugar-fine beaches, perfect surfs, vast mangrove forest,
and deep waters teeming with a plethora of marine life. Furthermore, enhancing
caves, magnificent rock formations and mountain lakes provides a perfect
ambience for the thrill seeker and highly-strong individuals. Thus, it is called a
Shangri-La for adventurers where beautiful places are found and a tropical gem

that has managed to preserve its beauty through the years.

Surigao del Norte is known for its amazing environment features that tourists
seeks adventures, but unfortunately, the proponents found out that it has lack
of direction guidance that would be beneficial for those who are new to the
place. In other words, there is no existing system or application that Surigao
has that can help tourists being guided along its way to their destination.
Therefore, the proponents prompted to innovate an application entitled Surigao
del Norte Tourist Guide Application with Mapping, that will help all the tourists
in Surigao del Norte to have a guide on the direction on what places they

wanted to go.

"AGUSAN RIVER FLOOD MONITORING USING RASPBERRY PI WITH
SMS ADVISORY
","ABSTRACT

Agusan River Flood Monitoring using Raspberry Pi with SMS Advisory
has been developed to give warning and to help the residents of the affected
barangays because Butuan City was prone to flooding during rainy season.
This study focuses only on the water level detection and early warning system
(via SMS) that alerts affected residents for a potential flood event and give the
address of the nearest evacuation center in their area. Furthermore, inquiry
was also included in this study to become more interactive wherein individuals
in the community could inquire the actual water level status and the residents
can also turn on and off the SMS notification alert through SMS keyword.
Using System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as a method in making the
software was very useful and helpful in identifying errors during the
development. The following technologies like Raspberry Pi 3 B+, Ultrasonic
Sensor, and GSM are used in making the prototype. The proponent
conducted a survey for the software quality of the system to the affected
barangay and was highly acceptable based on the total mean obtained of
452. The software was indeed useful to the residents who live in the flood
prone area because it helps them evacuate early before the situation get
worst. This eliminates the manual way of detecting the water level of the flood
and late receiving of SMS warning of the residents. it was relevant and
important as per needs for safety and welfare of the community.
","CHAPTER |
INTRODUCTION

1.1 Introduction

Agusan River Basin was known as the third largest river basin of the
Philippines. According to the Butuan City Disaster Risk Reduction and
Management office (CDORRMO) they can predict the water level of Agusan
River manually, by means of communicating with the affected barangay for an
update of their situation. Also the CDRRMO said that they only knew if a
barangay was already affected by the flood once they receive a call from that
barangay. After receiving any updates from the affected barangay they would
contact the Philippine Information Agency (PIA) to send warnings and alerts to
the people who live in the affected barangay. But according to Hon. Jullieto D.
Llagas chairman of barangay Poyohon they don’t have any connection with
CDRRMO they do things by their own during a flood. Based on this matter the
proponents decided to conduct a research and studies which leads them to
create the Agusan River Flood Monitoring using Raspberry Pi with SMS
Advisory.

Flooding has always resulting in enormous anxiety on countries across
the continent where by lost of life’s, people displaced, agricultural land
submerged in mud’s, roads, bridges and houses washed away (Suchita2014).
Although flooding was an abnormal phenomena agers ago, but now it was
considered a life treating natural disaster for the mankind (Siva, 2013). Over
the last 25 years Flood Early Warning System (FEWS) has been developed to
numerous rivers in the world (Vermeulen et al; 2014). Several expert have

studies over the years on ways to improve flood control, thereby reducing risk
(Tomaszkiewicz, 2013).

The Agusan Rivers water level has been monitored and it has a
corresponding evacuation protocol for the people who live in the affected
area. Flood Alert level1 means that all residents of the affected barangay has
been alerted for them to be aware of the situation and danger. Flood Alert
Level 2 means that the vulnerable sector composed of elderly, children,
pregnant women, lactating mother and person with disabilities (PVVDS) to be
Pre-Emptively Evacuated. Flood Alert Level 3 means that the barangay
Officials, PNP, BFP must order residents of the affected barangay to evacuate
and proceed to Evacuation Center. But the BCDRRMO has difficulty of giving
warning to the people who live in the affected area in advance time because
they just wait for the Barangay official to contact them to report the situation
when the flood was already happening.

Therefore, the proponent decided to develop Agusan River Flood
Monitoring using Raspberry pi with SMS Advisory to give warning and help to
the residents of the affected barangays. If the water level of Agusan River
arises the system would automatically send an SMS __ to the residents of the
affected barangays containing the water level of the Agusan River together
with the location of the evacuation center. The system also provides
automatic reply to the residents of Butuan City, if they have any inquiries

regarding with the water level status of the Agusan River during rainy days.

INTRODUCTION

In this chapter are the rationale of the study, project context, purpose

and description, objectives of the study, scope and limitation.
4.1 Rationale of the Study |

Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) was
established through the enactment of Republic Act. No. 7796, empowers
TESDA to establish and maintain a system of accrediting, coordinating,
integrating, monitoring and evaluating formal and non-formal technical
vocational education and training programs. The National Certificate, is an
important document needed to present in applying jobs here and abroad, it is
a graduate’s proof that her or she has passed all the trainings and

requirements set by the TESDA.

The TESDA Director Guiling Mamondiong in the year 2017 said that they
conducted inspection of training centers and they found out that sometimes
they are just sending their substitutes to train the students. Aside from that,
the assessors and trainers are being pirated by other departments. Based on
this matter the proponents decided to conduct a research and studies which
leads them to create the An Implementation of TESDA Competency-Based

Training Delivery Transaction Management System.

The training of TESDA has been managed and they conducted a

registration for the trainees and trainers. The trainers can monitor his or her
tframees all the time but they cannot monitor on time which of those trainees

are behind and need of their attention.

Therefore, the proponents’ decided to develop An Implementation of
If SDA Competency-Based Training Delivery Transaction Management
System to give them an easy way to manage their trainers and trainees. They
can managed who ts that trainee that have been left behind and what part of
the Unit Competency (UC) were they consumed so much time. The system
can auto generate the other works of the trainers like checking directly the

+

achevement charts and the progress chart instead of manual.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study
Most of aquaculture industries, manual water monitoring has been
employed, the aquaculture farms normally perform their daily physical
monitoring on fishponds. The fisherman needs to manually observe the water
condition of the fishpond, this activity is time consuming and it lacks automated
alert system for the fisherman. Agusan River Basin was in the northeastern part
of Mindanao that passes mainly through three provinces in Region X\ and
Caraga. When the rainy season comes, Agusan River would be filled with water
and would overflow in which it can affect their fishponds in Agusan del Norte.
According to Escobido J. et al. (2019, September 15) the fisher folks of Agusan
del Norte can predict the water level of Agusan del Norte, by means of the
predictions of high tide, low tide of the calendar, however, in terms of monitoring
the water level on their prediction is not always accurate because when there
is a heavy rain the water level arises and cause overflowing and bursting to
open dike of the fishponds. Also, fisher folks manually check the water quality
of the fishpond and can't assure that the water is not polluted because when
there is a heavy rain the water from the polluted area will go straight to the
fishponds and pollutes the area. By then, they will monitor the fishpond water
quality by checking manually the entire fishpond if there are dead fishes or
prawns floating in the said area and lead their conclusion that the water of the
fishpond is polluted. As mentioned by Kayalvizhi et al. (2015), the problem also

related to the requirement of manpower to perform manual activities and need

to be minimized, the proponents also developed a monitoring system. Based
on this matter, the proponents decided to conduct research and studies which
leads them to create a system for monitoring fishpond with notification
component.

Therefore, the proponents decided to develop a system for monitoring
fish pond with notification component that would frequently monitored in the
water level of the fishpond and give warnings when the water level arises using
different kinds of sensors and to develop a system that store and retrieve data.
If the water level of the fishpond arises to its standard level, the system would
automatically send an SMS to the fisherman containing the water level of the
fishpond, temperature and its pH level. Through this, it would be useful to
observe the water level and monitor water parameters; temperature, pH, and

the water level if it is well-balanced in order to ensure the fish health, growth

and survival.

"A MICRO CONTROLLER-BASED PEDESTRIAN LANE RECOGNITION

SYSTEM THROUGH IMAGE PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY WITH VEHICULAR
MOTION CONTROL
","ABSTRACT

Pedestrian road crossings have become a major issue in road
accidents, especially in urban areas where the issue of contro! exists. To
improve the mobility between the drivers and the cross walkers, a pedestrian
lane recognition system is necessary. Pedestrian awareness is essential for
improving road safety. Hence, the proponents came up with the idea of
pedestrian recognition system aimed to recognize the presence of pedestrian
lane and automatically performs motion control to stop whenever an obstacle
or a person crossing is detected. The purpose of this report is to provide an
overview of research studies on pedestrian safety. Raspberry Pi camera
module using the method of color thresholding is used for image processing
and classifying image as pedestrian lane or not. This identifies two-
dimensional images using RGB color model that will recognize the color
preferred by the user in the camera recognition and ultrasonic sensor. The
proponents made an analysis of the peculiarities of the task of surveillance for
pedestrian crossings and presented a pedestrian recognition system. A
thorough investigation was performed on a test image in order to validate the
system's effectiveness. The efficiency of the system is affected by real-time
processing and the error rate of recognition. In general, the system helps the

people and the drivers to cross pedestrian lane in a well-organized and more
secure way.

INTRODUCTION

1.4 Rationale of the Study
Pedestrian detection has been a focus of recent research due to its
importance for practical applications such as automotive safety and visual
surveillance. The essential role of machine vision modules to realize active
safety systems for accident prevention is clearly established in academic
research and is also reflected in innovative systems introduced by industry
(K. Sri, K. Aditya, 2013). It has driven the importance of having pedestrian
lane recognition as part of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)
that are developed to automate, adapt, and enhance vehicle systems for
safety and better driving. With the progress of urbanization, there has
been a great increase in urban population density and __ traffic
infrastructures. Pedestrian crossing, as an important part of transportation
infrastructures, serves to secure pedestrians’ lives and possessions and
keep traffic flow in order (Pedestrian Lane, 2016).

As a part of important efforts in safety precautions to prevent road
traffic injuries, vehicular collisions and like other road traffic crashes,
pedestrian lane is a road infrastructure set as an indicator to the drivers to
slow down or to reduce its speed and volume (Visually Separated
Pedestrian Lane, 2009). In terms of quantifying the accident rate
depending on the type of transportation, pedestrians, who account for 41%
of the total number of victims, represent the largest number of traffic

accident victims in terms of deaths. It is well known that human errors are
the causes of most traffic accidents. The two main errors are drivers’
inattention and wrong driving decisions (Basam Musleh, 2010).

In the evident side along the pedestrian accidents, it initiates the
problem that every public commuter experience. From 2005 up to August
14, 2015, there were 57,877 people of whom 1,859 or 3.2% were killed,
while 56,018 or 96.7% were injured relating to the misuse of pedestrians
in Metro Manila roads. This could be translated that every pedestrian
causes one casualty and 30 injuries. A pedestrian is defined as a person
who is travelling on foot and not riding a vehicle (Thinking Machines Data
Science Inc. , 2015). Driver attitude is a main key risk. Driver behavior
particularly in terms of respect for other road users was expressed by
those surveyed while drinking and driving is cited by the World Health

Organization.

This leads the proponents to come up with a study on a micro
controller-based pedestrian lane recognition system through image
processing technology with vehicular motion control. It is a real-time
pedestrian recognition incorporating the concept of a pedestrian lane

detection system embedding image processing technology for vehicular

motion control.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study
Bus is a means of transportation for short or long distance travelled.
Public busses are most common transportation for mass commuters.
According to Tavilla (Tavilla, 2015) Many commuters travel daily on multiple
modes of mass transit operated by different agencies with separate fare
collection systems that enables fare payments and trip planning across
regional transit systems and transportation. Therefore, bus is very important
for any commuters. Today, the means of payment specially on travelling are
in cash. According to Garcia et.al.,(Garcia, 2006) Monetary bills have been
launched into trade markets, and became one of the modes of payment up
to present. This means that it signifies the importance of cash especially
when you are on travel, riding buses or any kind of public vehicle.
According to John Belda (John Belda et al., 2015) Public utility
buses in the Philippines used one methods of payment process. The manual
payment method, in which the conductor uses puncher to release tickets for
the passenger. The significance of cash payment on buses holds some
issues and problems. According to Crisobal et.al., (Cristobal, 2018). Public
utility buses are the most commonly used vehicle in a long distance journey
passing through provincial and national roads. Problems in bus transactions
are being encountered. Usually, the passengers do not have exact amount
in paying bus fares and the conductors"" method of collection is time-

consuming. As money has been invented, fraud and volume payment
became an issue. It is also supported by the statement of John Belda, M. M
et.al.,(John Belda et al., 2015) Commonly mass of people used public
vehicle for it can travel in a much longer distance than any other
transportation vehicles using money that serves as payment.
Aside of money issues, giving money change is time-consuming.
Some bus operators tend to calculate the amount of fare with the given
kilometer and sometimes, inaccurate. Passengers have an exact amount of
money to pay for the bus fare and what they have to do is to wait for the
conductors change. According to Tirachini (Tirachini, 2013). Using the
estimated boarding and alighting average times, performance comparisons
are simulated assuming a service with payment outside buses validation
inside buses and cash transactions. In particular, that substantial time
savings are accruable if payment methods are upgraded from slow
techniques, such as cash transactions to the fastest while intermediate
technologies such as prepaid cards validated inside buses fall in between.
Therefore, the researchers come up with the idea of enhancing the
methods of paying fares in the bus by using an Android device and an
electronic QR code reading device which will be used by the conductors to
accumulate the passenger’s fares. This payment method will be used both
the QR code reading device and Android technology. According to Crisobal
et.al., (Cristobal, 2018) Cashless transaction is one where the payment is
made by means other than physical cash. (Gupta, 2017) The rise of cashless
transaction is due to emerging trends driven by consumer's preference,
convenience and efficiency in transacting. (Ahmed, 2016) The concept of

cashless transaction system emerged in the nineteenth century.

","ABSTRACT

Water Level and Wind Intensity Identification using Microcontroller with
Message Notification Service for Alarm and Waming System has been
developed to give waming and to help the residents of the affected puroks
because Butuan City was prone to flooding and wind storm during rainy and
windy seasons. This study focuses only on the water level detection and wind
intensity and early warning system (via SMS) that alerts affected residents for
a potential flood and wind event and give status through to the facebook
notifications. Furthermore, inquiry was also included in this study to become
more interactive wherein individuals in the community could inquire the actual
water level status and wind status where residents can also turn on and off the
SMS notification alert through SMS keyword. Using System Development Life
Cycle (SDLC) as a method in making the hardware was very useful and helpful
in identifying errors during the development. The following technologies like
Arduino Uno, Ultrasonic Sensor, Anemometer, Sim900 GSM and Network
Booster are used in making the prototype. The proponents conducted a survey
for the hardware quality of the system to the affected puroks and was highly
acceptable based on the total mean obtained of 4.52. The software was indeed
useful to the residents who live in the flood prone area because it helps them
evacuate early before the situation get worst. This eliminates the manual way
of detecting the water level of the flood and wind intensity of the wind storm and
late receiving of SMS warning of the residents. It was relevant and important as
per needs for safety and welfare of the community. The keywords are ‘water

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

Philippines is located above the equator. It lies along the Western Pacific
basin which is considered the world's busiest typhoon belt. Over the past years,
typhoon is getting stronger and it affects people’s daily lives. It is also the very
reason why it is essential for us to determine what will be the weather for the
next couple of hours. It also plays a vital role in disaster risk reduction and
mitigation (Mercado,2018). The changing properties of losses due to
occurrences of droughts, floods and typhoon disasters a comparatively
economically prosperous in province. Influences of typhoon activities on
droughts and floods are also analyzed. Results based on extensive and
thorough investigations indicate that generally, province is both humid and
warm. However, in recent decades, the negative impacts of droughts seem to
be enhancing, which is proved by increasing drought-induced economic loss

(Zhang et.al, 2010).

The Butuan City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office
(CDRRMO) stated that there are three colors that represent the flood alert level.
First, the color yellow which represents as flood alert level 1 in which it means
that flood and wind are possible. Second, color orange that represents as flood
alert level 2 it signifies Pre-Emptive Evacuation Phase. Third and last is the
color red which represents as flood alert level 3 that signifies Force Evacuation.
The mentioned above are included in the Water Level and Wind Intensity

Protocol, but it is not enough to monitor and help the people living in the affected
area during the flood and wind calamity. People are actually practicing the
dissemination of information status of the water level and wind intensity, but in
the real scenario the messages and information are always late. Once they
receive the messages, the flood and wind are already affecting them and they
already experience difficulty of evacuating.

The Department of Science and Technology Philippine Atmospheric,

Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (DOST-PAGASA)
stated that there are five Public Storm Warning Signal (PSWS) that represents
the wind kilometer per hour (kph). First, PSWS #1 represents as 50-61kph in
which it is expected in 36hrs on 4% issuance it indicates moderate gale to high
risk structure. Second, PSWS #2 represents as 62-74kph itis expected in 24hrs
on 1° issuance it signifies fresh gale to high risk structures. Third, PSWS #3
represents as 75-88kph it is expected in 18hrs on 4st issuance it indicates strong
gale to high risk structures. Fourth, PSWS #4 represents as 89-102kph it is
expected in 12hrs on 45 issuance it signifies storm to high risk structures. Fifth,
PSWS #5 represents as more than 103-117kph also expected in 12hrs on 4%
issuance it indicates violent storm to high risk structures.

The proponents found out that the indications mentioned above are not
enough to satisfy the people’s need when it comes to their safety in times of
disasters. They are also worried especially that it includes the lives of their
families and relatives. For this reason, they wanted to achieve a better way of
improving the present condition by creating a prototype device called “Water

Level and Wind Intensity Identification using Microcontroller with Message

Notification Service for Alarm and Warning System”.

1.1 Background of the Study
The covid-19 is a pandemic disease that exploded at the end of 201% and
the beginning of 2020, Based on WHO (World Health Organization) statement,
the virus has now spread to over 20 countries and territories worldwide. The
covid19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the
nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes. A novel strain of coronavirus

was rst detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, a city in China.

In these days of an outbreak, many have studied contact tracing to

prevent the spreading of COVID-19; for this reason, the contact tracing has been
presented using smartphones, Bluetooth connectivity, or GPS location history of
performing the contact tracing. Also, developing a BubbleBox system composed
of a wearable device, a wristband, to Under the protected social gap between the

person who wears it and other people, trace all contacts. The wristband is

responsible for outlining the connections- it generates a unique id.

However, The DOH (Department of Health) 13 (CARAGA) has conrmed
local transmission of the coronavirus disease 2019 after reporting new infections
in Butuan City. Due to these developments, Local Government Units (LGUs)
Strictly implement the health protocols to contain the spread of Covid-19. To
reduce the chance of propagation of the 2019-NCOV, the city government of

Butuan has issued a new color-coding scheme to control the movement of

people. The color-coding quarantine pass, residents carrying black colored
quarantine passes can go out only on Monday and Tuesday Residents vath
Blue quarantine passes can only go out on Tuesday and Friday At the same
time, those with Red quarantine passes can go out on Wednesday and Saturday
to buy basic needs. Senior citizens, PWD, and pregnant women may go out on
Sunday. Front liners with their quarantine passes are exempted in the
colorcoding scheme. Implementing quarantine passes in a piece of paper is not
enough to control the spreading of coronavirus. Based on this matter, the
proponents decided to conduct research and studies, which leads them to create
a system application for monitoring local residence accessing to establishments
as an aid for contact tracing and data analytics.

Therefore, the proponents decided to develop a system application for
monitoring residents accessing establishments to aid contact tracing and data
analytics to watch those people going inside the shopping malls, barangay, and
any other establishments using IDs that have QR codes. Instead of using a piece
of paper, the old quarantine passes replace an ID with a QR code. Residents will
be trace by those codes and quickly contact those exposed in the area where
there are positive cases. Through this, we can control the people going in and
out in our barangays and city. We know that the COVID-19 pandemic has spread
like wildre across the world. Few countries manage to keep it well-control. To

prevent the spread of virus infections, we will build a system to control its spread.

INTRODUCTION

4.1 Rationale of the study

Credit is a very important product in banking and financial institutions.
There is always a customer in need of a loan. Since Loans are always
accompanied by risks, it is important to identify suitable applicants, and there
have to be a means to determine and separate the good applicants from the
bad. To solve this issue, financial institutions such as banks started
developing credit scores. Using the customer's credit scores lenders can
define the risk of loan applicants. By calculating the credit score, lenders can
make a decision as to who gets credit, would the person be able to pay off the
loan and what percentage of credit or loan they can get (Lyn C. Thomas,

David B. Edelman and Jonathan N. Crook 2002).

Credit Reporting is one of the most important institutions in modern
financial system how credit reporting works in the financial system around the
world, to provide empirical evidence of the value of credit reporting data for
credit analysis, and to identify appropriate public policy recommendation.
Credit records such as a previous loan of a person performance tool to predict
his or her future behavior. And also, Credit scoring is used by the lenders from
different company and institution to help decide on whether to extend or deny
credit of their borrowers. One of the most important kits, to classify a bank
customers, as a part of the credit evaluation process to reduce the current
and the expected risk of a customer being bad credit, is credit scoring. (Hand

& Jacka, 1998, p. 106)
According to Janice Jardio an employee of Macondray Finance
Corporation one of the small lending company in Butuan city to have an
access of the borrowers credit information they do background checking of
the client personal information. By that, the lending company have the basis if
they can assure to lend money to clients. They said that in terms of sharing
information to other lending company they cannot easily give the information
of the clients if the other lending company wants to know the information of
the borrower. In addition, the lending company can share information but
limited only because of competition and for the sake of the clients data
privacy. According also to one of the employee of QCredit Corporation that
the data are centralized, the information was shared only to the different
branches of QCredit Corporation. Moreover, on getting information about the
borrowers, the lending company needs more background information
checking or so-called customer intelligence (Cl) to determine if the borrowers
of the lending company can manage the loan payments.

The use of credit records and related decision tools, such as credit
scoring can also facilitate the supervision of financial institutions by providing
standard and objective criteria for credit analysis.

Therefore, the proponents decided to develop A Web Portal Application
for Accessing Micro Credit Records to help the lending company to have
access to the borrowers previous credit records with the credit scores. Also
with this study, the lenders may obtain borrowers credit records to know how
borrowers manage financial responsibilities and to help lenders decide
whether to lend the borrowers or not. Also, to know the other lending
companies where the borrowers have a previous credit, with the credit score
the lenders can evaluate the borrowers creditworthiness to make lending

decision.

INTRODUCTION
1.1 Rationale of the Study

In early 2020, after a December 2019 outbreak in China, the

World Health Organization identified SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 of the genus Befacoronavirus) as a
new type of coronavirus. It can affect the upper respiratory tract (sinuses,
nose, and throat) or lower respiratory tract. It is deadly and now spreads
the same way that other coronaviruses do, mainly through person-to-
Person contact. This pandemic severely affects many countries and
causes problems to mankind. The potential long-term consequences of
the pandemic could have for us are Starting to reveal themselves in the
people's daily lives. Schooling becomes online to avoid person to person
contact, establishments that sell necessities are controlled to Operate,
which affects the economy and decreases workforce, travelers, and
commuters. They need to undergo checkpoints to ensure that
requirements to pass border to border are implemented and met.
Scientists said the coronavirus is like a droplet and is not airborne (China
Daily via Reuters, 2020), According to the World Health Organization,
coronaviruses, including preliminary information on the COVID-1 9 virus,
may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. On the
other hand, one of the most effective ways to fight the coronavirus's
spread is to disinfect the positively touched surfaces and parts of the

body. Public-health experts think that mass disinfection efforts will have
mixed effectiveness in outbreak zones. One of our locality’s focus is to
disinfect people passing through cross borders to prevent the spread of
the virus from communities. That is why every cross-border control
makes sure to facilitate disinfection for commuters and travelers in every
boundary to avoid local transmission. However, problems still occur in
doing the manual process of sanitizing people passing through borders.
Instances like remains of the virus droplets can stick on bottles of the
hand sanitizers and travel assessment checklist provided by the cross-
border control unit. The travel assessment checklist is required to survey
the passers crossing the border control’s condition and connection,
serving as a record for contact tracing. According to Greiner A. et al.
(2015), because the travel assessment checklist is done manually
through a piece of paper, it causes delay and ineffectiveness of contact
tracing, contributing to the extensive transmission of diseases.
Challenges have been evident in every step of the contact tracing
process from implementation to management, including identifying,
locating, enrolling contact-persons and, managing personnel, and
ensuring contact tracing performance. A paper data questionnaire could
also be a source of virus transmission. Though some are now using a
UV light for eliminating the virus, the process is still a hassle and time
consuming to the people crossing the borders. Therefore, the
proponents decided to develop the Sanitation and Disinfection System
for Cross Border Control with Data Collection Facility as an Aid for
Contact Tracing that would automate the disinfection and sanitation

process on cross border controls that need no direct person to person
interaction and records information from people passing through the
borders as an aid for contact tracing. This study starts from the collection
of the data of a person who will pass through the border control by
scanning the QR ID provided by the local government unit, and the
system prototype will automatically record the passer’s information into
the database. And the travelers will also answer the travel assessment
checklist that is already translated into English, Tagalog, and Cebuano,
answerable either “YES/NO,” OO/HINDI,” OO/WALA presented on a
monitor visible to the passer. After that, the passer is now ready to enter
the proposed cabin prototype for the disinfection process through a mist
sanitizer. Through this study, we can make sure that the sanitation and
disinfection of every person who crosses the border control are correctly
implemented in no need for a person to person direct contact. Contact
tracing would also be comfortable, accurate, and safe because the data
that the database will gather will be accessible at any point needed.
Moreover, this system will aid the government's work for the public
preventive measures for the citizens' safety and the prevention of

COVID-19 transmission.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

In most cities of the country, there are stray dogs in every area. The
cause of these are owners who are just letting them roam free. These strays
can thrive as long as the conditions are met, which are food from garbage and
the abundance of a mate through other strays. This activity can lead to an
exponential growth of the stray dog population. Unvaccinated dogs may lead
to problems if left unchecked, such as the rapid spread of rabies accidents,
which is mostly caused by stray's aggressive behavior towards the populace.

According to.

Republic Act (RA) 9482, known as the Anti-Rabies Act of 2007, the law
also states that a stray dog can be impounded if it is found that it has no
owner for the safety of bystanders. This law was made in line with the policy

of the State to establish responsible pet ownership.

With regards to making sure that dog owners will be responsible for
their pets at the same time, RA 9482 states that both the dog owner and even
the local government units had been mandated to be responsible for caring
for dogs. According to Section 5 (c) of this law, to avoid accidents from
happening, it is the responsibility of the pet owners to maintain control over

their dogs and not to allow them to roam the streets or any public place

without a leash.

While local government units (LGUs) are responsible for making sure

that dogs are leashed or confined within the premises of a dog owner's house
or fenced surroundings(Section 7,(3), Ibid.), the LGUs were strictly
responsible for enforcing dog impounding and field control of controlling stray

dog population (Section 7(2), Id.).

A dog can be considered as a stray dog, leaving the owner's house and
walking without any evidence that it has an owner like a collar or leash
(Section 3(p), Id.) Therefore, The personnel decided to develop a system for a
device that may be of service of assisting on the detainment of these potential
hazards to the people by the implementation of automated cages that would
ensure a safe detainment of the animal whilst ensuring, in turn, it cannot harm

the agents that are assigned for said detainment unit while the potentially

dangerous animal is retrieved and impounded.

14.1. The Rationale of the Study

Nowadays, universities and educational institutions are under pressure
{from various sides to update their teaching and learning technologies from
chalkboard and paper, which is the traditional teaching, to something called e-
learning. Educators and doctors of education also spend most of their time
researching, finding the best ways to upgrade the quality of learning in terms of
techniques, methods, and pedagogy approaches in all learning areas or
subjects.

One of the many school subjects that most of the students find difficult
is science, specifically its branch - Chemistry. One of the main problems of
science teachers is finding various learning strategies that would help meet the
educational needs of diverse learners. Anent to this, the use of educational
technology, including visual, audio, verbal, and interactive learning, provides a
well-organized learning environment to promote and enhance individualized
learning. As the introductory quotation shows, e-learning is seen to make more

efficient use of the available resources.

Although the periodic table is a foundational topic in chemistry,
educators have found it difficult to teach the periodic table and its related
concepts. Despite its practicality as a conceptual tool for the organization of
the chemical elements and understanding their properties, most teachers
experience difficulties teaching it. (Mokiwa et al., 2009) The issues of what

kind of knowledge is adequate for making effective instructional decisions or
2
designing appropriate learning environments are on Current research agendas
worldwide (Malcolm & Alant, 2004). The said kind of learning and difficulties in

teaching the said topic gives way to the researchers’ study.

Therefore, the proponent decided to develop ""An Implementation of
Kemistri: An e-learning Web-based Application for Chemical Elements"" that will
ease and lend help to students in knowing what combinations of compounds
and what will be its result. Besides, the system can give further information
based on the result of combined elements. The study is of significant

importance to the learners as well as to the teachers.

microorganisms, we created the Nurse Assistant Robot. The robot is equipped
with one ultra-sonic sensor for detecting any object that trigger and activate the
disinfectant alcohol with the specific distance. Camera to allow the nurse in
charge of the robot to see the direction as it has four wheels for mobility.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

In most of healthcare industries, physical monitoring has been employed. The

front liners needs to physically observe the condition of the patient, this
activity is time consuming and it lacks of social distancing and everyday
preventive actions. In June 20, 2020 the Department of Health (DOH) 13
(Caraga) has confirmed local transmission of the coronavirus disease 2019
(Covid-19) after reporting 16 new infections in Butuan City, the 16 new
infections raise Butuan City’s total number of confirmed Covid-19-positive
cases to 27. Due to these developments, Director Jose R. Llacuna Jr. called
on local government units (LGUs) to strictly implement the health protocols to
contain the spread of Covid-19. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases
admitted in hospitals is continuously increasing in the Philippines. Front liners
health care workers are faced with imminent risks of being infected. In terms
of monitoring the patient Robots have replaced humans in performing
repetitive and dangerous tasks which humans prefer not to do, or are unable
to do because of the risks, the problem also related to the requirement of
manpower to perform physical activities and need to be minimized, the

proponents also developed a monitoring system.

"AQUABOT: AN AQUATIC NICROCONTROLLER-BASED FLOATING
GARBAGE COLLECTOR USING OBJECT DETECTION TECHNOLOGY
","ABSTRACT

Aquabot: An Aquatic Microcontroller Based Floating Garbage using
Object Detection Technology has been developed to collect small pieces of
floating garbage on the water surface and to help the residents lived near in
coastal areas because many people don’t pay attention in picking up garbage
on the water surface. This study focuses only on the small pieces of floating
garbage on the water surface. It has object detection to get the floating
garbage and put it into the trash bin. After collecting the garbage the sensor
will sense the weight of the garbage if it’s already reaches to the maximum
load it can carry. The user can control the robot manually through the use of
Rf Controller and also the robot can identify garbage alone. The GPS serves
as a navigation to locate the starting point of the robot. Furthermore, it has
video feedback to see the collected small pieces of floating garbage. The
following technologies like Raspberry Pi 4, and Arduino are used in making
the robot. The proponent conducted a survey for the robot to the people lived
near in coastal areas was highly acceptable based on the total mean obtained
of 4.7. The robot was indeed useful to the residents who live in the coastal
areas because it helps them to collect the small piece of floating garbage to
help them in cleaning and preserve the environment. This eliminates the
manual way of collecting the garbage. It was important to be more safety and

maintain the cleanliness of the environment.

INTRODUCTION

4.1 Rationale of the Study

Marine litter is human created waste that has delberately or
accidentally been released in waterway. Floating garbage tends to
accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground,
when it is also known as beach litter or tide wrack. Waste collection is the
collection of solid waste from point of production to the point of treatment or
disposal. Numerous countnes worldwide are currently facing major problems
related to waste collection, particularly in water bodies, due to the large
amount of waste generated daily by the population. Technology plays a
significant role in tackling these issues, for instance, through the development

of more effective tools to gather and collect garbage.

Object Detection is a computer technology related to computer vision
and image processing that detects and define semantic object instances from
digital image and videos, and itis also used for raspberry pi projects, Robert
Oliver et.al (2017). Microcontrollers are used in automatic controlled products
and other embedded system, it is economical to digitally control even more
device processes. In the context of IOT (Internet of things), microcontrollers
are economical and popular means of data collection, sensing and actuating

the physical world as edge device.

According to Alvahab (2019) Object detection is now becoming
apparent in industries that involve detecting instances of objects from a

particular class in an image like small piece of garbage that can be performed
ho

by detecting; it processes the image that 1s seen by the camera, Yali Amt
and Pedro Felzenszwalb (2016). The threat of waste to the envronrment,
health and safety is huge. Pollution runs into rivers and seeps into ground
water. Flooding is caused by garbage clogging drains, and the atmosphere

can be poisoned by the toxic discharge from trash.

Water pollution is one of the serious ecological threats we face today,
and the garbage is the major problem not only in the cities but also in the
water bodies Melissa, Denchak (2018). It can affect our health, manne
species and can ruin our environment. Collecting small piece of garbage on
the water surface is hard to detect due to its size especially if the floating
garbage had spread to the different direction on water surface. It is also
uncommon for people to pay attention in picking up small pieces of garbage
floating on the water surface. The widely used garbage collecting machine is
controlled manually and the problem on it is cannot be used without an

operator.

In regard of this, Aquabot: An Aquatic Microcontroller Based Floating
Garbage Collector using Object Detection Technology aims to manage
floating garbage in water way. It can detect and collect floating garbage in the
water surface. Floating garbage can be detected using object detection with
the help of OpenCV and Tersorflow. Through the use of GPS the robot can
easily navigate the surface water. It can be automatically or remotely
controlled through the used web application. Using the robot it can minimize

the manpower in cleaning the water surface.

INTRODUCTION

4.1 Rationale of the Study

Money derives its value by being a medium of exchange, a unit of
measurement and a storehouse for wealth. Payments, salaries and any kind of
business can be involved monetary aspect. According to Campello et.al (2004)
Cash is essential in any kind of payment transaction because it is convenient
and hustle free. According to Reimers et.al (2014) Despite an increasingly
convenience-oriented society, very few empirical studies have identified
convenience as a Salient determinant of store patronage. Convenient stores,
retail stores, and public markets are likewise known to be in need of more cash
especially coins. Coin is a small, flat, (usually, depending on the country or
value) round piece of metal or plastic used primarily as a medium of exchange
or legal tender. Coins are made of valuable metal that are stored in large
quantities as bullion coins. Other coins are used as money in everyday

transactions, circulating alongside banknotes.

According to Anant Vijay Kala (Anant Vijay Kala, 2013) If you've shopped
in India you likely know the problem. You go to a store to buy a few things and
when it’s time to pay, you hand over the cash. But the cashier's run out of
change. Instead of the few rupees a monetary unit of India, you’re owed, the
cashier gives you one or two candies, or a stick of chewing gum, to make up

the shortfall.
This is also one of the obvious effects of coin shortage here in the
Philippines, it is the policy of some stores to shortchange customers due
primarily to the fact that shops sometimes resulted to using candies as change.
According to Swathi V. (Swathi V., 2014) Availability of small change has
become a big issue for everybody in the city, with gradually increasing
magnitude. While traders and merchant community has always had a problem

with coin change, now the scarcity is affecting even consumers.

According to Joshi et.al (2016) Coin counting machines have yet to be
fully developed, counting and classifying currency coins with accuracy and high
speed is a challenging problem for banks and stores, and even consumers.
People used to count coins manually, this procedure was not only tedious and

time consuming, but also prone to mistakes.

To ease the issues and problems face on a certain need of the coin, the
researcher proposes a machine that capable of identifying and changing 1000,
500, 200, 100, 50, and 20peso bill to 1, 5, and 10peso coin. A machine is

capable of checking the authenticity of bill and have a free will to choose the

combined coin on exchange.

"ETUDLO: A MOBILE LEARNING TOOL FOR PRE-SCHOOL IN
OBJECT IDENTIFICATION
","ABSTRACT

Mobile learning is an exciting and important movement. In our ever-
changing marketplace, today pre-school students are being educated. Lergely
for jobs that has not yet been invented. The problem is that not all pre-school
students can identify objects easily. Based on the survey, teachers are
frequently used as a manual lecture, hence, the proponents decided to
develop an application for them to automatically identify and can help to the
pre-school students through this application. The proponents decided to use
the top-down approach which was essential in breaking down the modules of

insight this application. The goal of this study was to provide an application
which can help or support to the pre-school students of Butuan City by means
of detecting objects immediately. The proponents gathered all the data
needed to develop an application from the pre-school students of Butuan City.
The data collected has been studied and analysed by the proponents to
determine the objectives in line with the project goals. These data serve as
the reference to design and modify the application that will be created. The
user can interact with the application through the camera. When the camera
facing to the objects, it will display information of the data and automatically
speak it out. Users require password when they want to exit the application.
The e-Tudlo: A Mobile Learning Tool for Pre-School in Object Identification
has met the objectives of the study.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study
Mobile learning is an exciting and important movement. In our ever-chang-

ing marketplace, today pre-school students are being educated. Largely for jobs

that has not yet been invented. Technology is being created and updated at a

frenetic pace and growing more pervasive and useful with each stride. Accord-

ing to (Franklin Delano Rosevelt, 2017), we cannot always build the future for

our youth, but we can build our youth for the future. As schools face dwindling

resources and higher stakes than ever mobile technology hold the key in im-
proving the educational system and re-engaging pre-school students. Mobile
Technology offers plethora features and it can be benefitted in which it enables
to break the education system wide open, engaging pre-school students in
making educational experiences more meaningful if the schools can effectively
utilized, structured, and integrated approaches for implementation of this new
technology.

The curriculum of the preschool is the National Kindergarten Curriculum
Guide based on the Republic Act 8980 known as the Early Childhood Care
Development (ECCD) Act - this act promulgating a comprehensive national sys-
tem for early childhood care and development, providing funds and for the other
purposes. As children grow into early childhood, their world will begin to open
up. They will become more independent and begin to focus more on adults and
children outside of the family. They want to explore and ask about the things

around them even more. Preschools curricula take into account the length of
the preschool day. Many preschools run for only a few hours a day, while others
(especially in public school settings) run for much longer days. Some even run
longer than a typical school day to cover all the parent's work hours (Amanda
Rock, 2019)

E-learning as the appropriate application of the Internet to support the de-
livery of learning, skills, and knowledge in a holistic approach not limited to any
particular courses, technologies, or infrastructures. It considers e-learning core
products of content, technologies, and services. The emphasis is upon the im-
portance of integrated learning paths that vary according to the student, the
subject material, the level of competence, and corporate or student prefer-
ences. Successful implementation of e-learning requires the same manage-
ment commitment as other mission-critical organization-wide initiatives. Most of
all e-learning needs to be compelling to the audience targets, offering the
learner a resource that is seen as appealing, valuable and productive to their

goals and aspirations (Paul Henry, 2001)

The goal of object detection is to detect all instances of objects from a known
class, such as people, cars or faces as an image. Typically, only a small number
of instances of the object is present in the image but there is a very large num-
ber of possible locations and scales at which they can occur and need some-
how to be explored. Audio can be a necessary component in learning when
sounds themselves are the object of learning. However, audio is more often
considered when the audience is seen as needing a supplement or alternative
to text due to visual impairment, low levels of literacy, dyslexia or English being

@ second language—or simply where the target audience is not receptive to

text.
The application is more advantage than teaching the students manually in
torms in object detecting. The system can automatically detect when the cam-
era is facing an object and it will read the objects name one at a time base from
the distance of the objects from nearest to farthest. The application also re-
quires a password to exit the application for safety purposes. Based on the
proponents’ conducted survey, children age 3-5 years old are curious on things
around them especially the things inside the classroom so the application will
give them excitement to learn because it can’t just give them joy but it can also
give them knowledge in identifying the object. The application will benefit both
of the teachers and the students because it made the discussion easier and the

teacher will only guide the students in using the application while the students

will learn and enjoy at the same time.

This study aimed to provide a better way to teach the young ones to identify
the basic objects that they need to recognize and in this way, the learning of

the children will as easy as it can be.

"OPTIMIZED DRUNK-DRIVING DETECTION WITH VEHICULAR MOTION
CONTROL MECHANISM
","1V

Abstract

Optimized Drunk-Driving Detection with Vehicular Motion Control
Mechanism is developed to reduce the number of vehicular accidents due to
drunk driving. This study focuses on drivers who are using four-wheeled
vehicles travelling almost everywhere accessible. The use of four-wheeled
vehicles have been increased since its first manufacture and because of this,
accidents caused by drunk-driving using these vehicles have also been rising.
In order to accomplish the main objective, the prototype detects both the
drowsiness and the alcohol intoxication of the driver using the driver's breath.
It will calculate the measurement of the eye every time it’s closed or opened
with the use of the Eye Aspect Ratio to verify if the driver is drowsy or not. At
the same time, it will have the sensor to measure the alcohol content in the
driver's breath. The following technologies that are used in making the
prototype are following: Raspberry Pi 3 as the microcontroller, MQ-3 Alcohol
Sensor Module as utilized to detect alcohol in breath, Raspberry Pi Camera
used for stream and eye detection. With the use of the System Development
Life Cycle (SDLC) specifically the Iterative Waterfall Model the proponents
were able to track errors throughout the development process. Resulting from
the total mean obtained of 4.50 from the survey conducted means that the
proponents find the prototype beneficial to them. In conclusion, this study will
be helpful to the community to lessen road accidents caused by drunk-driving.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

In our fast-paced world, managing our personal and professional lives
can be really hectic (DeGreeff et al., 2010). If we don’t have our own personal
made of transportation, life becomes more hectic (Ellaway et al., 2002).
Driving a car is important for people in general because it provides status and
opportunity for personal control and autonomy, since it provides the only
opportunity for travelling long distances due to lack of public transport (Beirao
et al..2007). However, despite of the increasing need for vehicles, vehicular
accidents recorded have also been increasing (Hevelkeet al.,2015).. Every
day, hundreds of road traffic accidents occur (Siddique al.,2015).And the
leading cause of vehicular accidents is drunk-driving (Dills al.,2010). Because
of this, vehicular sensors and devices detect the driver’s alcohol intoxication

have been continuously manufactured and installed. (Hannon, al., 2014).

Better solutions must be made to help lessen the growing numbers of
recorded deaths and_ injuries caused by drunk-driving. The existing
procedures that law enforcers are using are still ineffective up to this
day(Emerson et al. 1980). Public agencies, law enforcers, and vehicle
manufacturers need to work together and understand the importance of
optimizing vehicular sensors (Rowlinso et al., 2004). The strategic action to
improve vehicular sensors in the purpose of saving more lives cause by

drunk-driving should not be taken for granted (Hannon, al, 2014).
Each year, there are approximately 1.24 million deaths due to road traffic
crashes — a global problem that the World Health Organization (WHO) says is
both predictable and preventable. The Philippines is also seeing worrying
figures, with the data from the Philippine Statistic Authority (PSA) showing
that the number of deaths due to road crashes has been increasing since

2006. (Bachani, 2017)

Alcohol is the leading risk factor for the road trauma globally and locally,
and leading the cause of death and disability. Based on data gathered by
local agencies, there was an alcohol-impaired traffic fatality every 48 minutes
in 2017 worldwide. These crashes involve at least one driver or motorcycle
operator with blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 grams per decilitre or above,
the legal definition of impaired driving. About 10, 500 people a year lost their

lives in alcohol-impaired crashes between 2008 and 2017. (Peden, 2017)

At present, the situation is still worsening. The accounted deaths and
injuries caused by drunk-driving have gradually increased every year since
then. And despite the overwhelming evidence and efforts of the strict
enforcement and implementations of drunk-driving policies to lead to a drastic
reduction in alcohol-related road incidents, many countries, including the
Philippines, still lack sufficient resources to facilitate the design and of

appropriate drunk-driving interventions. (Gururaj, 2017)

It is for this reason why, the proponents saw an opportunity to provide a
solution in improving the present condition by creating a prototype called
“Optimized Drunk-Driving Detection with Vehicular Motion Control

Mechanism”, that will lessen the alarming increase of not only accidents
caused by drunk-driving, but also the inconvenience drunk-driving accidents

cause in the community. (Norton, 2078)

INTRODUCTION

4.1 Rationale of the Study

In the Philippines, smoking is the single most preventable cause of early
death according to the Department of Health. Because of this, the government
raised tobacco excise taxes to reduce the number of cigarettes that are being
used by smokers. However, it still doesn’t change the fact that it is still harmful
not only in the environment but also to those who inhale it which are classified
as second-hand smokers. While the government has been increasing taxes for
goods such as cigarettes, nearly a quarter of Filipinos continue to use cigarettes
as many of them find it hard to break the habit. On May 16, 2017, Health
Secretary Paulyn Ubial said stated that the president of the Philippines, Rodrigo
Duterte, signed an Executive Order (EO) 26 which implemented the nationwide
smoking ban that prohibits smoking in all public places in the Philippines. These

no smoking locations include schools, hospitals, clinics, government offices,
food operation areas, elevators, jeepney, bus, and more. The Executive Order
also bans the sale, distribution, and purchase of cigarettes to and from minors,
this law results in reducing the majority of the non-smokers to inhale smoke
from smokers.

After the researchers’ study about the issue, the researchers came up
with the idea of developing a hardware device that will prevent smokers from
smoking in public places for the sake of secondhand smoke to avoid developing

health problems like lung cancer and other respiratory diseases. A hardware
2

device that detects smokers in public that uses image recognition to detect the

smoker and notifies the authorities. It will give the location of the smoker then

validate if it’s in the public area or not.

1.2 Project Context

Smoking is the world's leading preventable cause of death. More than
1.1. billion people smoke worldwide, according to the World Health
Organization, and more people are continually joining the ranks. Every day in
the U.S. alone, more than 3,200 youth aged 18 years old and younger smoke
their first cigarette, while another 2,100 youth and young adults move from
smoking occasionally to having it as a daily habit. The most downcast part of
the situation is that these people already know it can cause them health
problems but continue to smoking.

The researchers decided to propose A Geotagging and Detection
System of Smokers using Deep Learning to give a solution to the issue of
smoking in public that leads to the inconvenience and death of many. This
hardware device will provide a reminder to smokers in public. Given a scenario
like this, a person will smoke without knowing that the location where he/she is
smoking is a public place. With the help of this hardware device, it will help
avoid instances like that mentioned beforehand, by detecting the smoker and

displaying his/her location by getting the longitude and latitude.

system and to help the vehicular owners in Butuan City because of the fast-
growing populating of vehicle owners. This study focuses on locking,
monitoring and give messaging command (via SMS) that communicate with
the vehicular owner to update the vehicle owners from theft or unwanted

to become more interactive wherein individuals in the community could
inquire the actual vehicle status and the owners can also turn on and off the
SMS notification alert through SMS keyword. The vehicle can be monitored
through the web application. Using the System Development Life Cycle
(SDLC) as a method in making the software was very useful and helpful in
identifying errors during the development. The following technologies like
Arduino Uno, GSM and Buzzer are used in making the prototype. The
proponents conducted a survey for the software quality of the system to the
vehicular owners and was highly acceptable based on the total mean
obtained of 4.1956. The prototype was indeed useful to the vehicular owners
because it helps them to monitor the vehicle in the situation if someone else’s
in the family used it. This eliminates the manual way of locating the vehicle
real-time and late receiving of SMS warning of the vehicular owners. It was

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

Car vehicle is one of the most valued Possessions nowadays and having
one of this in the Philippines most specially to ordinary company employee is
very difficult to become a reality and losing it is really a cruel imagination if it
happens. Therefore, looking for other means of securing cars from theft using
the present technology (Laguador, J.M., et al 2013).

In recent years theft has been seriously increased and there is no safety
for people and their properties. Security plays a vital role in monitoring a
building in the absence or presence of people. Theft refers to the crime
involving the taking of a person’s property without their permission. Most of the
theft happens by door break-ins. 75% of theft occurs during night time. The thief
may take off the fuse, so they cannot be easily identified and if they caught,
they can be easily escaped (Deepika, S. et al, 2015).

Based in Camp Crame, January 5 to September 6, 214 vehicles were
Stolen on the streets while 140 forcibly taken from their owners in residential
areas (villages and subdivisions). These represent 44% and 29%, respectively,
of a total of 489 reported carnapping cases. With Directorate for Investigation
and Detective Management (DIDM) records that show 64% of carnapping
incidents during said period happened between 12:01 and 8: 00 in the morning
(Gonzales, S., 2015).

With the fast-growing population of vehicle owners, it is difficult to locate

one to others manually. With the help of a vehicular locking system with real-
time location monitoring using GPS and Arduino, it presents an easy way of
tracking the vehicle speed and location. It also provides remote access to the
vehicle that the owner has the privilege to stop the vehicle when it will be stolen
and activating the emergency alarm by SMS.

GPS, or the Global Positioning System, is a global navigation satellite
system that uses at least 24 satellites, a receiver and algorithms to provide
location, velocity and time synchronization for air, sea and land travel. The
satellite system consists of six earth-centered orbital planes, each with four
satellites. GPS works at all times and in almost all weather conditions. This post
answers “What is GPS?” and explains how it works. In general, there are five
key uses of GPS: Location, Navigation, Tracking, Mapping, and Timing. (Keyes
J. et al, 2017)

Meanwhile, Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on
easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs -
light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message and turn it into an
output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online.
You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the
microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming
language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on
Processing.

Thus, the combination of GPS using Arduino, is relevant to create a tool
in which every vehicular user can use as a locator of the vehicles. With this, it
can allow you to get a real-time view of the position, route, and time of travel in
any vehicle, allowing you to get an understanding of the location of any vehicle

in your fleet, no matter how big or how small. In addition to these features, the
proponents aim to include the remote feature of the system in which the user
can remotely stop the vehicle in case of an unauthorized user of the vehicle.
Hence, the study aimed to provide a solution to the problem concerning the

rampant vehicle theft on the community.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale

Humans are now living in a world with the potential of becoming one of
the greatest threats of our lifetime. Coronavirus disease or widely known as
Covid-19, changed the world drastically. It spread quickly from one country to
another, and last March 12, 2020, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declared
Covid-19 as a pandemic. According to World Health Organization (WHO), a
pandemic is the worldwide spread of a new disease. It has a larger scale of
outbreaks compared to any other illness. Based on the World Health
Organization Coronavirus Disease Dashboard, the United States of America,
which currently has the most recorded case in the world today, has an average
of 13,258 confirmed cases per 1 million population and 815 confirmed cases
per 1 million people in the Philippines alone (WHO, July 2020). And with the
same source, globally, as of 10:32 am CEST, July 31, 2020, there have been
17, 064,064 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 668,073 deaths, reported
to WHO. This number proves how fatal and fast this virus can be transmitted

from one person to another.

This pandemic brought significant effects to human health as it changes
lifestyle, diet, and people's lives in general. Instantly, vitamin C's become part
of everyone's meal. People are obliged to wear a face mask and observed
social distancing. The government imposes regulations on health protocols,
which will probably take long before being lifted. Also, most governments
worldwide have temporarily closed educational institutions to contain the

spread of the Covid-19 pandemic (UNESCO 2020).
Within the Philippines, the Covid-19 emergency nas influenced almost
27 million learners, 7 million instructors, non-teaching staff. and leamers
families (Obana J., May 2020). However, the education secretary reiterated
eagerness to pursue learning even though the risk is at hand (Briones L., July
2020). This campaign paved the way for the adoption of multisle learning
modalities. However, the education department emphasizes that no face-to-
face learning delivery for this school year adherence to the Inter-Agency Task
Force (IATF). This means that education institutions will have to make the most
with blended, distance, and online learning are optional for learning delivery. lf
and when limited face-to-face learning will be allowed, there will still be some
restrictions. The likelihood of compelling to wear a face mask with a face shield
and observance of physical distancing will always take effect, much like the

same scenario of gradually changing a particular area's quarantine status

it was having been observed the situation and as it remains fluid triggers
the proponents to seek ways in aiding regulators in the implementation of health
protocols. It leads the proponents to propose developing a system using
OpenCV and Keras/TensorFlow to help monitor and remind students and
school personnel, and visitors in wearing a facemask and observing social

distance.

"AUTOMATED AQUASCAPE TANK USING RASPBERRY PI (IOT)
","ABSTRACT

Automated Aqua Scape Tank (IOT) using Raspberry Pi has been
developed to give an aid specifically for the people who have pet shops and
handle large amounts of different animals to minimize their tasks and to
individuals who love to keep a fish but do not have enough time. This study
focuses only on the water level detection, water toxicity detection, and
automatic feeding of fishes. Furthermore, notification systems (via SMS) were
also included in the study to be more interactive wherein the pet owner will
receive a message whenever the water level in the fish tank decreases and
also will receive a message whenever the fish food container is empty. It is for
the owner to be notified. The Raspberry Pi has been chosen to be used as a
microcontroller in gathering information from the water level sensor and pH
sensor and mechanically control the aqua scape tank. The proponent
conducted a survey for the software quality of the system to the pet shop
owners and other individuals who are petting a fish in a tank. The software was
indeed functional because it helps them to feed and care for the fishes inside
the tank in the owner's absence. This study also eradicates the manual way of
changing the water whenever it becomes dirty and deadly for the fishes.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

These days, people have adapted technological modemizations in
caring and interacting with animal pets at their homes. The duty and
responsibility of the one who feels fond of a pet make it strenuous to manage
their time. With the contemporary technologies in these times, people have
worked to take care of their pets automatically. Fishes are common animals to
be pet and used as hobbies or decorations at home and offices. It requires
enough food and adequate shelter for petting a fish. Its place must clean to
make it healthier and live a bit longer. A tank with a given volume is where the
fish will grow in a specific maximum size (Moore et al., 1977). The size of the
tank depends on the quantity and dimensions of the fishes that place in it. The
bigger the fish will get or the more fish to be identified, the larger and the bigger

the tank will need.

The tank's water is renewed by freshwater being introduced tangentially
at a point along the tank's periphery and circulating slowly towards a centrally
situated outlet (Pullola et al., 1987). The tank is required to have enough water
in buckets to fill it up. Doing it handiwork is a difficult task itself. Moreover,
whenever the fish needs to be fed, manual feeding must be done to pick and

drop exact amounts of fish food in the tank and be observed personally.

The development of the Internet of Things (loT) points to a change in
data gathering. A cumulative amount of data composed today is generated by

sensors (Jyoti et al., 2016). The data gathered from the sensors will be collected
by the microcontrollers that perform a huge role in developing the project.
Raspberry Pi belongs to the most widely used microcontrollers (Martinez,
2016). The Raspberry Pi has been chosen as a microcontroller to gather
information from the pH sensor module, water level sensor module and

automatically contro! the feeder inside the tank.

Therefore, the proponents developed an Automated Aqua Scape Tank
using Raspberry Pi (loT) to aid people who have a pet shop and handle many
different animals. To minimize their tasks and for other individuals who love to
keep a fish at their office or home but do not have enough time to take good

care of it, especially while they are away from their home.
1.2 Project Context

The Automated Aqua Scape Tank using Raspberry Pi (loT) intends to
contribute to the problems encountered by the people who keep or pet a fish.
The proposed study will be responsible for maintaining a clean and healthy
environment in fish tanks by doing it automatically. A common problem of a pet
owner in its aquarium was the monitoring of the fish. An automated aqua scape
tank will be able to help pet shops that sell plenty of fishes. Most of the fish
owners encountered the difficulty of manually removing and changing the water
on the tank and the struggle of feeding and monitoring the fishes. The proposed
project had an automatic and manual setup of time regarding the feeding of the

fishes. When it is set automatically, the fish food container will be released
based on the time the owner puts it. Furthermore, it will terminate an appropriate

amount of food depending on how many fishes are inside the tank.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

Viruses that can cause pandemics are not new in our world. Viruses we
already face before, such as the SARS-CoV pathogen, were responsible for
8,000 cases in 2013, and MERS-CoV pathogen was responsible for 2,494
points in the year 2012 (Li, X., Zai, J., Zhao, Q., YiLi, Q.N., Foley, B.T., Chaillon,
A., 2020). Those viruses are contagious to indirect and direct transmission.
Once the virus contaminated the environment, the person must be careful
because when it touches a contaminated object, hands can then initiate self-
inoculation of mucous membranes of the nose, eyes, or mouth that is the
indirect transmission. Direct transmission happens when a person talks and

touches an infected person.

Some of the protocols and controls include the need for hand hygiene
and personal protective equipment and to minimize self-contamination to
reduce the spread. For protection against inoculation of mucosal surfaces in
the respiratory tract, enhanced surface cleaning and disinfection are common
control contributors (Otter, J.A., Donskey, C., Yezli, S., Douthwaite, S.,
Goldenberg, $.D., Weber, D.J., 2016). The syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-

CoV-2) is now tranche called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Nowadays, due to the coronavirus pandemic, people discover many
disinfection and sanitation products in the market, and some local officials are
encouraging the public to use face masks and face shields when going to a

public place or riding a public utility vehicle. Businesses and establishments
were required to implement social distancing, hand sanitation, and check a
person's temperature before entering the building. However, when a person
goes back home from buying foods or items, the sanitation and disinfection of

items or products were neglected.

With this overlooked aspect, the proponents proposed a Micro-controller
Based System for Object Disinfection and Sanitation. It is a multitask
disinfection and sanitation machine that was able to identify objects like food,
non-food products. For development, the proponents maximize the use of

raspberry pi and Arduino Uno with OpenCV libraries in Python for image

processing as front-end.

INTRODUCTION

4.1 Rationale of the Study

The gaming industry is no longer a niche arena for a specific age
group or consumer segment. With the advent of mobile gaming and
improvements to hardware used in playing these games, gaming has
become a viable entertainment form for players from all backgrounds and
ages. At present, mobile games are downloaded onto smartphones or
tablets using an app store or are embedded in the device when
purchased. Games can be played on the device or over the cloud
(Luenendonk, 2019). As game developers build increasingly multifaceted
and interactive worlds, gamers are tasked to tackle ostensibly solvable
problems that require them to make measured, tested, and learning-based
decisions either alone or with a team effort. (""Game Changer: Video
Games and Real-World Problem Solving, Part One,"" n.d.).

The Manobo community is fraught with challenges and issues both
from external and internal sources. The Manobo of Barangay Pakwan,
Lanuza, Surigao Del Sur reside within the forests of Mount Hilong-Hilong.
According to Haribon Foundation, Mount Hilong-Hilong is the highest
mountain in North Eastern Mindanao and a vast range of wildlife. The
ancestral domain of the Manobo can also be found within the areas.

For the Manobo group, the forest is both the treasure and the life of

the tribe. Before its declaration as Barangay Pakwan in 1981, the Manobo
have already inhabited the area. Reports accounted that they have lived a
simple life, practicing harmony with the forests through their culture and
traditions. They farmed crops, hunted wild animals, and carried out rituals
and tribal celebrations for the Magbabaya (the Creator). Lasting for more
than four decades, the tribe was a witness to the damage caused by the
massive deforestation at that time, including the decline of wildlife such as
the usa (deer), amo (monkey), ayaw (hornbill), milo (wild cats), or the
complete loss of species in the area such as the Banug (Philippine eagle).
which can no longer be spotted today. The Manobo have also reported
lower water levels, more down fish catch, and a warmer climate. The
passing of the Indigenous Peoples (IPs) Rights Act and the creation of the
National Commission of Indigenous People in 1997 paved the way for the
Manobo tribe members to organize their association, which enabled them
to protect the forest, their ancestral domain, and rights, and to preserve
their cultural way of life. (Zambas, 2019).

Illegal mining and other activities were very devastating towards the
ancestral land of the Manobos; fortunately, there has been action taken
with the example when two tribal chieftains in Surigao Del Norte have
asked the Office of the Ombudsman to investigate Surigao Del Sur Rep.
Prospero Pechay and seven others for conspiracy to illegally mine,
transport and sell nickel ores from their ancestral lands. The complainants
are Datu James Biol and Datu Reynante Buklas of the Manobo tribe,

respectively. In a graft and grave abuse of authority complaint, they
accused Pechay of conspiring with Mines and Geosciences Bureau
officials in allowing the illegal mining activity in Bgy. Taganito, Claver,
Sungao Del Norte (Bonquin, 2016).

In this day and age, mobile gaming has been a massive part of
everyone's life, including the youth; using this as an advantage, the
proponents have devised a game application that will attract younger
users to spread awareness about the struggles of the Manobo tribes
featuring their mythological and spiritual practices that are lesser-known

typical users.

different from others, the ALStudy takes advantage of existing LMS features
but focusing only for ALS, following their class structures and curriculum.

Keywords:
Learning Management System (LMS), ALStudy
","Chapter |
INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

Alternative Learning System is a substitute for a formal primary
education, which the government established to support less privileged
students who want fo finish formal education. Republic Act 9155 of the
Philippines stipulates that the Altemative Learning System (ALS) provides out-
of-school children, youth, and adults with primary schooling. With Alternative
Learning System (ALS), it gives a chance to students to continue to access and
to complete primary education. A PSA Annual Poverty Indicator Survey-2017
shows that many Filipinos do not have an opportunity to attend and finish formal
primary education (Grades 1-6, Junior High School! and Senior High School).
Some of the students drop out of schools, while some do not have schools in
their communities. Besides having no school in an isolated area, the Alternative

Learning System (ALS) medium is limited with face-to-face.

The advancement of technology and the Internet brought an increasing
avenue for managing and accessing learning. A learning management system
(LMS) allows the students to study through dynamic mediums, such as face-to-
face, blended and online. There are many existing Learning Management

systems, and most of them used in a fully online manner.

Integrating an Online Learning Management System (LMS) in an
Alternative Learning System (ALS) will bridge the gap for students who will not
attend a class in a face-to-face manner. It will also address the problem in

dealing with those isolated areas that do not have a physical Learning center.
Based on this matter, the proponents proposed an ALStudy: A Learning
Management System for Alternative Learning System School that. allows the
teachers to manage learning materials and activities. Also, it will enable the
teacher or trainer to monitor the progress of students. Similarly, the students
will benefit from accessing the portal to do the task and activities online. It will
bridge the gap between having no physical classroom in isolated areas and

allowing them to continue their primary education through the portal provided.

Introduction

4.1 Project Context

Despite the advancement in machine learning, making cornputers
understand language is still a big challenge nowadays. Computers can use
many different words. They can dictate, record, or playback language, but
they really have no idea about human language. Computers lack common
sense that makes it tricky to deal with simple command by humans.
Moreover, the human language is full of context and semantics that makes
the process of natural language recognition difficult. Computer systems do not
have much knowledge of the world and do not do a good job of making use of
the context. Additionally, language has grammar which should be followed by
both sides. There are some human language’s structures that differ but
contain the same meaning. This can be tricky for a computer to understand.
Computers only have the ability to perform the tasks they are programmed to
do. Computers’ weakness is that they do not really understand anything.

Michael Cowling (2015) wrote for LifeHacker, he said that “to be able
for a computer to understand what human utterance meant, it has to be first
understood”. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial
intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret and manipulate human
language. NLP aims to develop methods for processing, analyzing and

understanding natural language. Additionally, according to Wendy G. Lehnert

pS
et al (2014), they stated that “one of the hardest parts of NLP is the speech
recognition problem”. But the problems of symbolic meaning representation
are far greater than even the linguists suspected. One of the major difficulties
is the problem of inference in natural language processing.

There are various approaches for NLP application one of them is Rule-
Based (RB) approach, a simple kind of artificial intelligence which uses a
series of IF-THEN statements that guide a computer to reach a conclusion or
recommendation. RB system is good at capturing a specific language
phenomenon. This approach can be used in natural language processing or
to perform lexical analysis to understand what is it the speaker really means.

in this regard, this study focused on how a RB approach can be used
in terms of analyzing a command since the study only caters imperative
sentences that also have significance to basic algebraic problem commands.
This paper aims to create a command analyzer to be implemented in solving
basic algebra. An application that uses vocal inputs as a corpus for natural

language processing used in understanding a command.

Propose an approach that does not need the use of assistive hardware

technologies for hand gesture recognition. In addition, this study will apply the

OpenPose library for the pose estimation and the Hidden Markov Model for
the learning process. Ten (10) common phrases that are more likely to be

sequences. By performing three experiments with a total of 75 testing tries
each and done by training one (1), two (2), and four (4) data set entry per
state sequences on random tries, there is 0% accuracy in the first experiment,
1.44% and 28% in the second and third experiment. From these results, the
researchers conclude that the accuracy of recognizing the signs depends on
how well the data set is trained. In order to have more accurate recognition, a
large amount of dataset per state sequence will be needed. By implementing
the OpenPose for the pose estimation process and the HMM for the

INTRODUCTION
4.1 Project Context

As our human visual understanding of the world is reflected in our
ability to make decisions through what we see, providing a such visual
understanding to computers has become a heightened area of research
nowadays. Computer Vision is a field in Artificial Intelligence and Computer
Science that aims to give computers a visual understanding of the world. It is
concerned with the automatic extraction, analysis, and understanding of
useful information from a single image or a sequence of images. The goal of
Computer Vision is to emulate human vision using digital images through
three main processing components: Image Acquisition, Image Processing,

and Image Analysis and Understanding, executed one after another.

Since then, there has been a surging interest in recognizing human
hand gestures, with the aim to provide an accurate and convenient
mechanism to transcribe sign gestures into meaningful text or speech. One of
its manifestations is the innovation that benefits the communication with the

Deaf and Mute community (Padmanabhan & Sornalatha, 2014).

Communication facilitates the spread of knowledge and forms
relationships between people. It helps us in expressing our ideas and feelings,

and it, at the same time, helps us to understand emotions and thoughts of the
others. However, some people who have the inability to speak and hear are
somehow restricted from interacting with the outer world to share their

feelings, creative ideas and potentials (Ghorpade & Waghmare, 2015).

Based on the 2000 Philippine census, there are approximately
421,000 Deaf-Mute people living in the Philippines. Ghorpade and Waghmare
(2015) remarked that the only means of communicating among the deaf-mute
community is the use of sign language. However, there is a petty number of
speech-enabled people who learn to do sign language and this limitation

increases the isolation of the deaf-mute people from the common society.

This matter leads to the development of several assistive
technologies regarding sign language translation. Thus, having a significant

beneficial impact on the deaf-mute community's social lives.

The American Sign Language (ASL) is a natural language that
serves as the predominant sign language of Deaf communities in the United
States and Canada and has spread all over the world. There has been a
number of developed technologies that incorporates several devices like
gloves and sensors in detecting gestures for American Sign Language

translation in a one-way or two-way process.

However, the reliance to gloves and sensors is subject to cost and
comfortability issues. Additionally, there is a high consideration with the

dependence on sign language interpreters in a daily life basis. The
interpreters’ schedule availability can be an interference. (Rouse & Barrow,

2018)

It is for this reason that the researchers have come up with the idea
on developing a prototype for American Sign Language Translator that will

help solve the above issues.

","ABSTRACT

This study aimed to develop an effective and efficient Automated Class
Scheduling System of ACLC College of Butuan specifically in the Information
Technology Education (ITE) department to help minimize the ITE Dean’s
problems in scheduling classes for both students and the faculty. The researchers
identified hard and soft constraints to determine the conditions in making the

was developed.

In developing the system, the researchers adapted the Systems

functional systems development activity and to gain control of the complexities of
the systems development. The System Development Life-Cycle (SDLC) was
tailored to the study environment that led to the successful development of the

determine and evaluate the user acceptance of the system. A survey questionnaire
was answered by random respondents. According to the results gathered by the
researchers, the random students and members of the faculty are satisfied with the

overall performance of the system.
","CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTION
1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY

The general area of scheduling has been the subject of intense research for

a number of decades. In the most general terms, scheduling can be described as
the constrained allocation of resources to objects, being placed in space-time in
such a way as to minimize the total cost of a set of the resources, Moreover,
“Schaerf”, described scheduling as the activity of allocating resources and, at the
same time satisfying some predetermined objectives. “Schaerf”, added that due to
the enormity of the problems, it becomes necessary to classify the scheduling
problem into specialized activity such as timetabling.

An Automated Class Scheduling System is a multi-user system that will
help school administrators scheduling classes, by providing an easier task in
arranging class schedules, instructor’s load and room utilization for the students
and faculty. One of the most important parts of any academic institution is the
class timetable. According to “Oladejo” and “Babatunde”, a timetable is a
mysterious abstract object with no real existence of its own, but exerting absolute
authority on the way any academic institution carries out its everyday business.
Being a student or a staff member, it involves an implicit acceptance of the fact
that your movements and thoughts will be greatly influenced by your class

schedules for the duration of an academic session, Thus, the class timetable of
ACLC College is indeed a routine which is regarded as a system where in the
students, the members of the faculty and staff relies on.

Several problems are faced in the allocation of time periods and subjects
while scheduling limited resources for several classes. The growing number of
students while the inadequate number of facilities of the school pose a lot of
problems. Among these problems are: delayed in times of scheduling; poor

"AN AUTOMATED ACCESS CONTROL
IN COMPUTER LABORATORY USING RFID SYSTEM
","aii
ABSTRACT

Entry to utility rooms where the use has oriented with people is necessary
to be automated for the optimum solution of delays and access failures due to
misuse of room keys. Automated doors are no new for post-modern era with the
advent of remote signal-triggered devices. Radio Frequency Identification
Systems is the most used system of signal communication nowadays. This study

rotates the idea of time-permission to enter rooms, with the use of Role-Based
Access Control methods of regulating access, the mode of permission and
restriction to access the computer Laboratory in ACLC brings into its optimum

level from manual keying to swiping of RFID cards.

Keywords: automated access control, radio frequency identification system,

Introduction

1.1 Background of the Study

Access control is concerned with determining of legitimate users,
mediating every attempt by a user to access a resource in the system (Vincent et
al., 2006). The objectives of an access control system are often described in terms
of protecting system resources against inappropriate or undesired user access.
Access control is, in reality, an everyday phenomenon. A lock on a car door is
essentially a form of access control even a personal identification number on

an automated teller machine system is also another means of access control.

In physical security, the term access control refers to the practice of
restricting entrance to a property, a building, or a room to authorized persons
through mechanical means such as locks and keys, or through technological
means such as access control systems like the mantrap. Within these
environments, physical key management may also be employed as a means of

further managing and monitoring access to mechanically keyed areas or access to

certain small assets.
An information system can implement access control systems at different
levels: operating systems employ access control to protect files and directories;
database management systems apply access control to regulate access to data; the
use of electronic devices to perform automated access control. The concept of
automated access control is brought about using a card, a corresponding card
reader and a control panel interfaced with the server. The card has a unique
identification number integrated in it. The reader reads the data through radio
frequency (RF), and sends it to the control panel which is the micro controller.
This controller checks the validity of the data with the server, which bears the

database. This is called the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) system.

RFID system is a flexible technology that is convenient, easy to use, and
well suited for automatic operation. It combines advantages not available with
other identification technologies. RFID can be supplied as read-only or read /
write, does not require contact or line-of-sight to operate, can function under a
variety of environmental conditions, and provides a high level of data integrity. In

addition, because the technology is difficult to counterfeit, RFID provides a high

level of security.

Most schools have not developed efficient control regulations regarding

keys to the building. In many cases, key proliferation has been caused by the
public’s use of school facilities after school hours. In some schools, keys that
have been duplicated, lost, or stolen are often more accessible to students than
staff. Some easy solutions for controlling access to building keys can be
accomplished through policy development which is discussed in many types of
access control methodologies, including Role-based Access Control (RBAC)

which the restriction involves time, type of request authentication, and

authorization.

This proposal will conduct a study to implement an automated access
control in Computer Laboratory in AMA Computer Learning Center, Butuan City
(ACLC) Computer Laboratories are oriented with number of computers and other
resources which security is required. As a solution we propose an automated

access control using RFID system.

The proposed system is being implemented using passive tags and radio
frequency readers which performing the communication of the data being
interpreted by the computer. The application is developed through parallel port
programming to interface the mechanically-equipped prototype (door miniature).
In the application the method Role-based access control played significant role for

doing the safe permission and restriction.

INTRODUCTION

1.1. Background of the Study

A source code of a program written in one programming language,
known as source language that is translated to another programming
language, known as target language with equivalent output is called a
transcompiler, transpiler or a source-to-source compiler. Transcompiler is
used to reduce the amount of time to convert a source code from one
language to another language, as it will be done programmatically. Constructs
and syntaxes can be shortened in order to reduce complexity and time spent
writing code to get work done. The code generated can be run on various
platforms without the need to write the source on each platforms. More
importantly, it is a great medium to learn computer programming provided that

syntaxes can be simplified.

A transcompiler that supports development of web applications or
websites without the need to learn fundamentally two or more computer
languages, takes one source language and converts it to four (4) different
computer language. These four (4) languages are commonly used in web
development and that they are linked together and as what the researchers
Observed, they have one common purpose. The purpose of building
accessible websites that enables website visitors to flexibly interact. First of
the four language is HTML, HTML in front end shows the structure or more

likely the skeleton of a website. Buttons, input fields and images are some of
2

the many elements that form HTML. One feature of HTML is linking to
websites including extemal linking to CSS, JavaScript and PHP. Second is
CSS, primarily the document presentation while HTML is more on the
document content. It describes how the elements in HTML should be
rendered. Third is JavaScript, it enables the HTML to be more dynamic and
interactive. Early web Pages contents use this to implement animation on
events that elements or objects are interacted, like click buttons or pictures to
Slide images what is now commonly known as carousel or image slider. CSS
did not support animations back then. Lastly, the fourth is PHP, not like the
three (3) earlier stated languages, PHP runs on the server while the three
others run on the client’s side. In the server, the PHP receives, process data,
and sends data back to the requesting end, the client’s end. Accompanied
with MySQL, a database system that stores data, PHP allows this to store and

access contents to be thrown back to the user's view in the web browser.

As lyushin (2016) stated in their study “On source-to-source compilers”,
computer technologies like computer languages have been evolving for past
few decades. There are a lot of computer programs that are needed to
maintain and rewrite when releasing new technology. And the vast spread of
portable devices increases that demands on quality developed programs. All
mentioned reasons require a large amount of effort from programmers.
Moreover, in the web development or programming, scripting languages like
JavaScript & Python also raises new problems. Problems like code
inconsistency and more. In their study, they have acknowledge the use of
Source-to-source compilers, also known as transcompiler or transpiler to help

resolve these problems.
3

Since creating dynamic webpages require two or more computer
languages to make, then there would be two or more errors to handle.
Assuming that amateur developers are working alone, this would be time
consuming and that there are instances that they would be troubled on
making perfect personalized designs with Cascading StyleSheet. Web
developer has his or her ups and downs with designing CSS even
professionals. Writing with so many computer languages would be like
speaking two or more language, we could mix up them up both but it would be

grammatical error, though the idea is there.

By using one source programming language, it would be simple and
trouble-free to develop web pages. Beginners in web development will not
have to master or familiarize more than one computer language to develop or
achieve an attractive website. The programming language will cater both front
and backend development. They don't have to study PHP, JavaScript, HTML,

CSS and many more web development focused technologies.

It would be preferably quick and easy to develop websites just by
learning to code a single programming language. The researchers thought
about one file could just be the equivalent of 2 or 3 files source codes. Hence,
for web development a single programming language source can be used as
leverage to effectively write code that would just be equivalent to multiple

computer language.

"Android Malware Detection with Permission-based Scoring Analysis
","ABSTRACT

Android smart phone is one of the fast growing mobile phones and because of

these it the one of the most preferred target of malware developer. Malware apps can

penetrate the device and gain privileges in which it can performs malicious activities such

reading user contact, misusing of private information such as sending SMS and can harm

user by exploiting the users private data which is stored in the device. This study is about

implementation of detecting malwares on android applications, which would be the basis

of all future development regarding malware detection. The main reason why the
researchers came up with this study is that majority of the smartphone users worldwide
are not aware of the permissions as the basis of all malicious activities that could possibly
operate in an android system and may steal personal and private information .Android
operating system is open system in which users are allowed to install application from
any unsafe sites. However permission mechanism of and android system is not enough
to guarantee the invulnerability of the application that can harm the user. In this paper we
propose a permission scoring-based analysis that will scrutinized the installed permission
and allows user to increase the efficiency of Android permission to inform user about the
risk of the installed Android apps. In this paper we propose a framework that would
Classify the level of sensitivity of the permission access by the application. The framework
use a formula that will calculate the sensitivity level of the permission and to determine if
the installed application is malicious or not. Our result show that, in a collection of 26

malicious application, the framework is able to correctly determine the application's

behavior consistently and efficiently.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background of the Study

Nowadays, the advancement of technology is rapid. Today, a new product is being
introduced to the market and in a week, month later a new one surfaces with a better
functionality against its predecessors. Mobile phones are not exempted in the
advancement of technology. From call and text only functionality, mobile phones

became smartphones (Android) which serves as pocket computers.

Android operating system permits the android user to install application from third
party app stores, but also creates major security challenges. Android security has
permission system mechanism which restricts access of third party application to
critical resources on android devices. This is to inform the user about the risk while
using the application. In order to install the application from device you need to grant
all of the permissions that the application request and most of the users are not paying
attention or do not fully comprehend the requested permission. And these permissions
permit the malware to penetrate or exploit private data stored on device and perform
malicious activities such as reading users private information, track user location, log-
in credentials, and web browser history. Example of this permission is the INTERNET,
many of the apps communicate over the internet and malware developer leverage the
use of this permission and combine it with other permission such the
READ_PHONE_STATE that allow the malicious application to retrieve device

information and send them to a remote server.
2

According to Barrera et. al. (2010) some of the Android developer has lack of
knowledge in the process of permissions they just simply use it just to make sure that
their application works Properly. Therefore, a combination and unprofessional use of

permission can take the advantage of stealing user’s private data.

According to Enck et. al. (2011), the existing security permission model of android
has flaws that cannot protect the user’s private data effectively. Several researchers,
Ontang et. al. (n.d), questioned the Android security model, and stated that “the current

permission model cannot meet certain requirements’.

This proposal will conduct a Study to detect the behavior of the malicious apps that
can manipulate information on android devices. As asolution we present a permission-
based scoring detection which will evaluate the permission of the application and

identify the application if it’s malicious or not.

","Chapter 1

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background and Rationale

When living in a large city or any area where there are lots of
commuters and vehicles on the road, traffic congestion effects are probably
familiar. Delays due to traffic can make people late for work, air pollution due
to increase in fuel emissions released by vehicles and road rage caused by
frustrated drivers in traffic. Finding a solution to traffic congestion could mean

a vast improvement in the quality of life.

This study sets out to assess whether there is a potential use for
images collected through the increasingly ubiquitous use of CCTV (Closed —
Circuit Television System) cameras in urban areas as means of increasing
understanding of the causes of road traffic congestion. Realtime video live
feed of traffic congestion from CCTV or Camera records could provide

information notification on highway authorities.

Thus, CCTV or Camera perspective is an integral part of this study that
provides speed, time, and direction of traffic congestion. This study proposes
that the TCD (Traffic Congestion Detection) system's CCTV or Camera
perspective will detect cars using OpenCV's Haar-like features (Haar
Cascade) and classify whether the specific area is in light traffic, in moderate

traffic or in heavy traffic congestion.

Introduction

1.1 Project Context
The study of the brain has been catching interest for a long time. The
advancements in the fields of electronics and computer science led to the
assumption that we can use the brain’s natural thinking process to design
some artificial intelligence systems (Kumar, P., & Sharma, P., 2014). The
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been used in studies to decipher
characters and identify the handwriting (Mills, T, 2018), as it imitates the
biological neural network of the human brain. It reproduces the neurons and
the interconnections that built from coefficients (weights) where it was
composed of the artificial neurons made up of silicon and wires. The inter-
neuron connection strengths, synaptic weights, function as the knowledge
storage of the ANN (Gnanasegaram, T, 2017). These are particularly useful
in solving problems that are unfit to be expressed as a series of steps.
Examples are pattern recognition and classification, series prediction, and
data mining (Chiranjeevi, A, 2014). These biologically-inspired
computational models exceed the performance of the previous types of
artificial intelligence when it comes to machine learning tasks. Two of some
useful forms of ANN architecture are the Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which are used to solve

difficult image-driven pattern recognition tasks. Their precise yet simple

1
architecture offers a simplified method of getting started with ANNs (Keiron,

O & Ryan, N, 2015), and the application of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

models, another important branch of the deep neural network’s family, is

mainly designed for handling sequences (Shi B, Bai X & Yao, C, 2015)

respectively.

In the field of medicine, a physician's illegible handwriting in medical
prescriptions is one of the most important contributing factors of medical
errors that receives limited attention (H. Brits, A. Botha, L. Niksch, R.
Terblanché, K. Venter & G. Joubert, 2017). According to the study
published by the Philippine Council for Health Research and Development
(PCHRD), 28% of Filipino patients considered their doctors’ handwriting on
medical prescriptions unreadable. Pharmacists, who read the medical

prescriptions and administer medicine to patients, tend to carry the

responsibility for any error that may occur therein.

In health care where the coordination of information, decisions, and
actions involving several professionals and departments must occur
flawlessly in real time, technological systems can introduce new safety risks
(RAND Health, May 2014) since they immensely contribute to the

advancement of the automation process and improve the interface between

man and machine in numerous applications (Attigeri, S., 2018). However,

written medical prescriptions are already an implemented custom in

prescribing medicines, and the idea of adopting electronic prescriptions is
still currently in progress in the field of medicine. Hence, creating a
prototype application that will assist the pharmacists in reading illegible
handwritings in medical prescriptions will help make their work easier.

The purposes of this study are: 1) to understand this age-old problem of
doctors and pharmacists, 2) to provide an overview of the effects of illegible
handwriting to the quality of medical care, and 3) to introduce a more
comprehensive approach towards the management of this avoidable
medical error (Sadananda, N, 2016). In the present work, an attempt has
been made to implement the neural network technique for word recognition.
The Neural Network can be very efficient in analyzing data if given the right
set of training. We can recognize the handwriting of the doctor and try to
get some pattern which will be used to guess the most probable medicine
prescribed. In this study, the Handwritten Medical Prescription Reader
using Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks is a prototype

application that helps in translating illegible handwriting in medical

prescriptions and transcribing it into a readable format.

"Voice Command Analyzer (VCA): A Rule-Based Approach for Natural

Human-computer interaction innovation is one of the biggest trends in
the IT field or the IT industry. But despite our technological advancements, it
is still a big challenge to create innovations that can suffice and address the
needs to improve human-computer interaction. One of main methods to
address this dilemma is using natural language processing. Rule-Based (RB)
approach for Natural Language Processing (NLP) uses series of “if-then’”
statement to analyze and understand natural human language. With the help
of speech utterance driven platforms to capture the voice input which is
specified into imperative statement only. With the objectives to create a model
that can analyze and understand voice command inputs. The study is

challenges throughout the development and implementation of the RB
approach for NLP into an android application. However the results were all
promising, the researchers can produce a correct analyzation of the voice

command in relative to the correct solution and answer to the basic algebraic

problems given.
","4.1 Project Context
Despite the advancement in machine learning, making computers
understand language is still a big challenge nowadays. Computers can use
many different words. They can dictate, record, or playback language, but
they really have no idea about human language. Computers lack common
sense that makes it tricky to deal with simple command by humans.
Moreover, the human language is full of context and semantics that makes
the process of natural language recognition difficult. Computer systems do not
have much knowledge of the world and do not do a good job of making use of
the context. Additionally, language has grammar which should be followed by
both sides. There are some human language’s structures that differ but
contain the same meaning. This can be tricky for a computer to understand.
Computers only have the ability to perform the tasks they are programmed to
do. Computers’ weakness is that they do not really understand anything.
Michael Cowling (2015) wrote for LifeHacker, he said that “to be able
for a computer to understand what human utterance meant, it has to be first
understood”. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial
intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret and manipulate human
language. NLP aims to develop methods for processing, analyzing and
understanding natural language. Additionally, according to Wendy G. Lehnert

1
et al (2014), they stated that “one of the hardest parts of NLP is the speech
recognition problem”. But the problems of symbolic meaning representation
are far greater than even the linguists suspected. One of the major difficulties
is the problem of inference in natural language processing.

There are various approaches for NLP application one of them is Rule-
Based (RB) approach, a simple kind of artificial intelligence which uses a
series of IF-THEN statements that guide a computer to reach a conclusion or
recommendation. RB system is good at capturing a specific language
phenomenon. This approach can be used in natural language processing or
to perform lexical analysis to understand what is it the speaker really means.

In this regard, this study focused on how a RB approach can be used
in terms of analyzing a command since the study only caters imperative
sentences that also have significance to basic algebraic problem commands.
This paper aims to create a command analyzer to be implemented in solving
basic algebra. An application that uses vocal inputs as a corpus for natural

language processing used in understanding a command.

storage of the ANN (Gnanasegaram, T, 2017). These are particularly useful
in solving problems that are unfit to be expressed as a series of steps.
Examples are pattern recognition and classification, series prediction, and
data mining (Chiranjeevi, A, 2014). These _ biologically-inspired
computational models exceed the performance of the previous types of
artificial intelligence when it comes to machine learning tasks. Two of some
useful forms of ANN architecture are the Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which are used to solve

difficult image-driven pattern recognition tasks. Their precise yet simple

1
architecture offers a simplified method of getting started with ANNs (Keiron,

O & Ryan, N, 2015), and the application of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
models, another important branch of the deep neural network’s family, is
mainly designed for handling sequences (Shi B, Bai X & Yao, C, 2015)
respectively.

In the field of medicine, a physician's illegible handwriting in medical
prescriptions is one of the most important contributing factors of medical
errors that receives limited attention (H. Brits, A. Botha, L. Niksch, R.
Terblanche, K. Venter & G. Joubert, 2017). According to the study
published by the Philippine Council for Health Research and Development
(PCHRD), 28% of Filipino patients considered their doctors’ handwriting on
medical prescriptions unreadable. Pharmacists, who read the medical

prescriptions and administer medicine to patients, tend to carry the

responsibility for any error that may occur therein.

In health care where the coordination of information, decisions, and
actions involving several professionals and departments must occur
flawlessly in real time, technological systems can introduce new safety risks
(RAND Health, May 2014) since they immensely contribute to the
advancement of the automation process and improve the interface between
man and machine in numerous applications (Attigeri, S., 2018). However,
written medical prescriptions are already an implemented custom in

prescribing medicines, and the idea of adopting electronic prescriptions is
still currently in progress in the field of medicine. Hence, creating a
prototype application that will assist the pharmacists in reading illegible
handwritings in medical prescriptions will help make their work easier.

The purposes of this study are: 1) to understand this age-old problem of
doctors and pharmacists, 2) to provide an overview of the effects of illegible
handwriting to the quality of medical care, and 3) to introduce a more
comprehensive approach towards the management of this avoidable
medical error (Sadananda, N, 2016). In the present work, an attempt has
been made to implement the neural network technique for word recognition.
The Neural Network can be very efficient in analyzing data if given the right
set of training. We can recognize the handwriting of the doctor and try to
get some pattern which will be used to guess the most probable medicine
prescribed. In this study, the Handwritten Medical Prescription Reader
using Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks is a prototype
application that helps in translating illegible handwriting in medical

prescriptions and transcribing it into a readable format.

","1.1 Background of the Problem

Detection of micron-sized particles at low concentrations remains a
challenge for many industries and applications, especially in the
pharmaceutical industry urban and industrial areas. There are many types
of technology used in discovering bacteria’s from motion, sounds, emitting
electromagnetic radiation, mixing chemicals, and others. According to
(Pawankumar Fakatkar (Engineering & Nagar, n.d., 2015)) To count the
colony counting system is used to count the number of colonies; this is a
time-consuming method that requires manually counting the colonies. This
type of system is susceptible to mistakes, and by using MATLAB (matrix
laboratory), with the time they were registered, circular colonies can be
easily identified.

MATLAB (matrix laboratory) has evolved over the years with input from
many users. Other image processing algorithms are used nowadays, such
as ImageJ (Java-based image processing program) and many others.

The proponent decides to design a Bacteria Particle Counter system, a

of algorithms that attempt to identify underlying relationships in a set of data
using a mechanism that resembles natural language processing how the

COVID-19 is a pandemic that has affected over 170 countries around
the world. The number of infected and deceased patients has been increasing
at an alarming rate. According to Gitanjali R. Shinde et al (2020) Forecasting

","1.1 Background of the Study

One of the containment strategies for Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
pandemic, an infectious disease caused by a new coronavirus that was first
identified in Wuhan, China, is the isolation or quarantine of infected and
potentially exposed individuals under strict surveillance and monitoring to track

and predict its host adaptation, evolution, and transmissibility (Sohrabi et al.,

2020).

However, manual and close monitoring is a rigorous, time-consuming
and risky task. It's also difficult to discern the difference of COVID-19 from other
existing diseases since the most common symptoms such as fever and cough
are also associated with other known conditions (Larsen et al. 2020), resulting
in misinformation and wrong assumption. Additionally, close monitoring can
lead to direct exposure to COVID-19, which could mean transmitting the
disease, infecting others, and limiting the number of medical experts and
response teams (Recuenco 2020). For these reasons, the availability of a tool
for digital monitoring and risk prediction would be an effective method in the

early recognition of the COVID-19.

Prediction can be achieved through the use of Machine Learning

methods (Ahamad et al. 2020). Machine Learning, a sub-field of Artificial
intelligence, provides computer systems the ability to learn and improve from
experience using data mining. Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD), also
referred to as data mining, is an intensive process to extract helpful data
patterns from massive data (Taranu 2015). Apriori algorithm can find
association rules in the retrieved data patterns (Rouse, Lutkevich, and Labbe
2017). Then, the association rules can be used in an attempt to predict the next
possible occurrence of a data item. In addition, Naive Bayes Classifier can
predict the likelihood of phenomena to occur or not based from the given data
patterns. The integration of these two methods can amplify the discovery of

significant knowledge (Nwagu et al. 2017).

The researchers propose to develop Safewatch, a prototype Quarantine
Symptom-Monitoring Web Application with Knowledge Discovery Using Naive
Bayes Classifier Based on Apriori Algorithm, with the primary purpose of
predicting the level COVID-19 risk exposure of an individual, whether it's high

or low.

Android smart phone is one of the fast growing mobile phones and because of
these it the one of the most preferred target of malware developer. Malware apps can
penetrate the device and gain privileges in which it can performs malicious activities such
reading user contact, misusing of private information such as sending SMS and can harm
user by exploiting the users private data which is stored in the device. This study is about
implementation of detecting malwares on android applications, which would be the basis
of all future development regarding malware detection. The main reason why the
researchers Came up with this study is that majority of the smartphone users worldwide
are not aware of the permissions as the basis of all malicious activities that could possibly
operate in an android system and may steal personal and private information .Android
operating system is open system in which users are allowed to install application from
any unsafe sites. However permission mechanism of and android system is not enough
to guarantee the invulnerability of the application that can harm the user. In this paper we
propose a permission scoring-based analysis that will scrutinized the installed permission
and allows user to increase the efficiency of Android permission to inform user about the
tisk of the installed Android apps. in this paper we propose a framework that would
Classify the level of sensitivity of the permission access by the application. The framework
use a formula that will calculate the sensitivity level of the permission and to determine if
the installed application is malicious OF not. Our result show that, in a collection of 26
Malicious application, the framework is able to correctly determine the application's

","1.1 Background of the Study

Nowadays, the advancement of technology is rapid. Today, a new product is being
introduced to the market and in a week, month later a new one surfaces with a better
functionality against its predecessors. Mobile phones are not exempted in the
advancement of technology. From call and text only functionality, mobile phones

became smartphones (Android) which serves as pocket computers.

Android operating system permits the android user to install application from third
party app stores, but also creates major security challenges. Android security has
permission system mechanism which restricts access of third party application to
critical resources on android devices. This is to inform the user about the risk while
using the application. In order to install the application from device you need to grant
all of the permissions that the application request and most of the users are not paying
attention or do not fully comprehend the requested permission. And these permissions
permit the malware to penetrate or exploit private data stored on device and perform
malicious activities such as reading users private information, track user location, log-
in credentials, and web browser history. Example of this permission is the INTERNET,
many of the apps communicate over the internet and malware developer leverage the

use of this permission and combine it with other permission such the

READ PHONE STATE that allow the malicious application to retrieve device

er.
information and send them to a remote serv
According to Barrera et. al. (2010) some of the Android developer has lack of
knowledge in the process of permissions they just simply use it just to make sure that
their application works properly. Therefore, a combination and unprofessional use of

permission can take the advantage of Stealing user’s private data.

According to Enck et. al. (2011), the existing security permission model of android
has flaws that cannot protect the user’s private data effectively. Several researchers,
Ontang et. al. (n.d), questioned the Android security model, and stated that “the current

permission model cannot meet certain requirements’.

This proposal will conduct a study to detect the behavior of the malicious apps that
can manipulate information on android devices. As a solution we present a permission-
based scoring detection which will evaluate the permission of the application and

identify the application if it's malicious or not.

"Automated Course Scheduling using Local Search Based

","ABSTRACT

“AUTOMATED COURSE SCHEDULING USING LOCAL
SEARCH BASED SEARCH TECHNIQUE ALGORITHM”

A timetabling is a method of assigning events into a limited number of time
period and must satisfy a set of constraints of various types, which involve, among
others, avoiding the overlap of events with common participants, and not excessing
the capacity of rooms. These constraints are broken into two categories: soft and
hard constraints. Hard constraints are constraints, of which, in any occupied
timetable, there will be no breaches. Soft eoustraints are constraints which may be
shattered, but of which breaches must be minimized. In addition to constraints,
there are a number of exceptions which must be taken into consideration when
constructing an Automated Timetabling System. The College timetabling is a
special type of timetabling which is includes course timetabling or course
scheduling and examination timetabling.

The Course Scheduling Problem (CSP) is concerned with assigning a
number of courses to classrooms while taking into consideration constraints like
teacher and students preferences, classroom capacities and college rules and
conditions. The problem also attempts to optimize the performance criteria and
distribute the courses fairly to classrooms depending on the ratio of classroom

capacities to course enrolments. The difficulty in CSP is due to the various
associated constraints that need to be satisfied in order to produce better schedules.
A number of solution methods, analytical or heuristic approach, have been

proposed to solve the CSP.

In this research, timetabling system will resolve the (CSP) that academic
institutions face every year. By the use of an improved algorithm that significantly
produces better optimization results, conflicts will be prevented. The automated
scheduling system provides a choice of feasible schedules and solutions in which
examinations are well spread out for most students. It handles requirements
regarding the proximity of a student's courses, room or time availability, and other
factors. With the automated system, considerable reduction in clerical efforts is
attained. This can relieve the decision-makers from the burden of tedious and time-

consuming scheduling task to be done in every semester. This is how our system

all about.
","CHAPTER 1

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background and Rationale

Scheduling is a way of assigning events into a limited number of time
periods in such a way as to satisfy as many desirable objectives (Edmund Burke
and Sanja Petrovic, 2002). College course arrangement and scheduling is the
process of determining what courses to offer, how many sections are needed,
determining the best term to offer each section, assigning a faculty member to
instruct each section, and scheduling each section to a timeslot to avoid conflicts.
This process is typically broken down into three major phases: arrangement, faculty

assignment, and course scheduling.

Table 1. Arrangement and Scheduling Phases

This process is a very large, complex, and time consuming task with many
inputs to take into consideration. The quality of the output has an immense impact

on students, faculty, and the department as a whole. Poorly planned offerings can
impact student’s ability to take courses, class utilization, and student’s ability to
fulfill prerequisites. Poorly assigned faculty can impact the quality of instruction,
the satisfaction of faculty members, and student retention. Poorly scheduled
timetable can affect faculty’s ability to teach courses due to conflict, course
utilization, lab utilization, student satisfaction, faculty satisfaction, department
policies, and it can lead to undesirable last minute changes. This process partially
defines the lives of students and faculty members in terms of schedule and should
not be taken lightly. Because of the impact of this process it is important to
incorporate individual and group preference into as many areas of this process as
possible and to create a robust process that generates close to optimal solutions.
There has been research around course assignment and course timetabling
and many operations research techniques have been utilized to address these
problems, however often the techniques are tested, but rarely implemented as
shown by Carter and Lamporte (1998). Since much of the research focuses only on
generating a feasible schedule and appears to lack the preference drivers that are
valuable in creating a highly desirable schedule we felt there was room for further
research in this area. We have taken into consideration the preferences in this
research: faculty preference to teach a course, faculty preference for teaching time
of day. Additionally, this approach is unique because it takes a systems approach

by looking at the entire process instead of just one piece of the puzzle.
The Course Scheduling Problem also known as Class-Teacher Timetabling
Problem is the focus on this study. A timetabling is essentially a schedule which
must ponder a number of constraints. Constraints arc almost universally employed
by people dealing with timetabling problems (Burke and Ross, 1996).
Constraints can usually be divided into two types:
* Hard constraints have to be satisfied under any circumstances. For
example, in exam timetabling, two exams with common students involved
cannot be scheduled into the same timeslot. Timetables with no violations
of hard constraints are called feasible solutions.
¢ Soft constraints need to be satisfied as much as possible. For example, in
exam timetabling, exams taken by common students often need to be
spread out over the timeslots so that students do not have to sit in two
exams that are too close to each other. Due to the complexity of the real-
world timetabling problem, the soft constraints may need to be relaxed
since it is not usually possible to generate solutions without violating some

of them.

Thus, a timetable must meet a number of requirements and should satisfy
the desires of all people involved simultaneously as well as possible. The timing of
meetings must be such that nobody has more than one meeting at the same time. It

has been formulated in many and very different ways and has been solved using
several analytical or heuristic approaches the course timetabling problem. These
approaches include graph coloring (Neufeld and Tartar, 1974), genetic algorithms
(Colorni et al., 1990; Drexl and Salewski, 1997), constraint programming (Valouxis
and Housos, 2003), simulated annealing (Abramson, 1991), and other local search
algorithms (Costa, 1994; Schaerf, 1999).

Many formulations and algorithms have been proposed to solve course
scheduling problem and most of these algorithms are based on local search
techniques. The most common local search techniques are hill climbing, simulated
annealing, and tabu search. Many authors such as Gover and Laguna (1997),
Dowsland (1997), Colorni, Dorigo and Maniezzo (1998), and Feldman and
Golumbic (1990) had tested and claimed that Tabu Search is flexible and efficient
and yields a very good result among all local search based search technique
algorithms.

The tabu search (Gaspero and Schaerf, 2006) is a local search strategy based
on memory. At each states si, tabu search explores a subset Vof the current
neighborhood N (si). Among the elements in V, the one that gives the minimum
value of the cost function becomes the new current state si + 1, independently of
the fact whether f (si + 1) is less or greater than f (si). Such a choice allows the
algorithm to escape from local minima, but creates the risk of cycling among a set

of states.
In order to prevent the risk of cycling, the so-called tabu list is used, which
determines the prohibited moves. The simplest way to run the tabu /ist is that when
anew move is added to the list, the unscheduled move is discarded. There is a more
general mechanism that assigns to each move that enters the list a random number
of iterations, ranging from min to max (the values min and max are parameters
of the method), that it should be kept in the tabu list. However, these algorithms
can produce quality solutions but often have a considerable and enormous
computational time or very slow (Burke and Petrovic, 2002).

To overcome the inadequacies of solution approaches mentioned above, we
incorporate the single move as a neighborhood operator for the search technique,
one can change the value of just one variable in order to improve or reduce the
searching time as well as to generate better timetable (Lourenco, Marti and Stitzle,
1996; 2001; 2003). The single-move can create two alternative neighborhoods by
means of simple move, that is, a solution is obtained by using current faculty
available time slots to schedule new course.

This algorithm is similar to local search methods; however, in contrast to
classical local search techniques, it operates over feasible, though not necessarily
complete, solutions. In these solutions, some soft constraints are left unsatisfied
while hard constraints must be satisfied. Such solutions are easier to visualize and

more meaningful to human users than complete but infeasible solutions. Because
of the iterative character of the algorithm, the decision maker can also easily start,
stop, or continue from any feasible solution, either complete or incomplete.
Moreover, local scarch is a meta-heuristic technique for solving
computationally hard optimization problems. Local search can be used on problems
that can be formulated as finding a solution maximizing a criterion among a number
of candidate solutions. It moves from solution to solution in the space of candidate
solutions (the search space) until a solution deemed the optimal schedule is found
or a time bound is elapsed. An optimal schedule is one which meets the objective

better than any other schedule: even if not all of the constraints of the tasks are met.

"PAM: SPOKEN DIALOG SYSTEM USING NATURAL LANGUAGE
PROCESSING
","ABSTRACT

Pam is a spoken dialogue system aimed to help college students deal with
distress. Pam uses natural language processing to understand the user speech.
It uses Automatic Speech Recognizer (ASR) to receive the phonetics input. The
ASR processes the phonetics data to generate a text which it passes to the
Dialogue Manager (DM). The DM processes the text in order to formulate a
sentence as an output. The dialogue manager has phases, the Lexical, Parsing
and Discourse. Where in the lexical phase, the data is being tokenized or
chunked as a preparation for the next phases. The next process is part of speech
tagging or POS-tagged. In here, the data that are being chunked are labeled with
corresponding POS-tag. The next phase is parsing. With the help of parsing the
sentence structure is being check as a part of syntactic analysis to generate an
abstract tree. The abstract tree is used in semantic analysis to come up the best
possible meaning that the user tries to convey. From parsing, the data undergo
in discourse to check the previous input if it has a connection. As the meaning of
the sentence is identified, it passed to the next phase which is the Inference

Engine, where it generates a logical result with the help of logical test. The data

from IE is passed to TTS module to finally deliver an audible output.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background of the Study

In Wikipedia, A computer system that is able to converse with a human
with voice is called Spoken Dialogue System (SDS). SDS is commonly used in
telecommunication, web applications, and desktop applications as well as in
android applications. It has two components: The module that implements
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is called the speech recognizer. Its goal is
to receive the user’s speech and generate as output a recognition hypothesis,
which is the sequence of words that most likely corresponds to what the user has
Said and the module that converts text into spoken voice output is called Text to
Speech (TTS).

SDS varies on its complexity. Directed dialogue systems are very simple
and require that the developer creates a graph that manages the task but may
not correspond to the needs of the user. Information access systems, typically
based on forms, allow users some flexibility but are limited in their Capabilities.
Problem-solving dialogue systems may allow human users to engage in a
number of different activities that may include information access, plan
construction and possible execution of the latter. These systems allow users to
interact with a machine to retrieve information, conduct transactions, or perform
other problem-solving tasks, entertainment and even chatting.

Moreover, Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the scientific study of

languages from computational perspective and a field of computer science and
linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human
natural languages (Kumar, 2011). NLP is a branch of artificial intelligence that
has many important implications on the ways that computers and humans
interact. NLP technologies assist machines in understanding the language used
by humans to communicate both reading and writing. This form of
communication assists the computer in performing various other additional tasks
such as in healthcare services. It can increase its effectiveness through the use
of applications that are able to interact with and collect information from patients
and clinical and administrative staff. These could come either in the form of
mobile applications that present us with a virtual assistant or virtual human
(similar to Siri, Cortana or other applications), from which possibly in the form of
kiosks that patients or users sit in front of. In order to accomplish features of
apparent intelligence, an expert system relies on two components: a knowledge-
based and an inference engine. A knowledge-based is an organized collection of
facts about the system’s domain. An inference engine interprets and evaluates
the facts in the knowledge based on order to provide an answer (Zwass, 2016).

In 2015, the American College Health Association (ACHA) organized a
research survey called ACHA-National College Health Assessment Il (ACHA-
NCHA II) to assist college health service providers, health educators, counselors,
and administrators in collecting data about their students’ habits, behaviors, and
perceptions on the most prevalent health topics. Within the last 12 months,

students reported the following factors affecting their individual academic
performance. Based on the results, 30.3% of 19,861 respondents reported that
stress strongly affects individual’s performance.

With the undeniable truth how stress are being experienced by the people

especially the college students, it should not stay that way because it could lead
to a more serious condition that could affect student's academic and life
performance. Stress is being characterized as a negative emotional state in
response to circumstances or situations that exceed a person's ability to control
them (James, W., & McLane, M. 2013). There are three types of stress: Eustress
is the good stress, neustress is a stress that has no consequential effect and
distress is considered as the bad and often is abbreviated simply as stress. It is
the unfavorable or negative interpretation of an event which can be real or
imagined only (Seaward, 2006).

Talking about your distress can help you come to terms with it. It can
foster bonding and connectedness, which supports and heals. Talking about your
feelings can significantly help you through any distressing time in your life,
including a Dark Night (Lunden, 2012). If this communication becomes defective
or faulty, it often leads to stress. Poor communication can be a source of anger,
disagreements, distance in relationships and misunderstandings which, if
corrected can result in a stronger relationship and a happier future (Scott, 2011).

By creating a virtual human system where users can talk about their

distress, the researchers thought that it would serve as an effective catharsis in

coping with distress and encourage patients or users to seek for professional
assistance if needed since today’s generation are indisputable in being

comfortable with technology and intractable in seeking professional health.
Furthermore, Virtual humans (VHs) that can develop intimacy with people

are now becoming reality. Researchers have Successfully incorporated social

skills (e.g., active listening, mimicry, gestures) into VH systems (Bickmore et al.,

2005; Gratch, Kang, & Wang, 2013; Gratch et al., 2007). Indeed, compared to

their predecessors, VH with such social Skills increase feelings of connection and
rapport (the experience of harmony, fluidity, synchrony, and flow felt during a

conversation; Gratch et al., 2013). VHs can also provide a “safe” environment,

which could encourage users to have honest disclosure of important information.

INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background of the Study

One of the containment strategies for Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
pandemic, an infectious disease caused by a new coronavirus that was first
identified in Wuhan, China, is the isolation or quarantine of infected and
potentially exposed individuals under strict surveillance and monitoring to track
and predict its host adaptation, evolution, and transmissibility (Sohrabi et al.,

2020).

However, manual and close monitoring is a rigorous, time-consuming
and risky task. It's also difficult to discern the difference of COVID-19 from other
existing diseases since the most common symptoms such as fever and cough
are also associated with other known conditions (Larsen et al. 2020), resulting
in misinformation and wrong assumption. Additionally, close monitoring can
lead to direct exposure to COVID-19, which could mean transmitting the
disease, infecting others, and limiting the number of medical experts and
response teams (Recuenco 2020). For these reasons, the availability of a tool

for digital monitoring and risk prediction would be an effective method in the

early recognition of the COVID-19.

Prediction can be achieved through the use of Machine Learning

methods (Ahamad et al. 2020). Machine Learning, a sub-field of Artificial
Intelligence, provides computer systems the ability to learn and improve from
experience using data mining. Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD), also
referred to as data mining, is an intensive process to extract helpful data
patterns from massive data (Taranu 2015). Apriori algorithm can find
association rules in the retrieved data patterns (Rouse, Lutkevich, and Labbe
2017). Then, the association rules can be used in an attempt to predict the next
possible occurrence of a data item. In addition, Naive Bayes Classifier can
predict the likelihood of phenomena to occur or not based from the given data
patterns. The integration of these two methods can amplify the discovery of

significant knowledge (Nwagu et al. 2017).

The researchers propose to develop Safewatch, a prototype Quarantine
Symptom-Monitoring Web Application with Knowledge Discovery Using Naive
Bayes Classifier Based on Apriori Algorithm, with the primary purpose of

predicting the level COVID-19 risk exposure of an individual, whether it's high

or low.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background of the Problem

Detection of micron-sized particles at low concentrations remains a
challenge for many industries and applications, especially in the
pharmaceutical industry urban and industrial areas. There are many types
of technology used in discovering bacteria’s from motion, sounds, emitting
electromagnetic radiation, mixing chemicals, and others. According to
(Pawankumar Fakatkar (Engineering & Nagar, n.d., 2015)) To count the
colony counting system is used to count the number of colonies; this is a
time-consuming method that requires manually counting the colonies. This
type of system is susceptible to mistakes, and by using MATLAB (matrix
laboratory), with the time they were registered, circular colonies can be
easily identified.

MATLAB (matrix laboratory) has evolved over the years with input from
many users. Other image processing algorithms are used nowadays, such
as ImageJ (Java-based image processing program) and many others.

The proponent decides to design a Bacteria Particle Counter system, a
processing image of bacteria using PyTorch and Neural Network Algorithm.

of algorithms that attempt to identify underlying relationships in a set of data
using a mechanism that resembles natural language processing how the
human brain operates. In this sense, neural networks refer to systems of
neurons, either organic or artificial. Since neural networks can adapt to
changing data, they can produce the best possible outcome with minimal
effort redesigning the output criteria. With this research, the researcher can

1.1 Background of the Study

COVID-19 is a pandemic that has affected over 170 countries around
the world. The number of infected and deceased patients has been increasing
at an alarming rate. According to Gitanjali R. Shinde et al (2020) Forecasting
is essential to control infectious disease, but according to the epidemiologists
in Atlanta, Georgia, United States they have not yet succeeded in finding a

proper method.

Early forecasts of important information such as peaks in incidence and
spatial spread of the infection would enable decision-makers to act sooner

and minimize the damage to society once a disease outbreak is detected.

The recent statistics indicate that the number of people diagnosed with
COVID-19 is increasing exponentially, According to John Elflein (2020), the
total number of cases has reached over 54 million, with around 1.3 million
death. In this study, the researchers analyze the incidence of COVID-19

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background of the Study

In recent years, a vast number of papers have become accessible on the internet,
and the quantity continues to expand dramatically over time, resulting in an information
overload problem. Hence, reading only the most necessary information and skipping
the unimportant portions in a short amount of time may help readers save time and
effort while reading several ""summarized"" papers over a certain topic (Alomari et al.,
2022). With the expansion of the internet and big data, we have vast number of papers
kept in the form of images, resulting in the digitalization of resources in many
industries. Recent image processing research has demonstrated the significance of

image content retrieval (Kaundilya et al., 2019).

Manual writing and summarizing the image document are often costly and time-
consuming to produce. You must read the entire document to grasp the point before
summarizing it. According to Vilca & Cabezudo., 2017, Manual summarization is a
costly job that takes a significant amount of time and effort. In practice, humans find it
extremely difficult to manually summarize this massive volume of textual data. Since
this is an image document, the information contained within it is not searchable or
editable. That means you have lots of frozen text. This kind of information affects your
ability to search or get a specific word or sentence quickly. Kaundilya et al., 2019 added

that numerous images are made every day by various groups such as students,
engineers, and physicians, based on their diverse demands. They may extract images
based on their primitive features or associated text. Text included in such images can
give useful information. For these reasons, automatic text summarization and image
text recognition would be an effective method for digitalizing and summarizing the

image documents.

Text summarization and image recognition are NLP (natural language
processing) and computer vision techniques used in machine learning. Text
summarization may be classified into two types: extractive and abstractive. The
extractive summarization concatenates the most essential sentences from the original
document without any change. Abstractive summaries, on the other hand, are totally
new phrases with the same meaning as the original document's concepts (Bhargava &
Sharma, 2020). Luhn's algorithm is a TF-IDF-based extractive summarization method.
Based on their frequency, it only picks the most important phrases. A larger weight is
placed on the first few words of the document. (Rafferty, 2018) TS transformer is a
model for abstractive summarization. It implies that it will rewrite sentences as required
rather than simply taking them directly from the source text.(Goutham, 2020) Tesseract
OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is a technique used to extract text and characters

from images. This allows us to save our records and data digitally and securely (Tiwari,

2021).

The researchers would like to propose a prototype model of Image text
recognition with text summarization using Tesseract OCR, Luhn's algorithm, and

the TS transformer model, The main purpose is to assist readers in speeding up
the process of digitalizing and summarizing the image document by allowing

them to digitalize and summarize the text from the image in the system.

"INFORMATION RETRIEVAL CHATBOT FOR SCHOOL

","ABSTRACT

In this time of the pandemic, most of our daily tasks that have been traditionally
done in person have been overhauled to a digital and online platform. Answering
queries from the majority of customers in large businesses has been a norm, in most
cases, it is catered by people who are specifically hired for that role. In this paper, the
researchers proposed a chatbot prototype using Natural Language Processing and
Information Retrieval that could assess customers’ questions in a specific sub-
organization of an educational institution, namely ACLC College of Butuan's
Admission Department. The majority of today's chatbots are utilized for a single
purpose: information retrieval. This type of bot is intended to offer human-like
responses without the need for human intervention. Here, the system tries to figure out
what question you are attempting to ask, or, more realistically, which question from its
bank is closest to it, and responds appropriately (in this case, trained). Our proposed
design 1.) processes user questions through a natural language processing pipeline, then
2.) identifies keywords within the processed query. 3.) it would then find those
keywords in tagged data that it was trained for and retrieve the corresponding response.
4.) Finally, it would give that corresponding response to the user. The process proved
to be easy at first, but we ran into unexpected issues that would have delayed and
prolonged beyond what we had planned for our timeline. Nonetheless, the researchers
proved that this prototype chatbot would suffice and prove that the study is viable for

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background of the Problem

The COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) pandemic has had a significant
negative impact on economies and people of all ages and socioeconomic backgrounds.
Increased online business, educational, and economic activities have become the new
standard. The entire system of education, tertiary level through primary level, has failed
during the COVID-19 shutdown period not just in India, but also around the globe.
Face-to-face classes had to be suspended; therefore, classes could only be delivered
through online. It was decided that both synchronous and asynchronous types of
instruction would be used as a medium. Annotated PowerPoints and voice-over
narration from the teacher are also included in the asynchronous online training, in
addition to the transmission and keeping of readings and session materials on the LMS.
Individual tasks were developed from session activities and discussion assignments
with the inclusion of clearer directions and feedback. Social media and virtual
gatherings have evolved into the ""new normal” on a national and international level as
individuals attempt to preserve normalcy in their lives in spite of pandemic constraints.
Because of this problem, almost all establishments accept or consider this solution to

adopting online transactions like schools, hospitals, banks, and other companies.
Due to rising concems over the COVID-19 virus's spread and calls to control the
Corona virus, an increasing number of higher educational institutions have stopped
providing traditional in-person classes globally. The Corona virus has revealed
previously unknown flaws in educational institutions all over the world. As humanity
faces an unpredictable future, it is clear that society demands flexible and robust
educational systems and teaching practices now more than ever. Universities
throughout the world are undergoing substantial changes in how they function and
connect with their constituents because students and their families are seeking more
attention through numerous channels as well as quick response and service. According
to studies, the younger generation prefers chat services like WhatsApp, SMS, and
Facebook Messenger to phone calls or other direct person-to-person engagement
methods. We now communicate continuously at great volume and intensity using a
range of platforms, tools, and techniques. However, as technology advances, it is now
feasible to create user-friendly systems that converse with a variety of user populations

in the same way that humans would. (Lala Olusegun Gbenga, 2020).

Every day there may be inquiries that admissions officers cannot cater to all of the
questions. The Admissions office answers all the questions of the customers regarding
the school. Because of the COVID, the school was unable to add staff to address this
issue, and staff are limited to working at school, particularly if they are performing
skeletal work. The researchers attempt to find a solution to this problem; a solution that
deals with the lack of attention when answering questions. Now that almost all

transactions are online, the researchers thought of the solution of making a chatbot that
answers all inquiries onlinc, 24/7. Regarding this matter, this study (chatbot) will solve
the problem. Because the chatbot can operate on its own, it caters to the customers 24/7

without the need for additional staff at the Admission Office.

Chatbots are a viable approach for automating customer service, especially as
online chat is increasingly being utilized for customer service. Chatbots are not a novel
technology as they date back to ELIZA, which was developed by Joseph Weizenbaum
in 1966. However, recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, as
well as the increasing usage of messaging platforms, have prompted organizations to
consider chatbots as a supplement to customer service (Flstad A., Nordheim C.B., Bjrkli
C.A. 2018). In this age of the internet and the COVID-19 pandemic, more than ever,
communication is necessary, and everyday use of several internet-based
communication services is increasing. Chatbots have regularly been used to speed up
the process of replying to customer inquiries. Chatbots can comprehend your
communications and reply properly thanks to a process called natural language
processing (NLP). Natural language processing helps AI deliver the best answer by
providing context and meaning to text-based user inputs.(2020, Khrystyna Sarakhman,

Roman Kempnyk, and Vladyslav Chyhura).

Al-driven chatbots can understand natural human language, discern meaning and
emotion, and deliver smart responses as if a real human delivered it. Customers may
easily obtain responses to their concerns, for example, without being forced to wait in

phone lines or send numerous emails. They can lower the volume of client calls, the
typical handling time, and the cost of providing customer service (Mohammad

Nuruzzaman, Omar Khadeer Hussain, 2018),

Al-based chatbots can recognize meaning and emotion in natural language,
comprehend context, and provide thoughtful answers. As an instance, it helps
customers to swiftly get answers to their questions without having to wait in long phone

lines or send several emails. They can reduce phone volume, average handling times,

and customer service costs. (Gyérgy Molnar, Zoltan Sztits, 2018).

At the start of the current decade, chatbots started to appear in great numbers.
Online conversation has been swiftly invaded and taken over by interactive technology,
which is frequently integrated with artificial intelligence. Chatbots are used by
businesses, governments, and other organizations to advertise goods, services, and
ideas on websites, in apps, and on instant messaging systems. They are not merely
components of virtual assistants. The authors of this paper begin by providing a
theoretical and historical framework, then emphasize the issues with using chat bots as

teaching aids, and finally detail the core methods and obstacles of chat bot construction

(Gydrgy Molnar, Zoltan Sziits, 2018)

When it comes to responding to client’s questions that are regularly asked and
frequently answered, chatbots employed in customer service save a large amount of
time and resources for businesses. In hipher cducation settings, where students
frequently ask staff members about orgamzational and administrative matters, such a

technique is highly widespread. This ts also clearly visible during the difficult
admissions scason, when the admissions team is required to reply to inquiries from
countless numbers of curious high school students. Software programs called
conversational agents use natural language to have conversations that resemble those
between humans. In order to pass the Turing Test, they omitted information from users
making them think they were people in the 1960s. It was observed that allowing users
to convey their questions and interests organically by speaking, typing, or pointing
would boost and improve the overall user experience. (W. El Hefny et al. 2021). This
shows that chatbot is a good solution for answering questions of customers of a certain

school, especially questions for the Admissions office.

Now, in building the chatbot there are multiple ways of approaching it and one of
them is using Natural Language Processing. The backbone of chatbots, natural language
processing (NLP), has undergone numerous changes and evolved into many techniques
of how it processes and interprets human language. Chatbots can comprehend your
communications and reply properly thanks to a process called natural language
processing (NLP). Natural language processing (N LP) assists in providing context and
meaning to text-based user inputs in order for AI to deliver the best possible result.

(Khrystyna Sarakhman, Roman Kempnyk, Vladyslav Chyhura, 2020).

A chatbot can comprehend your communications and reply properly because of a
process called natural language processing (NLP). The chatbot may use its AI skills to
provide a suitable answer when you start a message with ""Hello,"" since the NLP directs
the chatbot that you provided a typical greeting. The chatbot will probably give a reply

greeting in this situation. Without the logic used in Natural Language Processing, a chat
bot cannot discern between the responses ""Hello"" and ""Goodbye."" ""Hello"" and
""Goodbye"" will both be text-based user inputs to a chatbot that lacks the use of Natural
language processing. It helps AI deliver the best answer by providing context and

meaning to text-based user inputs. (Casey Phillips, 2018).

In addition, the researchers will also use the Information Retrieval method in
building the chatbot. This method will retrieve NLP and understand the data needed
once the input of the user. This will serve as the final stage of processing the data to
answer the question of the user. In other terms, a database is an organized system of
storage that enables searching for objects within it based on predetermined criteria. The
technology that enables searching of databases to retrieve information stored within is
known as a search mechanism. Depending on the user's technical proficiency while
accessing the database, the complexity of the query techniques used varies. A regulated

vocabulary or “natural language"" can be used as the third element of an information

retrieval system. (Chu, 2005, p.16).

In conclusion, because of the need to be able to conduct and continue online
classes, all students come through with online enrollment/transactions. ACLC College
of Butuan adopts online transactions for the payment of tuition, enrollment, classes,
meetings, and inquiries or questions about the school. Now that almost all transactions
are online, the researchers thought of the solution of making a chatbot that answers all
inquiries online, 24/7. Regarding this matter, this study (chatbot) will solve the
problem. Because the chatbot can operate on its own, it caters to the customers 24/7

without the need for additional staff at the Admission Office.

INTRODUCTION

1.1. Rationale of the Study

In the present day, A lot of people dreamed of a machine which could
read characters and numerals, but it seems the first OCR (Optical Character
Recognition) device was developed in the late 1920s by the Austrian engineer
Gustav Tauschek (1899-1945), who in 1929 obtained a patent on OCR (so-
called Reading Machine) in Germany, followed by Paul Handel who obtained
a US patent on OCR (so-called Statistical Machine) in the USA in 1933 (U.S.
Patent 1915993). In 1935 Tauschek was granted a US patent on his machine
(U.S. Patent 2026329). Tauschek was a genius self-taught Viennese
engineer, with more than 200 patents in the computing field to his credit, who
used to work for IBM and who besides the first OCR device, invented also

many devices and systems for the punch-card machinery, as well as the
magnetic drum-memory. The Reading Machine of Tauschek was a
mechanical device, using template matching with a photodetector
(photoelectric cell, marked with 5 on the patent drawing). A picture containing
a text passed in front of the reading machine's window (marked with 1). The
comparison device was a disk (or a wheel, marked with 6) (which had holes in

the form of letters) rotating from the interior side of the objective lens (3). When

images and letter-shaped holes coincided in form, the click work rotated the

printing drum to the required letter, and this letter is printed on paper.

OCR traces its roots back to telegraphy. On the eve of the First World

War, physicist Emanuel Goldberg invented the machine that could read
characters and convert them into telegraph code. In the 1920s, he went a step
further and created the first electronic document retrieval system. At this time,
businesses were microfilming financial records — great in principle, but quickly
retrieving specific records from spools of the film was nigh on impossible. To
overcome this, Goldberg used a photoelectric cell to do pattern recognition
with the help of a movie projector. By repurposing existing technologies, he
took the first steps towards the automation of record keeping. The US patent
for his “Statistical Machine” was later acquired by IBM. Since then, OCR
technology has proliferated, with businesses all over the world relying on it to

help reduce overheads when it comes to converting and extracting data from

paper documents.

Therefore, we have decided to develop a web-based system that may
be of service of assisting the researcher or a user in which text images are
converted into machine-encoded text to provide Digitizing text means it can

be easily presented, edited, Stored, and searched.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study
The World Health Organization (WHO) defined health as a state of

complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the
absence of disease or infirmity (Kuhn, S. & Rieger, U.M., 2017). The
positive concept emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as
physical capacities (Haslam, S. A., & Reynolds, K. J., 2003). This means
that health is a resource to support an individual's function in wider
society (Sharma, M., 2016). A healthful lifestyle that provides the means
to lead a full life (Nordqvist, 2017). More recently, researchers have
defined health as the ability of a body to adapt to new threats and
infirmities (Bhattacharya, N., 2019). They based this the idea on the
modem science that it has dramatically increased human awareness of
diseases and how they work in the last few decades (Nordqvist, 2017).
One of the problems in health is monitoring blood pressure or
hypertension (Barnett, G. O., Winickoff, R. N., Morgan, M. M., & Zielstoff,
R. D., 1983). Blood pressure composed of two types such as systolic
pressure and diastolic pressure (Stamler, J., Stamler, R., & Neaton, J. D.,
1993). The systolic pressure is the force at which the heart pumps blood
around the body, While the diastolic pressure is the resistance of the

blood flow in the blood vessels (Illiades, 2009). A blood pressure reading

between 120/80mmhg and 140/90mmhg could mean you're at risk of
2

developing high blood pressure (Lloyd Jones, D. M., Larson, M. G.,

Beiser, A., & Levy, D.,1999).

The factors of having a blood pressure includes at the age of 65, being
overweight, have a family of high blood pressure, don’t do enough
exercise, drink too much alcohol or coffee, smoking, and don’t get much
sleep or have disturbed Sleep (Monk, 2019). According to Food Nutrition
Research Institute(FNRI), the National prevalence of hypertension among
Filipino adults is 20 years old and over had Significantly increased after a
decline in 2013 from 22.3% to 23.9% in 2015 (Aurel, 2018). The
Department of Health (DOH) also revealed that hypertension remains to
be a leading cause of illness and said to be one of the identified
Precipitating factors of premature death in the Philippines (Flores, 2018).
In 2017, DOH conducted a current national survey that the total number
of hypertensive Filipinos is more than 12 million with more than half of
them are unaware of their condition and one out of four to five Filipinos in
general (Orillo, 2018). Hypertension is also one of the top causes of
premature deaths worldwide and the problem is growing (Eriksson, H.,
1995). In 2025, the World Health Organization warned that an estimated
1.56 billion adults will be living with hypertension (Agdeppa, 2016). The
traditional way of checking blood pressure is that the doctors use a
sphygmomanometer to take systolic and diastolic measurement, the
phases when the heart pumps blood and then rest (Ormon Healthcare,

2018).

The proponents proposed a system wearable blood pressure
monitoring system using Arduino in generating status report through web
portal access. To be able to monitor and know the patient's status of their
blood pressure and in addition, is to keep them updated to their condition
every day. The user cannot get any hustle when they go outside of their
house since they can wear the device wherever they will go. The relatives
can monitor their patient even the patient is not in their house. Also by the
use of the system, it tracks the current location of the user through global
positioning system or GPS. The primary goal of this study as well is to

communicate information Clearly through the use of information applies.

1.2 Project Context

Wearable blood pressure monitoring system using Arduino in
generating status report through web portal access focuses on the
effective and convenient way to monitor the patient. It tends to help the
patient in a very accessible way to provide them good service and to keep
them updated of their status if it is in good condition. When the patient is
in bad condition, the proposed system will notify through web portal
access to determine what really happened to the patient. The mobile app
will notify to the user for a recommendation on what to do if their blood
Pressure is increased. Also it will track the patient through global

positioning system (GPS) in web to know where the patient's location.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

Book indexing has always been a method in making a list of discussed
topics in a book. According to Hesham (2016), a book index is simply a key to
locating information found in a book. It is a method to create indexes to
provide access to detailed contents of books. Library has a collection of
documents that undergo a procedure for cataloging the bibliographic records
composed of all the basic data within a book which are then selected to be
indexed and can serve as keywords to be accessed later on Pokorny (2018).
Book indexing is a pathway that guides the person searching for related
books. According to the CSU Librarian Assistant M.G. Reyes, the importance
of the book indexing is to serve as a primary source of information on certain
topics that the researchers needs.

Two types of techniques can be used for automated book indexing: (a)
Standalone or Dedicated tools, is one of the techniques that is usually applied
for back-of-the-book indexes which permits the indexers to work from page-
numbered galleys; and (b) automated indexing software which is a tool that
now paired with most word-processing software. The outcomes are a list of

words and phrases that are applicable in the early stages of making an index.

With the use of OCR, we can easily scan the back-of-the-book indexes.
It is less time-consuming and it will make the process of producing digitalized

book index more efficient. Optical character recognition/reader (OCR) is a
2

process of conversion of Images from scanned any type of printed documents

into a machine-coded text.

Regular Expression (RegEx) Is a concept of string pattern searching
that enable to find a sequence of character In a string. As stated by Friedl
(2006), in terms of manipulating string and bunch of data, regular expression
is one of the powerful tool used. By using Regex, string pattern and matching
became easily and handy for any purposes. By using RegEx, we can
manipulate a bunch of data that remove or lessen the load on the computer’s

processor.

1.2 Project Context

Books are essential part of human learning and few people cannot
imagine living without it. Books contain authoritative information and this can

include comprehensive accounts of research.

In ACLC College of Butuan Library, their method of digitalizing book
indexes is non-existent. Searching for book indexes falls to the librarian’s own
on the books available in the library. Librarians provide information on books
has always relied on searching the book indexes one-by-one just to provide
the correct book for the researchers needs. So, the Researchers proposed a
system entitled Book Indexing with Regular Expression String Pattern using
Optical Character Recognition. An automated book indexing used by the
librarian to produce a digitalized book indexes. This will enhance the
Capabilities of the library in terms of searching for topics that can help the

librarian and the People going to the library.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

At present time, individuals have adjusted in modernization increases in
doing their errands. The day by day substantial outstanding task at hand and
schedules make it hard for individuals to deal with their time. With existing and
advancing innovations these days, from machines to apparatuses and cell
phones, individuals have turned to lead everyday tasks intelligently and

electronically.

The Internet of Things (loT) has been in the spotlight for the past decade. It
is regarded as one of the disruptive technologies of this century and so far, has
caught the attention of society, industry and academy as a way of
technologically enhancing day to day activities, the creation of new business
models, products and services, and as a broad source of research topics and
ideas. Several alliances, institutions, enterprises and even governments have
understood its importance and identified the potential benefits that can be
obtained from the loT, leading them to undertake strategic projects and

initiatives aiming to develop this field and profit from it (Alkhatib, 2017)

In agricultural matters, having a pig farm business arises many problem.
The manual feeding of pigs was not an easy task to do. To make it easier to the
person having pig farms, pig monitoring and automated feeding must be

utilized. A pig monitoring and automated feeding consist of a hardware that
2

monitors the pig and automatically refill the feeding place. It also have a mobile

application in order to notify the user.

Therefore, the researcher decided to develop An Automated Pig Feeding
with Depth Analysis using Computer Vision to solve the problem. It has a
prototype that mechanically feed the pigs in the set time and refills the water
automatically along with the computer vision, it is a module that provides the

Parameter of the study.
1.2 Project Context

Piggery is a branch of animal husbandry that raises Pigs as livestock.
Most of piggery uses manual process when it comes to feeding and monitoring.
Due to a large population of pigs it become more complex to the farmers to
monitor and feed their pigs. As piggery becomes more in demand and as a
source of income nowadays, people become more interested in this kind of
business.

An automated pig feeding with Depth Analysis using Computer Vision is
developed to minimize the workload of the farmer. The system can
automatically feed the pigs and refill its water container. Using OpenCV it can
determine the sizes of the pigs. It can also notify the farmer by sending the

water level data if it is empty and needed to refill.

","INTRODUCTION

In this chapter are the rationale of the study, project context, purpose

and description, objectives of the study, scope and limitation.

1.1 Rationale of the Study

Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) was
established through the enactment of Republic Act. No. 7796, empowers
TESDA to establish and maintain a system of accrediting, coordinating,
integrating, monitoring and evaluating formal and non-formal technical
vocational education and training programs. The National Certificate, is an
important document needed to present in applying jobs here and abroad, it is
a graduate’s proof that her or she has passed all the trainings and

requirements set by the TESDA.

The TESDA Director Guiling Mamondiong in the year 2017 said that they
conducted inspection of training centers and they found out that sometimes
they are just sending their substitutes to train the students. Aside from that,
the assessors and trainers are being pirated by other departments. Based on
this matter the proponents decided to conduct a research and studies which
leads them to create the An Implementation of TESDA Competency-Based

Training Delivery Transaction Management System.

The training of TESDA has been managed and they conducted a

registration for the trainees and trainers. The trainers can monitor his or her
trainees all the time but they cannot monitor on time which of those trainees

are behind and need of their attention.

Therefore, the proponents’ decided to develop An Implementation of
TESDA Competency-Based Training Delivery Transaction Management
System to give them an easy way to manage their trainers and trainees. They
can managed who is that trainee that have been left behind and what part of
the Unit Competency (UC) were they consumed so much time. The system
can auto generate the other works of the trainers like checking directly the

achievement charts and the progress chart instead of manual.

1.2 Project Context

The assessment of TESDA is important for graduates as it is where they
could get a national certificate (NC) if they passed. Most of assessment in this
institution used a manual process when it comes to monitor a trainee, to
check their achievement chart, progress chart and the daily training matrix

and also to manually do their pre-test and post-test.

In order to manage An Implementation of TESDA Competency-Based
Training Delivery Transaction Management System was developed to
automate the system so that the trainer can focus the trainees. The said
system can easily monitor both trainees and the trainer. Also, the said system
can automatically check the achievement chart and the progress chart if the
trainee done with their job. The said system can give them the access to do

their pre-test and post-test on time. The office of TESDA can also monitor the

trainer and the trainees.

","ABSTRACT

The COVID-19 pandemic is causing a global health epidemic. The most
powerful safety tool is to observe physical distancing, wearing of facemask and
checking of body temperature. The outbreak forced high-occupancy offices to cater to
a smaller population to deter the transmission of the virus. HEALRTH: An Automated
COVID-19 Response Implementing the Minimum Public Health Standards in High
Occupancy Offices has been developed to provide an automated solution amid the
COVID-19 spread. This study mainly focuses on implementing the rules governed by
the Department of Health (DOH) against COVID-19. Using the System Development

Life Cycle (SDLC) as a method in developing the system, to guide the proponents
throughout the development. The proponents used the Flask Framework in Python to
successfully develop the web application, Tensorflow and OpenCV for the surveillance
device, and the GPIO for the entrance prototype. The following electronic components
and technologies were utilized: Raspberry Pi 3 B+ as the microcontroller, MLX90614
which is the contactless temperature sensor; 1602 Display as an LED display; Servo
motor emits the gate; Ultrasonic sensor which checks a person on passing, webcam
used in streaming the facemask and distance detection; breadboard; buzzer, speaker,
jumper wires, and led lights. The proponents carefully analyzed all the necessary data
gathered from the data gathering, field observation, and internet sources, and conducted
a survey to assess the quality of the system—to twenty-five (25) respondents, composed
of seven (7) frontliners and eighteen (18) civilians. The result gathered a 4.66 total
mean, which is equivalent to highly acceptable. Developed system embedded with a

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

A pandemic is a disease outbreak that spans several countries and affects many
people. There have been many significant disease outbreaks and pandemics recorded
in history, including Spanish Flu, Hong Kong Flu, SARS, H7N9, Ebola, Zika (WHO,
2011b). The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an
ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Estimates of the most recent
common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 date the epidemic between late November 2019 and
the beginning of December 2019, which is compatible with the first reported cases
discovered in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, during the recent epidemic of pneumonia
in January 2020 (Huang C, Wang Y, Li X, et al., 2020; Zhou P, Yang XL, Wang XG,
et al., 2020). Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may present symptoms ranging from
mild to severe, with a large portion of the population being asymptomatic carriers. The
most common reported symptoms to include fever (i.e., a body temperature >37.5 °C)
is about (83%), cough (82%), and shortness of breath (31%) (Wang D, Hu B, Hu C, et
al., 2020). The significance of viral transmission via small airborne micro-droplets (also
commonly referred to as ‘aerosols’) has been intense discussed in the context of the

SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 (severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus-

2/coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic (Morawska and Cao, 2020). Respiratory droplet
is one of three commonly accepted modes of viral transmission.
Countries have taken stringent restrictions such as vacation for schools, working

from home, quarantine for regions with a high number of cases, and most importantly,
=

lockdown to slow down the COVID 19 outbreak. Given that SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks
might remain a possibility for a long time, societies need to develop alternatives to a
strict lockdown that allow for a safe life with the virus even though neither effective
treatment nor a vaccine is available. Mandated face mask use is a non-pharmaceutical
intervention that is potentially very potent in combating COVID-19 (Eikenberry et al.,
2020; Mitze et al., 2020). Another critical dimension is to observe distancing in
community settings. An experiment in Italy shows that wearing a face mask can
substantially improve adherence with the physical distancing regulations on pavements
both in the absence of a mask mandate and after its introduction (Seres et al., 2020;
Marchiori, 2020). Capacity control goes hand in hand with social distancing, in its
importance is explained as a method to minimize crowds and thus avoid the spread of
the disease within groups of people, and the way this has been a common practice in
previous generations (F. Aslam, 2020). The correlation between high temperature and
COVID-19 infection is so strong that several governments have imposed screening
protocols involving a body temperature check at the entrances to hospitals, airports,
train stations, churches, schools, shops, sports centers, offices, etc. (Stella, A.B.;
Manganotti, P.; Furlanis, G.; et al. 2020). Very few countries have managed to keep it
well-controlled, but one of the critical tools that several such countries use is contact
tracing (K. T. Eames and M. J. Keeling, 2003).

The national government in the Philippines have implemented large-scale
policies to control this pandemic to their respective offices, local government units
(LGU) had imposed granular policies and real-time interventions to address differences
in the local COVID-19 transmission (S. Talabis, D.A., Babierra, A.L., H. Buhat, C.A.
et al., 2021). To impose these granular policies, offices were assigning their security

personnel to implement the minimum public health standards to their office operation.
Since these restrictions are measurable, the reasons that trigger the proponents
to extinguish the idea are to help the offices and their security personnel to implement
the minimum public health standards, The proponents propose developing a web-based
system that uses the Python Flask framework to manage the information which serves
us a scheduling system and a contract tracing system. Emerge with an entrance device
that has a camera module for validation of the QR code, a temperature sensor that
checks the body temperature of the person before entering, and a servo motor serving
as a turnstile gate. And an indoor surveillance device that is using OpenCV and Keras
on top of Tensorflow to monitor and prompt persons to wear their facemask and observe

social distancing.

1.2 Project Context

In this phenomenon of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been hard for the offices
to adjust directly to the current situation, significantly as it affects the operation of the
office. The proponents decided to gather data in a form of observation and talk to
random persons about their experiences encountered in the accommodation of the
offices. The proponents observed three (3) huge public offices in Butuan City for over
four (4) hours observation in three (3) consecutive days. The three offices that had been
observed are Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) office, the PhilHealth office, and the
Social Security System (SSS) office which visibly have the volume of visitors. As the
proponents execute the observation these three (3) offices are strictly implementing the
minimum public health standards to their respective offices; where the person needs to
follow social distancing protocol from arriving at the entrance until to the provided
seats, check the body temperature of each person, and the person must fill-up the

profiling and health declaration slip. The PSA and SSS are using the numbering

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

The Covid-19 pandemic dramatically changed the world. With the onset of a
novel virus, the world was halted—different sectors (e.g., education, business, travel,
Etc.) had to stop operating and strictly follow health protocols to contain the virus. By
2020, people worldwide had to live with the new normal, observing social distancing,
isolation, and quarantine. The pandemic caused massive disorders in the daily lifestyle
and travel behaviors worldwide (Cannon, 2020). Some of these behavioral changes are
restrictive measures imposed by the Government to ensure that the health protocols
are well followed even in traveling. According to the Department of Health (2021), all
persons shall wear well-fitted face masks and face shields, if necessary, especially in
public areas and enclosed spaces. Mandatory use of a face shield on top of face masks
shall be done in high-risk activities under the 3C's (Closed, Crowded, and Close
contact) framework. Local governments require citizens who recently traveled to get
tested and quarantined for up to 14 days. Individuals who are fully vaccinated are not
required to be isolated after contact with someone who has covid unless they have
symptoms. However, fully vaccinated individuals need to be tested 5-7 days after their
exposure, even if they do not have symptoms, and wear masks for the duration of the
quarantine period or until their test result is negative. If the traveler travels by bus or
van and is unvaccinated, be aware that sitting or standing within 6 feet (2 meters) of
others for a prolonged period can put you at higher risk of getting or spreading

COVID-19. With the danger of COVID-19 still looming over the country, travel
restrictions are still in effect in many local government units (LGU), and applying for
a travel pass is a bit of a hassle for most.

According to Pinky Concha-Colmenares (2021), much preparation is needed to
get all the travel documents together when you plan to travel nowadays, depending on
the local government unit (LGU) of your destination. She recently drove down to a
town in Antique to attend to an urgent family matter and had to show four documents
to each person who asked for their papers in every port they passed. The four
documents are the S-pass, the result of the RTPCR test, which should be negative, the

letter of acceptance from the LGU of the town, and a health declaration required by

the province of Aklan for all travelers passing through. And a photocopy of a

government-issued ID. Preparing these documents requires time because the RT PCR

test should be taken 72 hours before the intended arrival. A traveler can apply for the
S-pass only after getting a negative result on the test. Next, travelers must coordinate
with the LGU of their destination to get the ""notice of acceptance,"" which requires the
result of the RTPCR test. An added requirement is the health declaration from the
province of Aklan, which she had to apply online from their website for the ""Online
health declaration card."" With the two documents, travelers must go back to the S-pass

website and submit the documents. The traveler can get their S-pass with their QR
code when approved.

The above mentioned issue encouraged the proponents to develop a proposed
design for developing an online platform that allows the residents of the Caraga region
to process their travel pass online and store it on their smartphones using a QR code.
With the development of technology, and society adapting to the new normal, people
have smartphones and access to the Internet. The travel pass information system is a

project intended for managing the travel pass requirements of the local government
14

units in the entire Caraga. Securing travel passes becomes a lot easier and can be done
hassle-free. The information and the requirements of a traveler will be entered into the
system along with the attached evidence, like photos and scanned documents proving

that all the requirements he/she has submitted are valid and legitimate (Macatangay,

2021).

For a ""Web-based travel pass information system with QR code in the Caraga
Region"" to be developed, the proponents must know about the state of alert level of
LGUs and the requirements to travel. The proponents must also know how the QR
code works and how to integrate the information system and QR code they are trying

to make. They also need to have enough experience developing the project using a

programming language of their choice.

1.2 Project Context

The proponents proposed a web-based travel pass information system with a
Quick Response (QR) code in Caraga Region to secure travel passes hassle-free and

more accessible using the Internet than traditional paper documents (Garcia & Mobo,

2020).

According to Wego Travel, a travel pass is a response to the following
challenges: Complexity and variety, the wide range of COVID-19 tests, and the varied
requirements of local government units, have created a rather challenging setting
wherein travelers, airlines, and immigration authorities struggle to navigate. With
insufficient information, travelers are often confused and need accurate and reliable
communication with no clue where to find them. Errors in the levels of entry
requirements may lead to confusion as check-in agents attempt to verify multiple

non-accredited test certificates presented by travelers. It may eventually lead to

ABSTRACT

Covid-19 is a pandemic disease that erupted and exploded at the end
of 2019.The start of 2020. Centered on the WHO's declaration (World Health
Organization), the virus has now spread to more than 20 nations and
territories around the world. The Covid19 virus spreads mainly by saliva
droplets or nose discharge.

Studies have been conducted for monitoring local residence accessing
establishments as an aid for contact tracing and data analytics; these studies
are to control the spreading of Covid-19 or known as “CoronaVirus disease.""
Also, this study focused on the QR code that is used to access people
entering the establishments. The proponent used Model Agile planning,
designing, planning, construction, testing, and implementation. In designing
the system, the advocates used the Agile Approach to comply with the system
specifications. If the first step is finished, the promoter can not proceed to the
next step, but he will move backward from the previous step if there will be
any adjustments.

In this approach, QR codes are issued by Barangay Officials’ in local
areas. The code does not retrieve the users' location data; instead, it has
three colors, black, red, and blue, that represent which scheduled people are
allowed to enter the establishments. Each code has a unique ID to identify if
the person is authorized to enter an establishment. This approach can serve
as a reliable solution to the public crisis on this pandemic.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background of the Study

The covid-19 is a pandemic disease that exploded at the end of 2019 and
the beginning of 2020. Based on WHO (World Health Organization) statement,
the virus has now spread to over 20 countries and territories worldwide. The
covid19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the
nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes. A novel strain of coronavirus
was rst detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, a city in China.

In these days of an outbreak, many have studied contact tracing to
prevent the spreading of COVID-19; for this reason, the contact tracing has been
presented using smartphones, Bluetooth connectivity, or GPS location history of
performing the contact tracing. Also, developing a BubbleBox system composed
of a wearable device, a wristband, to Under the protected social gap between the
person who wears it and other people, trace all contacts. The wristband is
responsible for outlining the connections- it generates a unique id.

However, The DOH (Department of Health) 13 (CARAGA) has conrmed
local transmission of the coronavirus disease 2019 after reporting new infections
in Butuan City. Due to these developments, Local Government Units (LGUs)

strictly implement the health protocols to contain the spread of Covid-19. To
reduce the chance of propagation of the 2019-NCOV, the city government of
Butuan has issued a new color-coding scheme to control the movement of

people. The color-coding quarantine pass, residents carrying black colored
quarantine passes can go out only on Monday and Tuesday. Residents with
Blue quarantine passes can only go out on Tuesday and Friday. At the same
time, those with Red quarantine passes can go out on Wednesday and Saturday

enough to control the spreading of coronavirus. Based on this matter, the
proponents decided to conduct research and studies, which leads them to create
a system application for monitoring local residence accessing to establishments

","ABSTRACT

This study concentrates on ""Kolek"" An Outdoor Mini Rover Surveillance Camera
with Foul Smell Collecting Features Using Raspberry Pi. The study's objective was to
collect animal waste outdoors to reduce human exposure to it, keep the environment
clean, assist farmers in producing fertilizer, and assist people in avoiding health issues
that may result from exposure to animal waste and its dead bodies. The study's
researchers developed a prototype that will rove throughout the offices, departments,
and backyard of the house because it contains a security camera to record what happens
outside. The small rover is seeking dead animals and feces while it is roving. If the
sensor has already detected animal feces, the mini rover's hand will reach down and
collect them, along with any dead animals, and place them in its tank. It is necessary to
evaluate the newly developed prototype's usability, functionality, reliability, and
efficiency. The prototype was created using the Waterfall Development Model
Methodology, and it was then turned into hardware that would help and offer a solution
to the issue of animal waste that affects people's health and gets rid of the bad smell in
the air, especially for those who are unwilling to properly dispose of their animals’ waste
and dead bodies. Devices like the Raspberry Pi, MQ-136 Sensor, and Pi Camera were
used in the prototype. The prototype also included a mobile application to preview the

INTRODUCTION

Found in this chapter are the study’s rationale, project context, the objectives of

the study, and the scopes and limitations

1.1 Rationale of the Study

People don't commonly doubt the large importance of hearing and vision in their
lives. Still, it's not uncommon for folks of disagree in talking concerning the importance
of the sense of smell/odor. Smell-producing product activities square measure a typical
a part of our daily lives and have an effect on each outside and indoor air quality. (Brian
Rohrig, 2016). Unpleasant odors from animal waste and fauna bodies are thought-about
indicators or warning signs indicating possible hazards to human health however not
essentially direct causes of negative health impacts. However, national Counsel for
complaints to public health organizations that odors might not merely function a caution
about possible dangers however that odor perceptions themselves could result in health
issues. A number of the health symptoms square measure induced of headache, nausea,
diarrhea, hoarseness, cough, chest tightness, nasal congestion, palpitations, shortness
of breath, tension, drowsiness, and mood swings are some of the symptoms. (Susan S.
Schiffman et al., 2015). there's additionally a positive impact on the farms wherever the
farmers used the waste and dead bodies of the animals as chemical to enhance the

fertility of cropland. it's a superb supply of nutrients to support the expansion of crops

(Fu et al., 2016),
According to the study of ATSDR, 2015, most out of doors odors that may

cause health symptoms to the shape come back from several sources. Still, the highest

of the list is that the animals' BM and therefore the dead bodies of animals that humans

don't mind eliminating properly. Humans square measure exposed to pathogens from
poorly managed animal BM, significantly in communities wherever animals live about
to humans, particularly dogs and cats. Some dog and cat homeowners not removing

dog BM from the road might represent a haul for hygiene and public health ""Environ,""

2013. consistent with Sheshe Giddens, 2020, animal BM and animals’ dead bodies
might contain odorless gases, like N, oxygen, hydrogen, carbonic acid gas, methane,
and, lastly, sulfide. sulfide (H2S) features a distinctive smell of rotten eggs. This gas

is made by bacteria's organic matter breaking down anaerobically, a typical element
of ""sewer gas.” however this gas doesn't cause disease; instead, once This substance's

molecules enter your nose, where they will attack the central systema nervosum. Our
sense of smell typically alerts USA to potential danger. unhealthy smells will function
a warning that one thing is wrong. if the odor unhealthy, it's in all probability unhealthy
for you. additional typically than not, the nose is aware of (Brian Rohrig, 2016).
consistent with Gauthami Penakalapti et al., 2017, humans square measure at risk if
exposed to animal BM. The animal's dead bodies are related to diarrhea, soil-
transmitted worm infection eye disease, environmental enteric pathology, and growth
faltering
Since these accidents may be preventable that we tend to square measure
already in AN innovative generation, the proponents determined to propose a study

that the there's a mini rover to fetch the animal BM out of doors so we will scale back
the human exposure to the animal BM with the employment of high-end innovative

technology entitled, ""KOLEK"" an outside mini Rover police work Camera with Foul
Smell assembling options exploitation Raspberry Pi.” a tool which will modify it to
find foul smells like animal BM and dead bodies of animals then fetch and collect
those foul smells to assist the surroundings clean, facilitate the farmers to provide their
chemical, and conjointly facilitate individuals avoid health issues that may get from

the animal BM and dead bodies of it.
1.2 Project Context

According to Mary T. Bassett, M.D., M.P.H, 2019, prolonged exposure to the
animal feces and animal dead body could have a variety of health repercussions, from
nothing to little discomfort to more severe symptoms. Animal feces have chemicals
with a strong odor that could irritate the eyes, nose, throat, and lungs, coughing,
wheezing, or other breathing problems. If a smell if it persists for a long time or keeps
happening, it may also have an impact on stress level, anxiety, and mood. According to
Cecile Arnould et al., 2018, dog feces found an active chemical and has the highest
repellent effect. According to the ""Center for Environmental Health "", 2019, exposure
depends on the body weight intake/inhaled. Child exposure to the same level as adult

€xposure can result in more sensitive than the grownup. The more significant quantity
of'a material to which a person is exposed, the more likely Effects on health will happen.
A comparatively safe material can become toxic in large quantities. There are also three
important Toutes of exposure, inhalation, direct contact, and ingestion. The most

common method of exposure that might irritate the nose, airways, and lungs is through

"Thesis Archiving
","ABSTRACT

Every graduating student is required to do a thesis project or a research paper,
most of the students spend Sleepless nights just to make their thesis project and to be
able to pass and graduate. The thesis' physical copy is being thrown away or left to
collect dust, which is the sole issue. In order to preserve undergraduate and graduate
thesis, a LAN-based system is used for the thesis archiving system. The admin must
carefully handle and archive the thesis because it is crucial. For individuals who
conducted their study through their school libraries, the system is accessible. The
advantage of this strategy is that students can download whatever thesis they choose
and utilize the system's search feature to get what they're searching for. This method is
being used to save the thesis in order to make it possible for students to look for a

research paper for academic purposes. Finally, thesis archiving is used to save the
thesis output and contains a collection of full-text and bibliographic material on a
variety of business, scientific, and technology-related issues.

Introductions

1.1 Rationale of the Study

Technology is commonly used tools for today’s world as a time goes
by all transactions and things will be dependent on this. Thesis archiving
system stores and manages documents for students’ thesis projects in one
system. One of the human activity systems made for a particular purpose is
manual-based. However, as technology advances, how data and information
are managed will change in the future. In this manner, human thought will
generate fresh concepts for organizing data properly. Next, devise a plan to
organize data in a centralized database system using a computerized
management system.

The ACLC College of Butuan City research project is stored in the
library using the manual process which makes researcher’s waste their time
in finding the book they want. As days go by one of the disadvantages of

increasing numbers of researcher’s today is having a manual process of
compiling research books inside the library and the misplacement of it gives
a hard time to a researcher to find the academic research they want. Human

error also causes the mismanagement of the projects in the wrong place.
The proponent decided to develop thesis archiving locally at ACLC
College of Butuan City which provides storage for thesis output. It contains a

collection of full-text and bibliographic information on science, technology

and business-related topics.

1.2 Project Context

Thesis Archiving System will provide easy viewing, access, and storing for
the graduating and undergraduate students. Due to the fact that in the long run the
thesis paper they pass may get damaged or get thrown away. So, the archiving system
was created to help with record management. The plan promises to assist in the
maintenance, preservation, and retrieval of undergraduate and graduate thesis for as
long as needed.

Also, the archiving system aids students, particularly those who are graduating
students to research, view and download thesis in the school library using LAN
suitable for their studies.

1.3 Purpose and Description

The purpose of the archiving system was to facilitate record management.
Undergraduate and graduate thesis can reportedly be preserved and retrieved with
the use of technology. They will be needed for however long they are needed.

This system is mostly concerned with electronic data. Concepts related to
record-keeping must be understood in the context of information technology,

recordkeeping procedures to generate accurate and efficient reports and correct
automated file management. It transforms information into a usable format that will
enable the process to go smoothly. The system provides reassurance that the file will be
safe and secure since access to the system requires authorization. This server serves as
the barangay's record-keeping system for files. Additionally, this will guarantee that the
file is safely saved in the system and create a backup of the contents in the event of a
technical malfunction. Additionally, this would make their lives easier, especially when
it comes to creating reports for the municipality regarding the state of the barangay. The
system will have a big impact on the barangay's citizens, the barangay workers who run
the system, and the barangay itself. The way the barangay now maintains its files will
change with the adoption of the new system. Asa result, we can conclude that the system
would definitely help them in the long run to secure all of the records that would give
accurate data and expedite, simplify the task.

follows the waterfall model methodology. This system's interface is written and
designed using python, client-side scripting using JavaScript, and server-side scripting
using python. The system has three users: administrator, owner, and tenant. The
proponents carefully analyzed all the necessary data gathered from the internet and
conducted a survey to assess the quality of the system — to thirty (30) respondents
composed of ten (10) house rental owner, and twenty (20) house renter. The assessment
accumulated 4.47 total mean, equivalent to highly acceptable. The device is indeed an
ideal solution to help landlords efficiently manage their information digitally and, in

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study
In this day, age of Information and Communication Technology (ICT),
computerized booking is expected to provide more convenience to consumers because
they will be able to book at any time, and people may work from any location as long

as they have access to the internet (Mazlan, 2018).

Rental housing is a growing and profitable investment sector that has attracted
many investors from developed and developing nations worldwide. Housing is one of
life's most fundamental needs. It is imperative for economic, social, cultural, and
personal well-being. International human rights legislation recognizes the right to

decent housing. (Nations, 2014).

According to the National Urban Rental Housing Policy (Draft) 2015, issued by
the housing ministry and urban poverty alleviation, rental housing refers to the owner's
property. The tenant pays periodic mutually agreed rent to the owner. As the number of
tenants tends to increase, the management of the rental houses tends to be complicated.
Most of them are paper-based. Some tenants can use this weakness to evade paying the

rent, losing the landlords.

To break out the problem, researchers developed an Android-based named
House Rental System, which aims to solve the common problem of all tenants,
landlords, owners and make the easiest way of locating rent houses. In the past few

years, some researchers were proposed a ‘""HAYBOL: An Android-Based Apartment
Locator Application (2017)” to provide the needs of the tenants. Unfortunately, specific
solution scenarios were insufficient to meet the needs of all consumers. It is because
not all renters can afford personal computers. Some renters in remote locations were
unable to quickly rent a Personal Computer (PC) or locate a computer store to browse
online to access the site of the aforementioned web-based system. To assist in resolving
the issue, proponents offer a mobile app called ""House Rental Management System.”
It is a mobile-based program that will make it more comfortable for renters, particularly
those who do not have personal computers and rely solely on smartphones and Android
phones. Using the internet, users may quickly download and install the program from

the Google Play store.

As a result, the goal of our initiative is to assist owners/landlords manage their
rental housing firm digitally and without hassle and give access to low-income families,
employees, students, and others. To conveniently locate houses-to-let using technology
rather than physically searching for available rental houses or contacting brokers to
assist them with the process of locating rental residences, which may entail additional
costs. This system will assist landlords in advertising and promoting their house rental
business online in order to obtain as many tenants as possible, which will serve as a

source of income

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

Monitoring is usual storage that detects something people use to record their
daily activities. It will help the parents monitor and be with their baby every minute
of every day. Parenting is not an easy task, and responsibilities seem to change from
day to day. However, one task is always important, monitoring your baby by
notifying you. Research says that monitoring your baby's behavior is a crucial way to
lower its chances to prevent incidents, especially those that can be harmful, like the
environmental temperature SCANVA, 2021. Parents still have to don their household
chores, etc., but either finish a task or comfort the baby. Other times may be that the
parents are outside gardening or showering. However, how parents look after their
children has changed with technological breakthroughs. They are now thinking about
adopting technological and engineering inventions for advantages and benefits in

terms of the safety issues of their babies IRJET, 2019. According to SCANVA, 2021
that monitoring means establishing firm guidelines and limits for your baby to keep
notified of what is going on with its behavior.

According to the study of Broken Homes and Battered Children, 1993,
conducted by Robert Whelan, the mother's boyfriend appears to be a particularly
potent source of danger to the child. When a young child is alone with his mother’s
friend, he is at increased risk of being left behind. According to SSA, 2021, the
temperature can make your baby cry. They may call because they are too hot or too

cold.
According to STANFORD CHILDREN'S HEALTH, 2021, Babies cannot
regulate their body temperature, and toddlers are also more sensitive to temperature.
One of the most common dilemmas facing parents these days is how to monitor their
baby while taking care of other things.

Maybe it's to do chores, work, go on a bathroom break, or get a quick
breather while the baby sleeps. But as many new mommies and daddies find out, this
is next to impossible. You can't keep an eye on your precious little one 24/7.

Since these accidents can be preventable that we are already in an innovative
generation, the proponents decided to propose a study that the baby can be monitored
by high-end innovative technology entitled, Monitoring Baby's Behavior and
Environment Temperature with SMS Notification Alarm Features using Raspberry Pi

to provide a solution to the problem that leads to frequent crib cause of incidents to
infant babies. A prototype will monitor and detect the baby's motion and check the
environment's temperature. Once the action is already met, the active motion and the
temperature of the room is already high, and it will turn on the Buzzer and send an
SMS Notification to the parent to notify them that the baby is already awake standing

or holding on the crib from sleep and the temperature of the room is already high or

hot.

"SMART BLIND STICK
","ABSTRACT

The Smart Blind Stick is based on ultrasonic sensors and Arduino for visually
impaired individuals. People with visual impairments frequently rely on outside
assistance, which can come from humans, trained dogs, or unique electronic devices
that act as decision-making aids. As a result, we were inspired to create a smart blind
stick to help people overcome their constraints. We achieved this goal by placing
ultrasonic sensors and water sensors in strategic locations on the stick, which
activated the sound and conveyed information about the environment to the user. We
presented a low-cost, lightweight device with a microprocessor that analyses signals
and notifies visually impaired people to any obstacles, water, or dark places by using
the LED lights to enable them to be recognized by others. The system comprises
obstacle and moisture detection sensors that receive, process, and send signals to an
alarm system, which then notifies the user.

","Chapter I
INTRODUCTION

Found in this chapter are the study's rationale, project context, the objectives of

the study, and the scopes and limitations.

1.1 Rationale of the Study

Visually impaired people are perplexed by society and fearful of their
surroundings. They wanted to stay at home rather than go out most of the time. They
may cause problems for others as a result of this.

James Biggs, a photographer from Bristol who went blind following an accident
and was concerned about the quantity of traffic near his home, decided to paint his
walking stick white to make it more noticeable. Guilly d'Herbemont founded a
national white stick movement for blind persons in France. In the presence of
numerous French ministers, he symbolically presented the first two white canes to
blind individuals; 5,000 more white canes were eventually sent to blind French
veterans of World War | and blind citizens (WCBlind Org., 2019). The white blind
stick has been around for generations, allowing blind or visually impaired to walk

around securely and freely wherever they want to go. This item also serves as a

visible cue to others that the user is blind or visually impaired.

Dealing with vision loss or low vision is just one of the hurdles or issues that

the visually impaired face in everyday life. Blind people are basically like everyone
2
else, except they can't see. The most challenging thing for them is to navigate
locations, especially if they have completely lost their vision (WeCapable, 2021),

Their main issue is that they are concerned about their safety while moving
around or traveling alone (R. Abbas, et al., 2016). They have minimal interaction with
the world around them. Physical movement is difficult for visually impaired people
since it is difficult for them to discern barriers in front of them, and they are unable to
go from one location to another. For movement and financial assistance, they rely on
their family. Their impairment prevents them from engaging with others and

participating in social activities (D.Sathya, et al., 201 8).

In the Philippines, an estimated 332,150 people are bilaterally blind, with
cataracts accounting for 33% (109,619), errors of refraction (EOR) accounting for
25% (83,037), and glaucoma accounting for 14% (46,501). Glaucoma, retinopathy,
and maculopathy are among the remaining eye diseases. In addition to these numbers,
the Department of Health reports that there are presently 2,179,733 people with low
bilateral vision, with EOR accounting for 43% (937,285), cataracts for 34%

(741,109), and glaucoma and other eye disorders accounting for the rest (2017).

The blind stick serves as much more than a guide or a warning device. It gives
blind individuals access to four important developmental areas that are the most
impacted by the handicap, It's a critical developmental tool for a person's
neurodevelopment, which includes sensory, physical, social, and emotional

development (Braille Works, 2021). Therefore, the proponent decided to use Arduino
3

to create a Smart Blind Stick that can detect impediments and assist blind people i
ple in

navigating without assistance.

A water sensor uses to detect potholes and flooded regions, GPS for their
location. The location message tracker sends a message to the user's guardian,
informing them of their present location. In addition, the guardian will be confident in
their situation and will be able to follow their location, if necessary. A camera was
also included to capture their current state, a headphone for voice communications to
keep the user awake in the assured clear distance ahead to avert any potential
accidents en route. In addition, there is a LED light used at night and in emergencies.
All of this allows them to move independently and safely while avoiding tripping

dangers such as cracks, poles, and other obstacles.

1.2 Project Context

One of the most common mobility aids for the visually impaired is the blind
stick. However, it does not assist visually impaired users in locating impediments at
the level of the head or knee or distances greater than one meter, Kim, S. Y., & Cho,
K. (2016). Smart sticks with ultrasonic sensors, water sensors, headphones, and a
more extended range for obstacle detection have been introduced to overcome these
challenges. However, individuals with visual impairments are unlikely to use the
smart stick due to some usability concerns.

The goal of this study was to determine the smart blind stick's usability. It
automatically detects the obstacles in front of the person at a distance of 2 meters with

the help of the sensors and gives them the response that converts into sound and gives

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

The City of Butuan is one of the arcas in the Philippines that always and
frequently experience flooding when heavy and extreme rainfall scenarios occur in
the area. It is located at the Agusan Valley, Mindanao, sprawling across. It is bounded
to the north, west, and south by Agusan del Norte, the east by Agusan del Sur, and the
northwest by Butuan Bay. (Joy C. Casinginan, 2017) . The city's geographic location
suggests rigorous preparation for the unexpected hazards that will probably strike.
Records of typhoons that have struck Butuan City are noted, especially Tropical
Depression Agaton and Seniang. Accessibility to transportation during the flood event
is difficult. Because this natural phenomenon can result in significant loss of lives and
properties, preparation is best applied before this Calamity occurs. Most government
agencies, especially the Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DRRM) Offices,
initiate various programs to improve their services to their respective locale. Since
technology is now on the verge of making human life more manageable and
performing digital processes and automation, the use of technologies to change and

enhance the systems and protocols of the CGB is deemed necessary. (Alexander T.

Demetillo, 2016)

According to Queenie Lozada and Gino Abatayo, residents of Baan River
Side, most of them are unaware of the location and availability of Evacuation
Facilities suitable for the evacuces' families' health situation. According to their
experience, being an evacuee is difficult, especially when the evacuation center is
overcrowded, Crystal Palado, one of the residents of Barangay Mahogany, also stated
that most of them are aware of the common evacuation center on their barangay.
However, they are unsure if that particular evacuation is safe, still available, and
appropriate for their family's health situation. Based on their experience during
Calamity, the evacuees fully occupied the evacuation center. The elderly and sick
individuals share the same room. Individuals are just putting up tents in the corners to

provide shelter during others.

The proponents decided to develop a Web-Based Calamity Assistance Locator
system that uses GPS to help the residents and provide them the nearest Evacuation
Center in terms of Calamity. By providing them a suitable evacuation facility based
on the health status of their family. Our system will automatically give a location
closer to the user's present location by filling in all of the essential information from

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

In most hospital facilities, manual monitoring has been their preference and
practice. The doctors or nurses, hour by hour, or even minute by minute, check
on their individual patients' condition directly. Today, direct contact with
individuals is not safe because of the pandemic brought about by a dangerous
virus called Corona Virus Disease 19 (COVID-19). This pandemic is happening

in almost all of the countries in the world, including ours.

The Internet of Things (loT) has been in the spotlight for the past decade. It
is regarded as one of the disruptive technologies of this century and so far, has
caught the attention of society, industry, and academy as a way of
technologically enhancing day to day activities, the creation of new business
models, products, and services, and as a comprehensive source of research
topics and ideas. Several alliances, institutions, enterprises, and even
governments have understood its importance and identified the potential
benefits obtained from the loT, leading them to undertake strategic projects and

initiatives to develop this field and profit from it (Alkhatib, 2017).

In hospital facility matters, having a high number of patients increases the
number of difficulties in checking the patient, heartbeat, temperature, etc. To
make it easier for the Doctor or Nurses, real-time patient heartbeat and

temperature monitoring must be utilized. A patients' real-time heartbeat and
temperature monitoring consist of hardware that monitors the patient. It also

has a web page to notify the user.

Therefore, the researcher decided to develop the Doctor Assistant: loT in
the Health Sector using a Heartbeat sensor, Blood pressure monitor,
Glucometer, and Temperature sensor with notification to solve the problem. It
has a prototype that monitors the patient's heartbeat, blood sugar, blood
pressure, and temperature and notifies the user. It has a module that provides

the parameter of the study.
1.2 Project Context

Hospital is an institution providing medical and surgical treatment and
nursing care for sick or injured people. Most hospitals performed direct contact
with the patients by continuously measuring specific parameters using a
medical monitor device. Due to a high number of patients, monitoring has
become more complicated for Doctors or Nurses. As hospitals are essential,
particularly in high-poverty areas, and as a source of providing medical care to

patients in need.

A Doctor Assistant: loT in the Health Sector using Heartbeat sensor and
Temperature sensor with the notification is developed to minimize the workload
and avoid direct contact with the Doctors and Nurses' patients. Using a
heartbeat sensor, it can detect the heartbeat, and with a temperature sensor to

detect the patients' temperature.

INTRODUCTION
1.1 Rationale of the Study

In the last decade, independent or “indie” games have emerged

as a potent force for creativity and a counterbalance to conventional
Triple-A video games with big budgets. The indie industry is generally
described as fortunate, as Dale North at VentureBeat (2015) suggests:
“Indie outfits can afford to try new, untested game-making approaches
as they probably have no one to answer to but themselves.” The
emergence and popularity of high-profile titles, especially Minecraft
(2011), as well as the acclaimed documentary exploring a few
developers’ lives—Indie Game: “The Movie (2012)”. All of these signal a
trend towards an explosion of independent titles from all over the world.
All of this coincides with the rapid democratization of game production
tools and knowledge, with major multi-platform professional engines like
Unreal and Unity becoming free for many new developers. However, as
the independent sector has significantly expanded, independent game
development’s economics and labor conditions have often been ignored
or inaccurately conflated with legal development needs. Nadav D. Lipkin

(2019).

Mobile learning and educational gaming are two trends that are
rapidly having an increasing impact on Technology-Enhanced Learning.

However, both approaches present significant technological challenges.
Mobile technologies are very diverse, and the market pressure
pushes the continuous development of new technologies and features.

Pablo Lavin-Mera, et al. (2017).

Butuan Throughout the years: A mobile time travel game to
Butuan’s rich history. It is an android-based mobile game, developed not
only as a game entertainment but also to introduce the meaningful
history of Butuan. The proponents are to learn the history of Butuan in a
fun and interactive way, and this will be a way for people to know the
importance of Butuan history. Most of us forget the history of our golden
town of Butuan city. This game develops to educate young people; about
Butuan history through an engaging, fun mobile game. But also, it helps

the users to gain knowledge about the History of Butuan.

","ABSTRACT

A Learning Management System is timely and relevant to Alternative
Leaming System Schools or ALS. It provides students and teachers a virtual
access to their classes. The students can view lessons, take quizzes and
exams and submit their work online, while the teachers can upload files for
lessons, organized the content of a certain course like quizzes or exams and
evaluation of students. Also teachers and students can communicate with each
other for some clarifications. In this study, the proponents introduced the
ALStudy: A Learning Management System for Alternative Learning System
Schools intended only for the ALS community. It gives the students and
teachers a modern learning tool through virtual classes that is convenient to
their time. The most used LMS nowadays are Moodle and Google Classroom
but most of the LMS was developed for formal basic education. Since there are
lots of LMS as of now the proponents decided to developed a project that is
different from others, the ALStudy takes advantage of existing LMS features
but focusing only for ALS, following their class structures and curriculum.

Keywords:
Learning Management System (LMS), ALStudy
","Chapter |
INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

Alternative Leaming System is a substitute for a formal primary
education, which the govemment established to support less privileged
Students who want to finish formal education. Republic Act 9155 of the
Philippines stipulates that the Altemative Leaming System (ALS) provides out-
of-school children, youth, and adults with primary schooling. With Alternative
Leaming System (ALS), it gives a chance to students to continue to access and
to complete primary education. A PSA Annual Poverty Indicator Survey-2017
shows that many Filipinos do not have an opportunity to attend and finish formal
primary education (Grades 1-6, Junior High School and Senior High School).
Some of the students drop out of schools, while some do not have schools in
their communities. Besides having no school in an isolated area, the Alternative

Learning System (ALS) medium is limited with face-to-face.

The advancement of technology and the Internet brought an increasing
avenue for managing and accessing learning. A learning management system
(LMS) allows the students to study through dynamic mediums, such as face-to-
face, blended and online. There are many existing Learning Management

systems, and most of them used in a fully online manner.

Integrating an Online Learning Management System (LMS) in an
Alternative Learning System (ALS) will bridge the gap for students who will not
attend a class in a face-to-face manner. It will also address the problem in

dealing with those isolated areas that do not have a physical Learning center.
Based on this matter, the proponents proposed an ALStudy: A Learning
Management System for Alternative Learning System School that allows the
teachers to manage learning materials and activities. Also, it will enable the
teacher or trainer to monitor the progress of students. Similarly, the students
will benefit from accessing the portal to do the task and activities online. It will
bridge the gap between having no physical classroom in isolated areas and

allowing them to continue their primary education through the portal provided.

1.2 Purpose and Description
This study aims to develop a project that will help both ALS teachers and

students manage their time and make things more convenient on both sides.

Also to promote Virtual Learning to the teachers and students to prepare them

for the increasingly global and knowledge-based economy ALStudy: A Leaming

Management System has a class structure that can upload and download file

help the trainer to monitor the record of the students. The propose

communication (chatbox) features that will allow the teachers an stud

1.1. Introduction

This year 2020, the world experiences what could be the most
devastating pandemic in human history bought by COVID-19. Currently,
the situation remains fluid, and countries and nations still struggle to
contain the problem. According to the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, the Philippines is one of the worst-hit countries in
Southeast Asia. It ranks number 1 in the most number of infected cases.
Corona-virus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a
newly discovered coronavirus. This virus's infection rate is incredibly high
and is an airborne disease as of recent studies. The people who are
heavily affected by this virus are mainly the elderly and teenagers, albeit

to a lesser degree, affected by this. It has even come to the point that
citizens are always forced to carry hand sanitizer and wear surgical masks
whenever they go outside. With the increasing demand for alcohols and
sanitizers creating a scarcity, most people cannot bring them everywhere.
According to a recent study by G. Kampf (2020), The corona-virus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a massive demand for
alcohol-based hand rubs, medical gloves, face masks, and gowns in

healthcare and from the public. The current shortage of some articles is

Introduction

1.1 Rationale of the Study

According to Jurik (2016), logistics has improved and became a
well-developed division that offers continuous process improvement for
companies, communities and supply chain management, and innovation. That
logistics service handles the processes of packaging, shipping, inventory. A
high satisfaction rating is essential to get the loyalty of the customers. At
present, competition against other competitors in e-commerce is very
aggressive. It will do whatever it takes to win and be successful. The companies
will be committed to providing better facilities to cater the customer's demands
and needs and better service than the rest of the competitors. Providing
Superior service is an essential and differentiating element, and within the
scope of the business, the delivery of the delivery business is the most
important. (Fereshteh Alizadeh, Minah Lahiji, October 2018). Through the
development of the internet, e-commerce has boosted significantly and one of
the most prominent service offered in the country is food delivery. Food delivery
applications provide the idea of ease and pleasure to young people. Because
of the development of e-commerce, particularly in the food delivery segment, it
is Convenient for those who want Food to get delivered at their doorstep and it
has checked that the younger generation brings enjoyment towards ready to

eat Food. (Ms. Ardhana M. Prabhash, February 2020).
With the development of technology and society and the
widespread use and development level of smartphones and the internet, the
purchase approach of a product is no longer restricted to physical stores but of
increasing diversification instead of the specific demands from consumers.
Also, there is a growing trend towards online and sales among many fields not

just in the food industry but also in other business means.

The rapid growth of e-commerce has created new forms of
businesses, such as online to offline (O20), and has alternated the traditional
tasks and jobs. O20 is a marketing method based on information and
communications technology (ICT) in which customers are captivated online and
actuated to complete a transaction in an offline setting. To put it differently, the
customer can place orders of products online, and after the transaction, the
customer will receive the package i an “?f ine manner, such as on time
doorstep of your house, or it could be delivered in your office depending of on
the delivery date and time. Accessibility and the ability to share information
quickly have led to mobile commerce’s speedy growth connecting suppliers and
customers via smartphone applications. O20 service have appeared in
different fields, including food delivery services, hotels, real estates, and more.
Real-time connectivity of delivery apps on mobile devices provides
conveniences such as simplicity, saves time, and offers a wide range of
products and services that sometimes cannot found in a physical store. The
change in how consumers order their products and services daily. One example

of 020 services is Online Ordering System. Online Ordering Systems has

become an instrument for people with needs that can be found online and don’t
need to go to an actual store. Going to a store can be tiring to some. With the
technology in our control, such as computers and smartphones, and with the
use of reliable internet connection, finding the products and services we are

looking for online is only a few swipes and taps away before getting it on hand.

One issue relevant in e-commerce today, particularly in the
Philippines, is the cancellation of food orders after the customers is making the
order. As stated by Jeline Malasig, 2019, GrabFood announced on their
Facebook page that there are too many “Excessive no-show’ incidents upon
using the application, and they will soon penalize those customers that cancel
the orders after it is processed. The company said that users could not withdraw
their charges once they have placed them. In cases of “no-show” or when a
customer cancels his/her order, the food courier will take responsibility for
purchasing the canceled order without getting any payment from the customer.
The management reminds the app users to be responsible by making sure that
hey input the right address and items that they will order. A few days later, an
online petition has to send to Grab Philippines President Brian Cu to address
“no-show” events. The people on social media plead to the company to
permanently remove the “Cancel” option in the application. The delivery rider

may no longer undergo the consequences of having orders that are unclaimed

by the customers.

The issue mentioned above encouraged the proponents to come
up with a proposed design of developing an Online Ordering System with a

Global Positioning System (GPS) for tracking of the device used by the
customer after taking the order. With the help of a mobile device, an internet

connection, and GPS, the merchant will track the location of the customer's
device. After the order is processed, the merchant will assign an authorized
courier that will be the one who will deliver the package to the customer with

the use of GPS tracking.

For “e-Hatud: Web Online Ordering and Delivering System with
GPS tracking for independent Merchant in Butuan City” to be developed, the
proponents must know about Online Delivering Systems. The proponents also
must have enough knowledge to understand how the GPS works, and how to
tie in with the system they are trying to make. They must also have enough
experience in developing the project using a programming language of their

choice.

1.2 Purpose and Description

The researchers’ study intends to help merchants that are selling

goods and can locate the device that the customer uses through GPS tracking.
Aweb application that can help merchants to sell their products, mainly grocery
items. After a customer processes an order, the merchant can prepare the
package and let the authorized courier deliver the package upon gaining access

to the customer’s device’s location from the merchant.

1.1 Project context

One of the most country with motorbike users in Southeast Asia is
probably the Philippines because of its abundance and sudden rise in number.
The motorbike is probably the most popular and easiest way of transportation
for every Filipinos; most in every place in the country, you can see a motorcycle
in every corner, but it has also been the common target of thieves. According
to the National Capital Region Police Office's (NCRPO) Regional Investigation
and Detection Management Division ( RIDMD), it has been reported that in
2015, over 3000 motorcycles has been stolen from January to March alone,
and has shown a massive jump of 11.89% from statistic during the same period
from the previous year with only a little 2500 units were taken. According to the
Highway Patrol Group (HPG), about 150 motorcycles are stolen every week in
Metro Manila alone, or an estimated average of 21 per day. The spokesman
superintendent Elizabeth Velazquez of HPG also stated that in 2014, 11, 870
motorcycles were stolen, while 10, 771 were taken in 2013. In Caraga Butuan
City, based on the record of the Traffic Section of Butuan City Police, 74
accidents are recorded in 2017 due to drunk driving. According to the recent
study, Motorcycle Theft Prevention and Recovery Security System (Publish in
2017) by Archie O. Pachica, Dhave S. Barsalote, Jessy Mae P. Geraga,
Jhestine M. Ong, and Michael D. Sajulan. Transportation plays a big part in our

daily lives. Every year, people in the Philippines are increasingly using vehicles,
especially motorcycles, as their common means of transportation. Together
with the increase of motorcycle users, motorcycle theft is also rampant over the
years. Their study developed a system for the theft prevention and recovery of
the motorcycle more comfortably and faster. The user will be noticed through
an alert once the motorcycle has been moved in a long-distance or stolen. The
user could also view the current location, shut down the engine, and capture
the thief's image. The hardware component includes a micro-controller, GSM,
GPS, and a camera. The software component is the mobile application, which
is the medium of communication of the user to the motorcycle and serves as
the main controller of their entire system. To differentiate from the previous
research, we use the GPS, GSM, and Microcontroller to prevent motorcycle
theft. The proposed of the MATH GT is to notify the owner when the motorcycle

has been stolen. And reduce road accidents due to alcohol intake.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study
Rice production in the Philippines is an essential aspect of the

country's food supply and economy. The Philippines are one of the countries

still using the traditional way of farming. In most of the rice-farming industries,
manual monitoring and watering have been employed. The farmer needs to
monitor the soil's moisture manually, but it's hard for them to monitor the
water's saline level. According to Dr. M.B Sturgis, head, LSU Department of
Agronomy, saltwater can become a problem in rice production, especially in
some areas in dry years. A small amount of saltwater is not dangerous to rice
at any stage of growth. Higher concentrations affect the existing crop and can
cause a build-up of salt in the soil. Rice grown on soils relatively free of salt is
tolerant to salt water with 35 grains (600 parts per million) per gallon of
sodium chloride. This problem encountered the Philippines’ farmers due to
lack of equipment and knowledge about technology, especially those in a

small industry. Water is an essential part of plant growth for about 60%.

Therefore, the soil moisture content (soil moisture) as a medium for
growing plants is essential in agricultural cultivation. The availability of water
becomes the primary determinant in the production of agricultural
commodities. According to Dobermann A, Fairhurst T. 2000 salinity affects the
respiration and photosynthesis of plants. It decreases biological N2 fixation
and soil nitrogen mineralization. Its other effects on rice growth include
reduced germination rate, reduced plant height and tillering low root growth,

and increased spikelet sterility. The problem also related to the requirement of
human resources to perform manual activities, and during the watering
season, rice fields were manually watered. Again, not all owners can monitor
their crops from time to time. Based on this matter, the proponents decided to
conduct research and studies, which leads them to create a rice field

automation system embedding moisture and salinity detection with notification

and irrigation control facility.

By and large, automating and monitoring rice fields and their status on
their specific identifying elements becomes a necessity. This then leads the
proponents to propose a system that will automate a rice field that embeds its
soil moisture and salinity detection features with notification and irrigation

control mechanism.

1.2 Project Context

Butuan Bay is a bay and extension of the Bohol Sea, a.k.a the
Mindanao Sea, in the northeast section of Mindanao in the Philippines. Its
primary river source is the Agusan River, which empties into the bay at the
coastal city of Butuan. Some of the rivers of Butuan City are connected to the
sea, and it contains saltwater. Farmers get some water into the river and in
NAIA irrigation, but this water source has no control over which this water
came from. Butuan City also has a dry season. When this season comes,
some of the owners can't monitor their crops daily due to lack of time, and
they have other responsibilities and duties, and it can cause damage the
crops and affect the growth. The proponents concluded that the common
problem of monitoring rice fields and water status is that the water saline
engages the crops without a frequent update of the water status and soil

moisture. The labor, landowner, and financier are the primary beneficiaries of

1.1 Background of the Study
In the wake of COVID-19, the Commission on Higher Education

(CHED) and the Department of Education (DepEd) deliberately help how
classes from all levels will be directed by our new normal. Classes with
physical contact are suspended, and private online classes are currently the
methods for educating. Making and observing all the understudies' tests in a
Class is now tiring and tedious for instructors, and still, they need to make their
essential arrangements for educating the students. The advocates inferred
that the basic issue in online classes besides the web, accessibility of
contraptions and the information on utilizing on the web stages is that
instructors make tests and then upload it to the web and monitors all the
Students' exams through manual checking in a class and send feedbacks to
the understudies individually.

[tem analysis is a process that looks at student reactions to individual
test items (questions) to survey the nature of those things and the test in
general. It is an important, great strategy accessible to showing experts and
teachers the direction and improvement of guidelines. This strategy

accomplished for acquiring DV (Difficulty Value) and D.P. (Discriminative
Power). The difficulty value or D.V. of an item is defined as the proportion or
percentage of the examinees who have answered the item correctly.

According to the revelations of the investigation of Sirri and Freddano

(2011), in the standardized and target appraisal of understudy shows, the
thing assessment is a cycle wherein the two understudies’ answers and test
questions are investigated to review the quality and measure of the things and
the test generally. Khan, Ishrat, and Khan (2015) communicated that item
examination is proposed for students' arrangement level by surveying the
requests given in evaluation.

According to Asst. Prof. Anabella C. Doctor, Information Technology
and Information System Department, Adamson University, Philippines and Dr.
Carmelita H. Benito Information Technology and Information System
Department, Adamson University, Philippines Item Analysis is a factual
method that causes personnel and foundations to assess the quality and wipe
out deceiving test things remembered for a test given and taken by the

understudies.

According to Kennedy Quaigrain and Ato Kwamina Ahren, Item
analysis is fundamental in improving things, which will utilize it again in later
tests; it can likewise use it to dispose of deluding item in a test The
examination zeroed in on thing and test quality and investigated the
connection between trouble record (p-worth) and segregation list (DI) with
distractor effectiveness (D.E.).

Accordingly, item banking is a very convenient tool for the educational
System to monitor academic achievement. Advanced and sophisticated

Computer software further enhances the possibilities towards high calibrated
item banks. In light of the discoveries of the investigation of Razak et al.

(2011), and all-around created computerized item bank empowers the
educators to plan the ideal test, and the instructors can tailor each test to their
nearby instructive targets and consider who is to be estimated without losing
contact with the regular center of bank things.

According to Quaigrain and Arhin (2017), item analysis is the exhibition

of items thought about exclusively, either corresponding to some outer model
or comparable to the test's excess items.

According to Sir Pits Onez(2020), Dean of the General Education
department at ACLC College of Butuan. To achieve item analysis, you must
follow the standard equation to evaluate the question correctly and have a fair
judgment. He added in item analysis; it covers all test types. From our brief
interview with Sir Ofiez, we have determined that the most critical component
in an Item Analysis is DV (Difficulty Value) and DI (Discrimination Index).
Utilizing the two standards together, we can assess whether the test question
is simple, hard, or troublesome and if it needs further improvement.

To differentiate our proposed system for previous software such as
quiz generator, question banking, our system can create tests, automate
Student test checking, and incorporate item analysis and test banks for the
reliability and validity of the test. Creating and uploading the students’ tests is
very tiring and tedious for the educators, for they will even now make the PDF
format then upload it to the site, which is excessive for internet data.
Therefore, the proponents agreed to develop a system where teachers can
create test questionnaires or quizzes on the web and the answer key and

automatically check the student's answered test. The questions per test item
will be categorized and evaluated according to their difficulty level through
item analysis. Before the test questionnaire moves to the test bank, the
instructors test will be submitted and assessed by the administrator.

The proponents develop a project entitled ""Q-Gen: A Web-Based
Comprehensive Test Creator For All Field Of Study With Item Analysis
Feature"" that instructors can make their questionnaires along with the
appropriate response key, consequently checks the student test/tests with a
tally of every test item in all test types and incorporates test banking.

The system is intended to solve the gap of the existing systems
mentioned above and improve the quality of the items on a test, so educators
can improve the test's general nature, henceforth improving both the

unwavering quality and legitimacy of making such a test. The system to be
created by the defenders needs to utilize PHP as Web interface back-end and
bootstrap, HTML, CSS, java content for the front-end plan, and MYSQL for
the database. Through this, we can diminish the outstanding burden of our
dear instructors in making, checking, and monitoring the tests/quizzes of
students’ inside the class and causes them to embrace and focus on their
teaching and give relevant ideas to the students to improve their studies in
this new sort of learning. To encourage information dividing between the
understudies and improve the educators’ capacities to comprehend the

Students’ concem in their assessments and give successful and solid tests for

students.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

A critical aspect of our culture is healthcare. In other words, one of the
most critical issues is health services. In recent times, the people's health care
concept has undergone a tremendous change, which has led to higher
expectations and increased demand for high-quality medical care and facilities.
The clinic is responsible for providing health medication and treatment for all
types of people. Healthcare organizations of all sizes face a critical need to
manage and integrate clinical and operational information.

Many clinics in our country are currently storing patients’ records by
using paper or card manual systems. Nurses Need to write down the patient
information for registration and index the patients' medical. After the
registration, the patient's files will be kept in the rack, which will cause problems.
Moreover, patients’ information is not secure and will cause issues like taking a
long time to retrieve the data.

Clinics need to take security seriously, considering the sensitive
information and large volume of traffic they handle. The institutions must also
comply with strict privacy standards such as the Health Information Technology
for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act that came into effect in
February 2009. The act provides more muscle to the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). HITECH implements new standards
for electronic health records security and includes notification requirements for

healthcare data breaches.
In this study, the proponents’ objective is to develop a web-based
application that allows the clinic to monitor its patient's information. The
proponents’ came up with this idea to enable the clinic to manage and monitor
its transactions quickly. In this way, the clinic's business becomes efficient and

reliable in giving services and processing documents to the patient.

1.2 Project Context

According to Melvin G. Makinano, many clinics in our country are still
storing patients' records using paper or card manual systems. Nurses always
need to write down the patient information and index the patients’ medical.
Then, this medical card will keep on the organized racks or in the cabinets.
These works are so troublesome and plaguing. Moreover, patients’ information
is not secure.

A clinic is an organization responsible for providing health medication
and treatment for all types of people. Indeed, some people need to use the
clinic services—but still using the traditional method. The conventional way
means the customer needs to fill in their details in the registration form
manually, and the information will be kept in files. After the registration, the files
will save files in the rack, and this will cause problems like taking a long time to
retrieve the information, make mistakes during writing or misplace the files

Automated Aqua Scape Tank (IOT) using Raspberry Pi has been

developed to give an aid specifically for the people who have pet shops and
handle large amounts of different animals to minimize their tasks and to
individuals who love to keep a fish but do not have enough time. This study
focuses only on the water level detection, water toxicity detection, and
automatic feeding of fishes. Furthermore, notification systems (via SMS) were
also included in the study to be more interactive wherein the pet owner will
receive a message whenever the water level in the fish tank decreases and
also will receive a message whenever the fish food container is empty. It is for
the owner to be notified. The Raspberry Pi has been chosen to be used as a
microcontroller in gathering information from the water level sensor and pH
sensor and mechanically control the aqua scape tank. The proponent
conducted a survey for the software quality of the system to the pet shop
Owners and other individuals who are petting a fish in a tank. The software was
indeed functional because it helps them to feed and care for the fishes inside
the tank in the owner's absence. This study also eradicates the manual way of
changing the water whenever it becomes dirty and deadly for the fishes.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

These days, People have adapted technological modemizations in
caring and interacting with animal pets at their homes. The duty and
responsibility of the one Who feels fond of a pet make it strenuous to manage
their time. With the contemporary technologies in these times, people have
worked to take care of their pets automatically. Fishes are common animals to
be pet and used as hobbies or decorations at home and offices. It requires
enough food and adequate shelter for petting a fish. Its place must clean to
make it healthier and live a bit longer. A tank with a given volume is where the
fish will grow in a Specific maximum size (Moore et al., 1977). The size of the
tank depends on the quantity and dimensions of the fishes that place in it. The

bigger the fish will get or the more fish to be identified, the larger and the bigger
the tank will need.

The tank's water is renewed by freshwater being introduced tangentially
at a point along the tank's periphery and circulating slowly towards a centrally
Situated outlet (Pullola et al., 1987). The tank is required to have enough water
in buckets to fill it up. Doing it handiwork is a difficult task itself. Moreover,
whenever the fish needs to be fed, manual feeding must be done to pick and

drop exact amounts of fish food in the tank and be observed personally,

The development of the Internet of Things (loT) points to a change in
data gathering. A cumulative amount of data composed today is generated by

Therefore, the Proponents developed an Automated Aqua Scape Tank
using Raspberry Pj (lO) to aid people who have a pet shop and handle many
different animals. To minimize their tasks and for other individuals who love to

Keep a fish at their office or home but do not have enough time to take good

care of it, especially while they are away from their home.

1.2 Project Context

The Automated Aqua Scape Tank using Raspberry Pi (loT) intends to
contribute to the problems encountered by the people who keep or pet a fish.
The proposed study will be responsible for maintaining a clean and healthy
environment in fish tanks by doing it automatically. A common problem of a pet
owner in its aquarium was the monitoring of the fish. An automated aqua scape
tank will be able to help pet shops that sell plenty of fishes. Most of the fish
owners encountered the difficulty of manually removing and changing the water
on the tank and the struggle of feeding and monitoring the fishes. The proposed
project had an automatic and manual setup of time regarding the feeding of the
fishes. When it is set automatically, the fish food container will be released
based on the time the owner puts it. Furthermore, it will terminate an appropriate

amount of food depending on how many fishes are inside the tank.

"MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR BARANGAY WITH ANALYTIC AND
VISUALIZATION
","ABSTRACT

Computer technology has become a necessary component of modern life. Technology
is being used by people worldwide to make a variety of jobs more straightforward. The
government sector is where technology has made one of its most significant
contributions. The adoption of computer technologies has benefited many government
agencies greatly, notably barangay units.

The ""Management System for barangay with Analytic and Visualization"" capstone
project is intended for usage by barangays. The barangay's procedures and transactions
will be automated. The majority of the barangay traditionally conducts their daily
business using manual methods. They keep records using pen and paper and conduct
transactions in person. This approach is no longer appropriate in the current
technological era. It is ineffective at providing residents with satisfactory service and is

susceptible to human mistakes. Barangay and its citizens operate and perfonn
transactions needs to be improved.

The most effective way to address the aforementioned issues is via an IT-based
solution. The goal of the project is to develop an automated management system that
barangays can use to inform the populace through data visualization. It attempts to

1. Rationale of the Study

Technology has become a way of life for many people. (Statista Research
department, 2021) indicate that In the Philippines, 98 percent of internet users have
a smartphone, while just 77% have a laptop or desktop computer. Technology is the
most significant development in our society today and essential to advancing as we
go along in this direction. With time, modernity of every transaction spreads to
smaller groups like barangays and has a greater impact on how easily and

conveniently people can live their lives.

The computers' potential had not been fully utilized. Officials from the barangay
still use manual labor, not on machines, as their frontline of service and operations.
Technology like computers and smartphones is one of the tools to work from home.
Some rural area barangays are still doing traditional/manual recordings. The
research used Data analytics to simplify complex data and present it in a manner that
is easy to understand for users. Data Visualization has been part of this shift because
it enables data exploration and improves the final communication. You may be
aware of how much more impactful a visualization can be if you've ever tried to

discern a trend while looking at a huge spreadsheet of data.
The researchers came up with the idea of having a project which is a management
system for barangay with analytics and visualization. allowing the official of the
barangay to keep their resident record as complete and conveniently accessible for
verification, monitoring and references based available resident data. The
application disseminates information, uses it to develop and test system features,

"Web-Based Evaluation Examination with Strand Recommendation for
Incoming Senior High School Students
","iti

ABSTRACT

An evaluation examination is one of the requirements of the student for their
senior high school life. Before entering their selected school, students must take an
admission exam and, if necessary, a school evaluation. Exam papers are typically used
for admission exams. Traditional methods take time. The system will prepare test
questionnaires, which is too much paperwork and may be problematic during the
epidemic. Manual exams are inefficient and inconvenient. Pandemic days make it
unsafe to go outside; thus, students can take the admissions exam on their devices inside
or outside the school. The team has interview data. Exams will be multiple-choice.
Exams should be subject-specific. The Guidance Counselor will be in charge of the
student's participation in the exam, while the Psychometrician will be in charge of the
system; however, not all schools have a Psychometrician. The interviewee also
suggested a mixed-strand seminar on how the Web-based Evaluation Exam with Strand
Recommendation will guide them. Upon additional investigation, the team will employ
Standard Nine (Stanine) in computing exam results, a scaling mechanism suited for
turning scores into student skills and appropriate with the system's decision assistance
to recommend the strand.

NNVS does not have an existing system or web-based software that is easy to
use and a strand suggestion system. ACLC only uses a computerized test system that
lacks a strand recommendation system to help students choose their best suitable strand.
The study aims to build a school-wide Strand Recommendation system for high school
students. Proponents gathered user and system needs data to build this project. Data
was used to determine project goals. The proposed system recommends strands using a
stanine approach. The strand recommendations serve both the school and the students
by suggesting beneficial and acceptable strands for each student and making the
guidance staff's job easier. Proponents say the system is a massive help to high school
seniors. Use a strand-suggesting algorithm. After 1900, technology dominated our
lives. This paperless and entirely automated approach is advised for transforming the
exam into a high-quality strand recommendation system.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the study

The evaluation exam is considered a standard practice in various countries
worldwide, requiring students to take it before university (UniAssist, 2020). It is
mandatory for every person who wants to pursue their career (Jennifer, 2016).
Students from different universities, including elementary, high school, and
college, take an evaluation exam to test their capacity and skills before enrolling.

Its primary purpose is to judge a student's ability, sharpness, and knowledge

(Foundertalks, 2020).

The Department of Education in the Philippines introduced the k-12 curriculum
into the education system the Philippines (Wimsquad, 2018). It taught senior high
school, adding two more years of learning. Each student can choose a couple of
tracks before entering senior high school. These tracks are Academic, Technical-
Vocational-Livelihood, Sports, and Arts. The academic track includes three
strands, which are: Accounting, Business, and Management (ABM); Humanities
and Social Sciences (HUMSS); and Science, Technology, Engineering, and
Mathematics (STEM) (Gazette, 2020). Senior high school students must choose an
academic track they want to pursue. Choosing the right strand can lead to a better

pathway to college, which aligns with students’ passion; it is vital (Santos et al.,

2019).
It is a common problem that Senior High School students may regret their
chosen tracks. Their decisions are affected by peers, family influences, and self-
choice (Moneva, 2019). However, they could continue going to college without
aligning their track using the bridging program, but of course, it will take time and

money (Philippinesbasiceducation, 2018).

Despite offering a bridging program for students not aligning their track and
college degree to pursue, students still find it hard to continue college (Elsom,
Greenaway, Marshman, 2017). Only 45% of high school students feel confident

about college (EWA, 2020).

As a result, the researchers devised the concept of designing and developing a
web-based assisted evaluation examination for the upcoming senior high school
students and a list of strand recommendations and schools offering that strand.
Furthermore, to help those students who cannot or have difficulties deciding what
strand to choose in their senior high school life. In addition, it supports schools in
delivering accurate and faster checking than traditional manual checking of test

paper examinations.

the study, and the scopes and limitations
1.1 Rationale of the Study

People don't commonly doubt the large importance of hearing and vision in their
lives. Still, it's not uncommon for folks of disagree in talking concerning the importance
of the sense of smell/odor. Smell-producing product activities square measure a typical
a part of our daily lives and have an effect on each outside and indoor air quality. (Brian
Rohrig, 2016). Unpleasant odors from animal waste and fauna bodies are thought-about
indicators or warning signs indicating possible hazards to human health however not
essentially direct causes of negative health impacts. However, national Counsel for
complaints to public health organizations that odors might not merely function a caution
about possible dangers however that odor perceptions themselves could result in health
issues. A number of the health symptoms square measure induced of headache, nausea,
diarrhea, hoarseness, cough, chest tightness, nasal congestion, palpitations, shortness
of breath, tension, drowsiness, and mood swings are some of the symptoms. (Susan S.
Schiffman et al., 2015). there's additionally a positive impact on the farms wherever the
farmers used the waste and dead bodies of the animals as chemical to enhance the

fertility of cropland. it's a superb supply of nutrients to support the expansion of crops

(Fu et al., 2016).
According to the study of ATSDR, 2015, most out of doors odors that may
cause health symptoms to the shape come back from several sources. Sull, the highest
of the list is that the animals' BM and therefore the dead bodies of animals that humans
don't mind eliminating properly. Humans square measure exposed to pathogens from
poorly managed animal BM, significantly in communities wherever animals live about
to humans, particularly dogs and cats. Some dog and cat homeowners not removing
dog BM from the road might represent a haul for hygiene and public health ""Environ,""
2013. consistent with Sheshe Giddens, 2020, animal BM and animals' dead bodies
might contain odorless gases, like N, oxygen, hydrogen, carbonic acid gas, methane,
and, lastly, sulfide. sulfide (H2S) features a distinctive smell of rotten eggs. This gas
is made by bacteria's organic matter breaking down anaerobically, a typical element
of ""sewer gas.” however this gas doesn't cause disease; instead, once This substance's
molecules enter your nose, where they will attack the central systema nervosum. Our
sense of smell typically alerts USA to potential danger. unhealthy smells will function
a warning that one thing is wrong. if the odor unhealthy, it's in all probability unhealthy
for you. additional typically than not, the nose is aware of (Brian Rohrig, 2016).
consistent with Gauthami Penakalapti et al., 2017, humans square measure at risk if
exposed to animal BM. The animal's dead bodies are related to diarrhea, soil-
transmitted worm infection eye disease, environmental enteric pathology, and growth
faltering

Since these accidents may be preventable that we tend to square measure
already in AN innovative generation, the proponents determined to propose a study

that the there's a mini rover to fetch the animal BM out of doors so we will scale back
the human exposure to the animal BM with the employment of high-end innovative
technology entitled, ""KOLEK"" an outside mini Rover police work Camera with Foul
Smell assembling options exploitation Raspberry Pi.” a tool which will modify it to

"loT Smart Trash Bin With Level Notifier Using Arduino
","ABSTRACT

One of the major problems that the world is facing today is waste management.
Most of the time it is seen that the waste is been spilled over the bins and lying nearby.
This leads to the spreading of some deadly diseases in the surrounding environment.
Also, people find it difficult to walk beside it. All these problems, due to a lack of
coordination and communication among the garbage team members. Also, the study
has revealed that waste management can be far more efficient if the garbage is
segregated at the source and then disposed of in dumping grounds separately. Thus,
there is a big need to have proper waste management. Considering the above issues,
this paper proposes a prototype that will try to reduce these problems to a greater extent.
This system initially segregates the waste and then monitors the garbage level in bins
using IoT. This data related to the bin level is sent directly to the utility worker, where
the prototype processes the real-time data and raises alerts to manage the collection of
waste. The proposed prototype also takes care of the long time goal of identifying the
pattern of waste generation at various localities. This data collected by this prototype
can be used to further plan effective measures to reduce waste mismanagement and
maintain a cleaner environment.
","INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

In the age of advanced technology and electronics, the lifestyle of humans
should be smart, simpler, easier, and much more convenient. Therefore, there is a
need for many automated systems in human's daily routines. The scenario of waste
sorting or segregating of garbage is degrading tremendously. In the cities, the
immense population growth creates an unhygienic environment for the citizen of the
society, especially in public places where we can see garbage bins or trash cans
placed but unsegregated. This rapid growth of waste leads to various infectious
diseases in the environment, especially during this time of pandemic where people
can be possibly infected with different viruses from the garbage bins by holding or

touching the bin's lid to throw their trash.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

In early 2020, after a December 2019 outbreak in China, the
World Health Organization identified SARS-Co\V-2 (Severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 of the genus Betacoronavirus) as a
new type of coronavirus. It can affect the upper respiratory tract (sinuses,
nose, and throat) or lower respiratory tract. It is deadly and now spreads
the same way that other coronaviruses do, mainly through person-to-
person contact. This pandemic severely affects many countries and
causes problems to mankind. The potential long-term consequences of
the pandemic could have for us are starting to reveal themselves in the
people's daily lives. Schooling becomes online to avoid person to person
contact, establishments that sell necessities are controlled to operate,
which affects the economy and decreases workforce, travelers, and
commuters. They need to undergo checkpoints to ensure that
requirements to pass border to border are implemented and met.
Scientists said the coronavirus is like a droplet and is not airborne (China
Daily via Reuters, 2020). According to the World Health Organization,
coronaviruses, including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus,
may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. On the
other hand, one of the most effective ways to fight the coronavirus's
spread is to disinfect the positively touched surfaces and parts of the

body. Public-health experts think that mass disinfection efforts will have
mixed effectiveness in outbreak zones. One of our locality’s focus is to
disinfect people passing through cross borders to prevent the spread of
the virus from communities. That is why every cross-border control
makes sure to facilitate disinfection for commuters and travelers in every
boundary to avoid local transmission. However, problems still occur in
doing the manual process of sanitizing people passing through borders.
Instances like remains of the virus droplets can stick on bottles of the
hand sanitizers and travel assessment checklist provided by the cross-
border control unit. The travel assessment checklist is required to survey
the passers crossing the border control's condition and connection,
serving as a record for contact tracing. According to Greiner A. et al.
(2015), because the travel assessment checklist is done manually
through a piece of paper, it causes delay and ineffectiveness of contact
tracing, contributing to the extensive transmission of diseases.
Challenges have been evident in every step of the contact tracing
process from implementation to management, including identifying,
locating, enrolling contact-persons and, managing personnel, and
ensuring contact tracing performance. A paper data questionnaire could
also be a source of virus transmission. Though some are now using a
UV light for eliminating the virus, the process is still a hassle and time
consuming to the people crossing the borders. Therefore, the
proponents decided to develop the Sanitation and Disinfection System
for Cross Border Control with Data Collection Facility as an Aid for
Contact Tracing that would automate the disinfection and sanitation

process on cross border controls that need no direct person to person
interaction and records information from people passing through the
borders as an aid for contact tracing. This study starts from the collection
of the data of a person who will pass through the border control by
scanning the QR ID provided by the local government unit, and the
system prototype will automatically record the passer’s information into
the database. And the travelers will also answer the travel assessment
checklist that is already translated into English, Tagalog, and Cebuano,
answerable either “YES/NO,” OO/HINDI,” OO/WALA presented on a
monitor visible to the passer. After that, the passer is now ready to enter
the proposed cabin prototype for the disinfection process through a mist
sanitizer. Through this study, we can make sure that the sanitation and
disinfection of every person who crosses the border control are correctly
implemented in no need for a person to person direct contact. Contact
tracing would also be comfortable, accurate, and safe because the data

that the database will gather will be accessible at any point needed.

Moreover, this system will aid the government's work for the public

preventive measures for the citizens' safety and the prevention of

COVID-19 transmission.

GESTURE TO TEXT TRANSLATION AS AN AID FOR “HEARING
IMPAIRED PERSON”
","ABSTRACT

Deaf people have difficulty in communicating with others who don’t
understand signing. HandTalk: A Mechanical and Sensing Device for Hand
Gesture to Text Translation as an Aid for “Hearing Impaired Person” has been
developed to assist the non-verbal people to speak. This study involves a
glove with flex sensors that output a text that varies with the degree of bend
made by the fingers. Flex sensors are sensors that change in resistance
counting on the quantity of bend on the sensor. The text will display on LCD
upon bending. The proponents conducted a survey from verbal individuals for
the testing of the prototype, and was acceptable supported the entire mean
obtained of 4.158. The prototype was indeed useful for a hearing impaired
person. During this project, the hardware that used are Arduino, LCD display

(i2c 16x2), flex sensor, breadboard.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

Many Deaf communities worldwide face inequalities once it involves
accessing health data and health care services. Health information and
services are usually not on the market in an accessible format. As 4 result,
Deaf people often have low health acquisition and are at more significant risk
of being misdiagnosed or not diagnosed within the least. Over the past few
decades, a noteworthy psychological dynamic has arisen. Today, some deaf
constituencies have had a strong reaction to the perception of the deaf as
pathology (Leigh, Andrews, 2017). Particularly inside the past few decades,
proponents of hearing misfortune as a culture have announced that hearing
loss isn't a pathology and thus does not ought to be fixed(Jones M., 2016).
The deaf community isn't a later wonder, neither is it an obsolete conception.
The deaf community is also a time-tested solution that supports deaf people
to live a top of the range life. It's been alive since the primary 1700s were first
established in Europe to rescue deaf people from an educational and non-
secular vacuum. When deaf people began to congregate at these schools, a
replacement community of people was created among those who found that
that they had an analogous orientation towards life - visual direction
(Holcomb, 2020).

Problems with deaf people often begin when making a gathering. Since
a few GPs exclusively allow arrangements to remodeled the phone, a few of

those we met had to physically get to a particular area to inquire about an

assembly. This is inconvenient, but actual educational learning without an
interpreter might also be complicated and confusing. Deaf communities
around the world face several similar challenges to autochthonal people
around the world. As indigenous peoples, deaf individuals are usually
politically and socially isolated, have fewer educational and skilled
opportunities, and have restricted access to data and public service (Ketchell,
2019). Ongoing advances in visual, auditory, and neurological technologies
like brain imaging are also profoundly impacted (Leigh, Andrews, 2017). Hard
of hearing individuals have risk factors, just like the deprivation of early
communication and language, which successfully delay cognitive and socio-
emotional growth, often resulting in social isolation, literacy, and emotional
and behavioral problems (Leigh, Andrews, Harris, 2018). These factors
combined with poverty can compound the deaf child's vulnerability for abuse,
neglect, and maltreatment (Lomas, Andrews, Shaw, 2017).

Sign language is that the tongue of prelingually deaf people,
particularly without hearing-speech rehabilitation. Otorhinolaryngologists,
regarding health as complete physical, mental and psychosocial wellbeing,
aim hearing by diagnosing deafness as deviance from normality (Kemaloglu,
Kemaloglu, 2012). Sign dialects are entirely linguistic living dialects with no
vocal component and are irrelevant to the countries' dominant spoken
languages during which they're used (Oram, Napier, 2019). When hard of
hearing individuals from diverse countries meet, they're able to associate
straightforwardly by drawing on their existing knowledge of a marked dialect
to smoothly discover a commonality of expression and understanding inside a
Similar visual syntactic structure across different signed languages (Kusters,

Spotti, Swanwick, &Tapio, 2017; Zeshan, 2017, Zeshan& Panda, 2018).

The proponents have decided to develop a HandTalk, which can

translate the signing into the text to make sure effective communication can

quickly happen.

"AUTOMATED CANINE CAPTURE SYSTEM WITH GPS
","ABSTRACT

An Automated Canine Capture System with GPS for capturing stray
dogs on isolated or prone areas where a stray dogs usually spotted in the city
using GPS to locate and identify status of the cage. The system has two
primary functions, one is to capture the stray dog with a strong cage and
second is to notify the admin with a photo captured inside the cage when the
trap is activated and then receive a SMS message of the status of the cage
with location. Once a stray dog activated the trap the door will closed by
releasing the servo motor that holds the door of the cage. A photo will be send
to the admin website using a camera located above the cage after the trap is
activated. The admin then receives a SMS message about the status and

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

In most cities of the country, there are stray dogs in every area. The
cause of these are owners who are just letting them roam free. These strays
can thrive as long as the conditions are met, which are food from garbage and
the abundance of a mate through other strays. This activity can lead to an
exponential growth of the stray dog population. Unvaccinated dogs may lead
to problems if left unchecked, such as the rapid spread of rabies accidents,
which is mostly caused by stray's aggressive behavior towards the populace.

According to.

Republic Act (RA) 9482, known as the Anti-Rabies Act of 2007, the law
also states that a stray dog can be impounded if it is found that it has no
owner for the safety of bystanders. This law was made in line with the policy

of the State to establish responsible pet ownership.

With regards to making sure that dog owners will be responsible for
their pets at the same time, RA 9482 states that both the dog owner and even
the local government units had been mandated to be responsible for caring
for dogs. According to Section 5 (c) of this law, to avoid accidents from
happening, it is the responsibility of the pet owners to maintain contro! over
their dogs and not to allow them to roam the streets or any public place

without a leash.

While local government units (LGUs) are responsible for making sure

that dogs are leashed or confined within the premises of a dog owner's house
or fenced surroundings(Section 7,(3), Ibid.), the LGUs were strictly

responsible for enforcing dog impounding and field control of controlling stray

dog population (Section 7(2), Id.).

A dog can be considered as a stray dog, leaving the owner's house and
walking without any evidence that it has an owner like a collar or leash
(Section 3(p), Id.) Therefore, The personnel decided to develop a system for a
device that may be of service of assisting on the detainment of these potential
hazards to the people by the implementation of automated cages that would
ensure a safe detainment of the animal whilst ensuring, in turn, it cannot harm
the agents that are assigned for said detainment unit while the potentially

dangerous animal is retrieved and impounded.

","ABSTRACT

An Implementation of Kemistri: An e-learning Web-based Application for
Chemical Elements has been prepared by the proponents for its goal of
developing an E-learning for chemical elements that enable teachers and
students access the study by exploring and knowing the periodic table elements
and its combinations. In addition, its purpose is to give an ease and lend help
to students specifically knowing what combinations of compounds and what will

Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for this method; it is very useful in identifying
errors. The proponents used PHP language and jQuery. PHP has a general-
purpose language that is especially suited to web development on the other
hand, jQuery is a plugin for the drag and drop function of the system. The
proponents conducted a survey result and got a result of 4.225. The result
proves that the software is indeed useful and helpful to the students, also using
this system helps you save from chaos if you’re having a hard time working with
computations in compounds and knowing more about it.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 The Rationale of the Study

Nowadays, universities and educational institutions are under pressure
from various sides to update their teaching and learning technologies from
chalkboard and paper, which is the traditional teaching, to something called e-
learning. Educators and doctors of education also spend most of their time
researching, finding the best ways to upgrade the quality of learning in terms of
techniques, methods, and pedagogy approaches in all learning areas or
subjects.

One of the many school subjects that most of the students find difficult
is science, specifically its branch - Chemistry. One of the main problems of
science teachers is finding various learning strategies that would help meet the
educational needs of diverse learners. Anent to this, the use of educational
technology, including visual, audio, verbal, and interactive learning, provides a
well-organized learning environment to promote and enhance individualized
learning. As the introductory quotation shows, e-learning is seen to make more

efficient use of the available resources.

Although the periodic table is a foundational topic in chemistry,
educators have found it difficult to teach the periodic table and its related
concepts. Despite its practicality as a conceptual tool for the organization of
the chemical elements and understanding their properties, most teachers
experience difficulties teaching it. (Mokiwa et al., 2009) The issues of what

kind of knowledge is adequate for making effective instructional decisions or
2

designing appropriate learning environments are on current research agendas
worldwide (Malcolm & Alant, 2004). The said kind of learning and difficulties in

teaching the said topic gives way to the researchers’ study.

Therefore, the proponent decided to develop ""An Implementation of
Kemistri: An e-learning Web-based Application for Chemical Elements” that will
ease and lend help to students in knowing what combinations of compounds
and what will be its result. Besides, the system can give further information
based on the result of combined elements. The study is of significant

importance to the learners as well as to the teachers.

"MATH GT: A Motorcycle Anti-Thief with Helmet Alcohol Detection and
GPS Tracker
","ABSTRACT

Nowadays, the motorcycle is the primary way of transportation, and most
of the countries, especially the Philippines, are enforcing their cities to wear a
helmet when driving a bike. In Caraga Region, According to the traffic section
police station in Butuan City. Seventy-two accidents are recorded in 2017
because the person is under the influence of an alcohol. She/he is not allowed
to drive, but still, these rules are being violated, and one of the major problems
is the increasing rate of motor vehicle theft in the country. The study sought to
develop and incorporate the use of (MATH GT) A Helmet Alcohol Detection
Motorcycle Anti-Thief and GPS Tracker in riding a motorcycle. It has an
intelligent device installed in the helmet and the vehicle, using the (MATH GT)
cell phone application to operate and control the system, has a theft safety
system. It communicates with the vehicle units to switch off the ignition and
alarming system of the vehicle if there is a threat or if it is in a dangerous
situation, the helmet alcohol detector ensures that the rider is not in the
influence of alcohol with the help of the (MQ3) alcohol sensor. Using the (GPS
gf-07), the rider can be traced immediately if an accident or the motorcycle has
been stolen. This system aims to help our fellow riders ensure their safety and
assist them in their protection and motorcycle. The proponents decided to use
the Rapid Application Development model, which involves fast phase
development with an iterative process. The proponents also used Survey
Questionnaire as a tool for data gathering. The survey resulted in a mean Of
2.50 on the overall statement that the prototype is High Functional.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Project context

from statistic during the same period
from the previous year with only a little 2500 units were taken. According to the
Highway Patrol Group (HPG), about 150 motorcycles are stolen every week in
Metro Manila alone, or an estimated average of 21 per day. The spokesman
superintendent Elizabeth Velazquez of HPG also stated that in 2014, 11, 870
motorcycles were Stolen, while 10, 771 were taken in 2013. In Caraga Butuan
City, based on the record of the Traffic Section of Butuan City Police, 74
accidents are recorded in 2017 due to drunk driving. According to the recent
study, Motorcycle Theft Prevention and Recovery Security System (Publish in
2017) by Archie O. Pachica, Dhave S. Barsalote, Jessy Mae P. Geraga,

Jhestine M. Ong, and Michael D. Sajulan. Transportation plays a big part in our

daily lives. Every year, people in the Philippines are increasingly using vehicles,
especially motorcycles, as their common means of transportation. Together
with the increase of motorcycle users, motorcycle theft is also rampant over the
years. Their study developed a system for the theft prevention and recovery of
the motorcycle more comfortably and faster. The user will be noticed through
an alert once the motorcycle has been moved in a long-distance or stolen. The
user could also view the current location, shut down the engine, and capture
the thief's image. The hardware component includes a micro-controller, GSM,
GPS, and a camera. The software component is the mobile application, which
is the medium of communication of the user to the motorcycle and serves as
the main controller of their entire system. To differentiate from the previous
research, we use the GPS, GSM, and Microcontroller to prevent motorcycle
theft. The proposed of the MATH GT is to notify the owner when the motorcycle

has been stolen. And reduce road accidents due to alcohol intake.

modalities. However, the education department emphasizes that no face-to-
face learning delivery for this school year adherence to the Inter-Agency Task
Force (IATF). This means that education institutions will have to make the most

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background of the Study

In the wake of COVID-19, the Commission on Higher Education
(CHED) and the Department of Education (DepEd) deliberately help how
classes from all levels will be directed by our new normal. Classes with
physical contact are suspended, and private online classes are currently the
methods for educating. Making and observing all the understudies' tests in a
class is now tiring and tedious for instructors, and still, they need to make their
essential arrangements for educating the students. The advocates inferred
that the basic issue in online classes besides the web, accessibility of
contraptions and the information on utilizing on the web stages is that
instructors make tests and then upload it to the web and monitors all the
students' exams through manual checking in a class and send feedbacks to
the understudies individually.

Item analysis is a process that looks at student reactions to individual
test items (questions) to survey the nature of those things and the test in
general. It is an important, great strategy accessible to showing experts and
teachers the direction and improvement of guidelines. This strategy
empowers teachers to expand their test development aptitudes, recognize
explicit territories of the course content which need more noteworthy
accentuation or clarity, and improve other homeroom practice Item analysis
also is a statistical technique which is used for selecting and rejecting items of
the test based on their D.V. and discriminated power. Item analysis is

accomplished for acquiring DV (Difficulty Value) and D.P. (Discriminative
Power). The difficulty value or D.V. of an item is defined as the proportion or
percentage of the examinees who have answered the item correctly.

According to the revelations of the investigation of Sirri and Freddano
(2011), in the standardized and target appraisal of understudy shows, the
thing assessment is a cycle wherein the two understudies’ answers and test
questions are investigated to review the quality and measure of the things and
the test generally. Khan, Ishrat, and Khan (2015) communicated that item
examination is proposed for students’ arrangement level by surveying the
requests given in evaluation.

According to Asst. Prof. Anabella C. Doctor, Information Technology
and Information System Department, Adamson University, Philippines and Dr.
Carmelita H. Benito Information Technology and Information System
Department, Adamson University, Philippines Item Analysis Is a@ factual
method that causes personnel and foundations to assess the quality and wipe
out deceiving test things remembered for a test given and taken by the
understudies.

According to Kennedy Quaigrain and Ato Kwamina Ahren, /tem
analysis is fundamental in improving things, which will utilize it again in later
tests; it can likewise use it to dispose of deluding item in a test. The
examination zeroed in on thing and test quality and investigated the
connection between trouble record (p-worth) and segregation list (DI) with
distractor effectiveness (D.E.).

Accordingly, item banking is a very convenient tool for the educational
system to monitor academic achievement. Advanced and sophisticated

computer software further enhances the possibilities towards high calibrated
item banks. In light of the discoveries of the investigation of Razak et al.
(2011), and all-around created computerized item bank empowers the
educators to plan the ideal test, and the instructors can tailor each test to their
nearby instructive targets and consider who is to be estimated without losing
contact with the regular center of bank things.

According to Quaigrain and Arhin (2017), item analysis is the exhibition
of items thought about exclusively, either corresponding to some outer mode!
or comparable to the test's excess items.

According to Sir Pits Onez(2020), Dean of the General Education
department at ACLC College of Butuan. To achieve item analysis, you must
follow the standard equation to evaluate the question correctly and have a fair
judgment. He added in item analysis; it covers all test types. From our brief
interview with Sir Ofiez, we have determined that the most critical component
in an Item Analysis is DV (Difficulty Value) and DI! (Discrimination Index).
Utilizing the two standards together, we can assess whether the test question
fs simple, hard, or troublesome and if it needs further improvement.

To differentiate our proposed system for previous software such as
quiz generator, question banking, our system can create tests, automate
student test checking, and incorporate item analysis and test banks for the
reliability and validity of the test. Creating and uploading the students’ tests is
very tiring and tedious for the educators, for they will even now make the PDF
format then upload it to the site, which is excessive for internet data.
Therefore, the proponents agreed to develop a system where teachers can
create test questionnaires or quizzes on the web and the answer key and

automatically check the student's answered test. The questions per test item
will be categorized and evaluated according to their difficulty level through
item analysis. Before the test questionnaire moves to the test bank, the
instructor's test will be submitted and assessed by the administrator.

The proponents develop a project entitled ""Q-Gen: A Web-Based
Comprehensive Test Creator For All Field Of Study With Item Analysis
Feature"" that instructors can make their questionnaires along with the
appropriate response key, consequently checks the student test/tests with a
tally of every test item in all test types and incorporates test banking.

The system is intended to solve the gap of the existing systems
mentioned above and improve the quality of the items on a test, so educators
can improve the test's general nature, henceforth improving both the
unwavering quality and legitimacy of making such a test. The system to be
created by the defenders needs to utilize PHP as Web interface back-end and
bootstrap, HTML, CSS, java content for the front-end plan, and MYSQL for
the database. Through this, we can diminish the outstanding burden of our
dear instructors in making, checking, and monitoring the tests/quizzes of
students’ inside the class and causes them to embrace and focus on their
teaching and give relevant ideas to the students to improve their studies in
this new sort of learning. To encourage information dividing between the
understudies and improve the educators' capacities to comprehend the

students’ concem in their assessments and give successful and solid tests for

students.

ABSTRACT

MobWork — A mobile Application for Services to Home Transaction — A
mobile application that helps the client/customers to find or request available
services by a reliable service provider in their local area that are experts and
laborers within the line of job. The mobile application requires you to register
as a client/customer or service provider and verify by verification code. The
client/customers search for a service provider, after finding service provider
the client/customers locate the address of the service provider using google
map and contacts the service provider, and offers an amount for the specific
services. The service provider will receive a request notification and with the
location of client/customers using google maps with the amount of the service.
The Proponents used the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
Incremental Approach. This model is appropriate for the development of the
system since there can be many changes throughout the development stage
of the system. When the survey was released and finished the results were
tabulated and found out that the developed system received positive feedback
from the respondents of the study. The developed system was highly
accepted and efficient to the users based on the total mean of 4.44 gathered
from the |SO-1926-1 Survey Questionnaire. The proponents conclude that the

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Project Context

Jobs, whether smail or big, are everywhere. Finding the right person for
that specific job is a lot more work than making the actual appointment. And
finding a reliable worker is much more difficult. In this time where everyone
competes for a job, finding a reliable and competent person is a job on its

own.

The proponents propose a mobile application idea that will assist
people in their demand to find a reliable and competent service provider with
technical expertise that ranges from electronic services, menial services,
health and pampering services, and school or Study-related services. Through
this application, anyone, granted that they are an expert, can offer assistance
where people can access and view the information on the availability of the

needed services they are looking for it.

The descriptive method of research that will be used in the Study are
Surveys and Interviews, which will be conducted to identify the standard
, services needed by the people who will be accessing the benefits that this
application will be providing, the services people want to provide, the time
they want the service must be provided and other relevant information for
verification. To find the standard services needed by the people, a Survey will
be conducted to gather enough information to generate a rank of the most

requested services. To access these services, a careful €xamination must be
2
completed too. The needed information for a person needing the benefits and
the services provider must be carefully researched to minimize the data

required and avoid hassle when a service is urgently required.

Apart from the point by which the concept was materialized, conceptual
information that will be identified and utilized, technical knowledge on
application development is also required for this project. It is expected that the
proponents will use theories and concepts of PHP, internet and network
Technologies, Google Map, mobile computing technologies, computer
programming, and various software And hardware platforms. All of these are

deemed necessary for the making of the project.

have already inhabited the area. Reports accounted that they have lived a
simple life, practicing harmony with the forests through their culture and
traditions. They farmed crops, hunted wild animals, and carried out rituals
and tribal celebrations for the Magbabaya (the Creator). Lasting for more
than four decades, the tribe was a witness to the damage caused by the
massive deforestation at that time, including the decline of wildlife such as
the usa (deer), amo (monkey), ayaw (hornbill), milo (wild cats), or the
complete loss of species in the area such as the Banug (Philippine eagle),
which can no longer be spotted today. The Manobo have also reported
lower water levels, more down fish catch, and a warmer climate. The
passing of the Indigenous Peoples (IPs) Rights Act and the creation of the
National Commission of Indigenous People in 1997 paved the way for the
Manobo tribe members to organize their association, which enabled them
to protect the forest, their ancestral domain, and rights, and to preserve
their cultural way of life. (Zambas, 2019).

Illegal mining and other activities were very devastating towards the
ancestral land of the Manobos; fortunately, there has been action taken
with the example when two tribal chieftains in Surigao Del Norte have
asked the Office of the Ombudsman to investigate Surigao Del Sur Rep.
Prospero Pechay and seven others for conspiracy to illegally mine,
transport and sell nickel ores from their ancestral lands. The complainants
are Datu James Biol and Datu Reynante Buklas of the Manobo tribe,

respectively. In a graft and grave abuse of authority complaint, they
accused Pechay of conspiring with Mines and Geosciences Bureau
Officials in allowing the illegal mining activity in Bgy. Taganito, Claver,
Surigao Del Norte (Bonquin, 2016).

In this day and age, mobile gaming has been a massive part of
everyone's life, including the youth; using this as an advantage, the

","ABSTRACT

Covid-19 is a pandemic disease that erupted and exploded at the end
of 2019.The start of 2020. Centered on the WHO's declaration (World Health
Organization), the virus has now spread to more than 20 nations and
territories around the world. The Covid19 virus spreads mainly by saliva
droplets or nose discharge.

Studies have been conducted for monitoring local residence accessing

three colors, black, red, and blue, that represent which scheduled people are
allowed to enter the establishments. Each code has a unique ID to identify if
the person is authorized to enter an establishment. This approach can serve
as a reliable solution to the public crisis on this pandemic.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background of the Study

The covid-19 is a pandemic disease that exploded at the end of 2019 and
the beginning of 2020. Based on WHO (World Health Organization) statement,
the virus has now Spread to over 20 countries and territories worldwide. The
covid19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the
nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes. A novel strain of coronavirus
was rst detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, a city in China.

In these days of an outbreak, many have studied contact tracing to
prevent the spreading of COVID-19: for this reason, the contact tracing has been
presented using smartphones, Bluetooth connectivity, or GPS location history of
performing the contact tracing. Also, developing a BubbleBox system composed
of a wearable device, a wristband, to Under the protected social gap between the
person who wears it and other people, trace all contacts. The wristband is
responsible for outlining the connections- it generates a unique id.

However, The DOH (Department of Health) 13 (CARAGA) has conrmed
local transmission of the coronavirus disease 2019 after reporting new infections
in Butuan City. Due to these developments, Loca! Government Units (LGUs)
strictly implement the health protocols to contain the spread of Covid-19. To

reduce the chance of propagation of the 2019-NCOV, the city government of
Butuan has issued a new color-coding scheme to control the movement of

people. The color-coding quarantine pass, residents carrying black colored
quarantine passes can go out only on Monday and Tuesday. Residents with
Blue quarantine passes can only go out on Tuesday and Friday. At the same
time, those with Red quarantine passes can go out on Wednesday and Saturday
to buy basic needs. Senior citizens, PWD, and pregnant women may go out on
Sunday. Front liners with their quarantine passes are exempted in the
colorcoding scheme. Implementing quarantine passes in a piece of paper is not
enough to control the spreading of coronavirus. Based on this matter, the
proponents decided to conduct research and studies, which leads them to create
a system application for monitoring local residence accessing to establishments
as an aid for contact tracing and data analytics.
Therefore, the proponents decided to develop a system application for

monitoring residents accessing establishments to aid contact tracing and data
analytics to watch those people going inside the shopping malls, barangay, and
any other establishments using IDs that have QR codes. Instead of using a piece
of paper, the old quarantine passes replace an ID with a QR code. Residents will
be trace by those codes and quickly contact those exposed in the area where
there are positive cases. Through this, we can control the people going in and
out in our barangays and city. We know that the COVID-19 pandemic has spread
like wildre across the world. Few countries manage to keep it well-control. To

prevent the spread of virus infections, we will build a system to control its spread.

1.2 Purpose and Description

This study aims to create a system that will monitor the local residence as

support for contact tracing with data visualization. The proponents aim to provide
a technological solution to reduce the virus spreading and notify the Butuan City
residence if someone enters the establishment that is probably COVID-19

positive.

","ABSTRACT

Wireless sensor network applications in the agriculture sector are
gaining popularity with the advancement of the Internet of Thing technology.
Predominantly, wireless sensor networks are used in agriculture to sense the
important agriculture field parameters, such as temperature, humidity, soil
moisture level, salinity level, and so on. Technically, the Internet of Thing (loT)
is responsible for technologically enhancing day to day activities. Rice
production in the Philippines is an important aspect of the country’s food
supply and economy. The Philippines is the 8"" largest rice production in the
world, accounting for 2.8% of global rice production. By this reason, the
proponents conducted the study entitled Rice field automation system
embedding moisture and salinity detection with notification and irrigation

functionalities of irrigation, an important function of the prototype is to detect
moisture and salinity level. The system can trigger the water pump whether it
is automatic or manual, in manual procedure the farmer can on and off the
water pump without the condition of TDS sensor and off in a certain time and
in automatic parts, the irrigation will trigger if he didn’t detect any moisture in
the soil for a certain time with the help of web application. The system also
sends information daily through SMS notification to update the farmer.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

Rice production in the Philippines is an essential aspect of the
country's food supply and economy. The Philippines are one of the countries
still using the traditional way of farming. In most of the rice-farming industries,
manual monitoring and watering have been employed. The farmer needs to
monitor the soil's moisture manually, but it's hard for them to monitor the
water's saline level. According to Dr. M.B Sturgis, head, LSU Department of
Agronomy, saltwater can become a problem in rice production, especially in
some areas in dry years. A small amount of saltwater is not dangerous to rice
at any stage of growth. Higher concentrations affect the existing crop and can
cause a build-up of salt in the soil. Rice grown on soils relatively free of salt is
tolerant to salt water with 35 grains (600 parts per million) per gallon of
sodium chloride. This problem encountered the Philippines' farmers due to
lack of equipment and knowledge about technology, especially those in a

small industry. Water is an essential part of plant growth for about 60%.

Therefore, the soil moisture content (soil moisture) as a medium for
growing plants is essential in agricultural cultivation. The availability of water
becomes the primary determinant in the production of agricultural
commodities. According to Dobermann A, Fairhurst T. 2000 salinity affects the
respiration and photosynthesis of plants. It decreases biological N2 fixation
and soil nitrogen mineralization. Its other effects on rice growth include
reduced germination rate, reduced plant height and tillering low root growth,

and increased spikelet sterility. The problem also related to the requirement of
human resources to perform manual activities, and during the watering
season, rice fields were manually watered. Again, not all owners can monitor
their crops from time to time. Based on this matter, the proponents decided to
conduct research and studies, which leads them to create a rice field
automation system embedding moisture and salinity detection with notification

and irrigation control facility.

By and large, automating and monitoring rice fields and their status on
their specific identifying elements becomes a necessity. This then leads the
proponents to propose a system that will automate a rice field that embeds its

soil moisture and salinity detection features with notification and irrigation

control mechanism.

INTRODUCTION

The rationale of the study

Waste management is one of the primary problems that the world faces,
irrespective of developing or developed countries. The main issue in waste management
is that the garbage bins at public places get overflowed well in advance before the next
cleaning process's commencement. Problem: The current system for waste management
includes numerous stages with a massive workforce. Every time laborers have to visit the
garbage bins in the city area to check whether they are filled. And if they are filled,
garbage bins are collected and disposed of at the closest landfill. If garbage bins are not
sealed, then the workforce invested goes in vain. A city like Caraga has a population of
1,596,709 (2015), projected to grow more by 2027. And as the population increases, the
waste generated by them will proportionally increase. Currently, about 250 to 460 tonnes

of waste is produced daily in Caraga. (Alden Pantaleon Jr. / MindaNews)

This paper aims to provide an overview of the voluntary approaches towards
enhancing the design of a smart dustbin to implement advanced waste management
systems. In most places, the barangay garbage bins are overflowing, and they are not
cleaned at the proper time. As a result of which the consequences are severe. It includes
overflow of garbage, which results in land pollution, the spread of diseases, and creates
unhygienic conditions for people and horror in that place. There needs to system that
gives preliminary information on the bin's filling that alerts the municipality to clean the
container on time and safeguard the environment. To avoid all such situations, we intend
to propose a solution for this problem, ""Smart Garbage Bin,"" which will alarm and inform
the authorized person by a buzzer and alert system when the garbage bin is about to fill.

This paper's main objective is to propose a plan to reduce human effort and resources
along with the enhancement of smart city vision and maintain a pollution-free environment
around our homes and especially in public places, (L.A. Guerrero, G Ger, H William,
""Solid waste management challenges for cities in developing countries,"" Garbage

Management, vol. 33, no. 1, pp. 220-232, January 2013.)

There shall be established a Material Recovery Facility (MRF) in every barangay
or cluster of barangays. The facility shall be installed in a barangay-owned or leased land
or any suitable open space to be determined by the barangay through its Sanggunian.
For this purpose, the barangay or cluster of barangays shall allocate a specific parcel of
land for the MRF. The site's determination and the actual establishment of the facility shall
likewise be subject to the guidelines and criteria set according to this Act. The inhabitants
of barangay face several issues. One of them is domestic solid waste disposal, which
causes pollution; the barangay's waste disposal bins or MRF are shared among all
residents who live in the same barangay, and thus, the bins tend to be filled very quickly.
Therefore, a system of inefficient disposal waste management may cause the containers
to be always full of garbage.

Further littering from the residents will cause the garbage piles to be scattered
outside the bins. Therefore, there will be a sanitary question as those garbage piles may
become the root cause of illness and diseases like dengue, diarrhea, and cholera. An
increase in waste leads to many health problems, and also the gases produced from
wastes lead to air pollution and spreads diseases. (By Sara Mae D. Mawi's -
@inquirerdotnet, Philippine Daily Inquirer / 03:26 AM May 18, 2019,
http://nswmc.emb.gov.ph)

Waste mismanagement has serious environmental effects, making the Republic Act
(R.A.) 9003 or the Ecological Solid Waste Management act of 2000 a landmark

environmental legislation in the Philippines. The law was crafted in response to looming
garbage problems in the country. RA 9003 declares the policy of the state in adopting a
systematic, comprehensive, and ecological reliable waste management program that
ensures the protection of public health and the environment and the process of
segregation, transport, storage, treatment, and disposal of solid waste through the
formulation and the adoption of best environmental practices. Moreover, it illustrates the
potentials and benefits of recycling in addressing waste management problems and
alleviating poverty. The Philippine Congress passed RA 9003 on December 20, 2000
The President's office subsequently approved it on January 26, 2001; it contains seven
chapters subdivided into 66 sections setting out policy direction for an effective, reliable
waste management program in the country. (FFTC Agricultural Policy Platform(FFTC-
AP) Food Fertilizer Technology for the Asian and Pacific Region Solid Waste
Management Act ).

To address this problem, the proponents decided to develop a system for
monitoring trash bins that would frequently monitor the garbage level inside the container
and detect the Hydrogen sulfide gas inside the trash bin with automatic door, and
notification features Using Raspberry pi. The development project can see when the trash
bin is full and detect the hygiene level present inside the trash bin. It monitors the waste
level, and the notifications are sent to the workers through an android app when the
container is full. This device is a smart trash bin with a lid that opens automatically using

a sensor.

INTRODUCTION

Rice is the staple food of Asia and part of the Pacific. Over 90 percent of
the world’s rice is produced and consumed in the Asia-Pacific Region.
According to the Department of Agriculture Caraga Regional Office they can
detect diseased rice plant and pest infestation in rice plant by their application.
After they detected the possible rice field that have the most infested rice plant,
they will coordinate to the owner of the rice field and they will tell if how many
percentage of the rice field has being infested but according to the farmer Mr.
Reynaldo B. Roperos, resident in Barangay Bading, said that they don’t have
any connection with the Department of Agriculture, they only do things by their
own and they could only know if the rice plant is infested by a pest is only by
touching the leaves and by checking manually with their eyes.

A pest infestation on rice plant has always resulting in enormous anxiety
on farmers because of the damaged has been cost on their rice plants. For the
past few years’ farmers have experience a difficulty on identifying on what
possible disease and pest the rice plant may have. Nowadays, they manually
monitor the rice plant through picking up some example and uses their hands
to identify the possible disease and pest that attacks on it.

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nation (UN) that
the common problem encountered by rice farmers were high cost of inputs,
low price of palay, lack of capital, labour problem, lack of postharvest, facilities,
irrigation system and the most common problem when the different pest’s are
destroying the production of rice during wet season, it causes leaf discoloration,

stunted growth, reduced tiller numbers and sterile or partly filled grains, infected
leaves turn greyish green and roll up. As the disease progresses, leaves turn
yellow to straw-colored and wilt, leading whole seedlings to dry up and die, and
It attacks different parts of the plant: the collar, which can ultimately kill the
entire leaf blade; the stem, which turns blackish and breaks easily (node blast);
the neck of the panicle, where the infected part is girdled by a greyish brown
lesion, or when severe, causes the panicles to fall over; or on the branches of
the panicles which exhibit brown lesions when infected(AGRIS et al., 2009).

1.1 Introduction

In 2019, a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 has been rapidly
spreading and resulted in a respiratory illness known as COVID-19. The
epidemic has spread to over 210 countries, with over 2,400,000 confirmed
cases and over 170,000 deaths. COVID-19 causes severe pneumonia
characterized by fever, cough, and shortness of breath (Am Med, 2020).
According to WHO (World Health Organization), there are no specific
vaccines/treatments for COVID-19 patients. However, there are many process
clinical trials evaluating the possibilities of treatments. Unfortunately, there is
no comprehensive summary of the multiorgan manifestations of COVID-19,
making it difficult for clinicians to educate themselves about this highly

contagious and deadly pathogen quickly.

In late February, about 175 executives worldwide come to a
biotechnology company where Biogen's leadership conference is in Boston.
Over two days, the company members shook their hands and talked among
themselves and then shared meals. Several members at the event were

unknown infected with the microbe that causes COVID-19, and it quickly
spread among others there, who then brought it home. There are at least 99
people who ended up sick in Massachusetts alone (Aschwanden, 2020). The
outbreak put a lot of pressure on clinical resources and care. Source of
infection, including the patients, asymptomatic carrier, and patients in the
incubation period, are contagious. It is difficult to control the source of infection

(Yang, 2020).

The World Health Organization (WHO) said that the virus could spread
through direct contact within an infected person (generated through coughing
and sneezing). Individuals could also get infected from, and touch surfaces
contaminated with the virus and touch their face (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth). The
government can use many rapid diagnostic and serological tests for the
detection of suspected COVID-19 cases. However, such newly marketed tests'
sensitivity and specificity have not been evaluated and never up to standard
yet (Ahmad Naeem Sajed, Kapil Again, 2020). In the meantime, Strictly
recommended to observe the hygienic principles and to wash hands, and then
use the appropriate proper sanitation to avoid and spread the coronavirus. To
those living in a corona patient's home quarantine, the use of simple remedies
seems to be effective (Majid Rezaei Basiri, 2020). The Inter-Agency Task
Force of the Philippines established guidelines on implementing community
quarantine in the Philippines namely the General Community Quarantine,
which can be refers to the implementation of the temporary measures to avoid
virus, limiting movement and transportation, regulation of operating industries,

and presence of uniformed personnel to enforce community quarantine
protocols; The enhanced Community Quarantine - is refers to the
implementation of temporary measures imposing strict limitations in
movements and transportation of the people, an strict regulation of operating
industries are implemented , provision of food and essential services, and
heightened presence of uniformed personnel to enforce community quarantine
protocols; The Modified Enhanced Community Quarantine - are referred to the
transition between ECQ and GCQ, when the following measurement are
comply and become less necessary: stick limits on the movements and
transportation of the people, an strict regulation of operating industries are
implemented, provision of food and essential services, heightened presence of
uniformed personnel to enforce community quarantine protocols. Modified
General Community Quarantine ( MGCQ ) is the transition phase between
GCQ and the New Normal. The following temporary measures are relaxed and
become less necessary, limiting movement and transportation and the

presence of uniformed personnel to enforce community quarantine protocols.

The proponent develops InfectEd: an android mobile game to educate

","1.1 Rationale of the Study

In the present day, A lot of people dreamed of a machine which could
read characters and numerals, but it seems the first OCR (Optical Character
Recognition) device was developed in the late 1920s by the Austrian engineer
Gustav Tauschek (1899-1945), who in 1929 obtained a patent on OCR (so-
called Reading Machine) in Germany, followed by Paul Handel who obtained
a US patent on OCR (so-called Statistical Machine) in the USA in 1933 (U.S.
Patent 1915993). In 1935 Tauschek was granted a US patent on his machine
(U.S. Patent 2026329). Tauschek was a genius self-taught Viennese
engineer, with more than 200 patents in the computing field to his credit, who
used to work for IBM and who besides the first OCR device, invented also
many devices and systems for the punch-card machinery, as well as the
magnetic drum-memory. The Reading Machine of Tauschek was a
mechanical device, using template matching with a photodetector
(photoelectric cell, marked with 5 on the patent drawing). A picture containing
a text passed in front of the reading machine's window (marked with 1). The
comparison device was a disk (or a wheel, marked with 6) (which had holes in
the form of letters) rotating from the interior side of the objective lens (3). When
images and letter-shaped holes coincided in form, the click work rotated the

printing drum to the required letter, and this letter is printed on paper.

OCR traces its roots back to telegraphy. On the eve of the First World

War, physicist Emanuel Goldberg invented the machine that could read
characters and convert them into telegraph code. In the 1920s, he went a step
further and created the first electronic document retrieval system. At this time,
businesses were microfilming financial records — great in principle, but quickly
retrieving specific records from spools of the film was nigh on impossible. To
overcome this, Goldberg used a photoelectric cell to do pattern recognition
with the help of a movie projector. By repurposing existing technologies, he
took the first steps towards the automation of record keeping. The US patent
for his “Statistical Machine” was later acquired by IBM. Since then, OCR
technology has proliferated, with businesses all over the world relying on it to
help reduce overheads when it comes to converting and extracting data from

paper documents.

Therefore, we have decided to develop a web-based system that may
be of service of assisting the researcher or a user in which text images are
converted into machine-encoded text to provide Digitizing text means it can

be easily presented, edited, stored, and searched.

","1.1 Rationale of the Study
Bus is a means of transportation for short or long distance travelled.

Public busses are most common transportation for mass commuters.
According to Tavilla (Tavilla, 2015) Many commuters travel daily on multiple
modes of mass transit operated by different agencies with separate fare
collection systems that enables fare payments and trip planning across
regional transit systems and transportation. Therefore, bus is very important
for any commuters. Today, the means of payment specially on travelling are
in cash. According to Garcia et.al.,(Garcia, 2006) Monetary bills have been
launched into trade markets, and became one of the modes of payment up
to present. This means that it signifies the importance of cash especially
when you are on travel, riding buses or any kind of public vehicle.

According to John Belda (John Belda et al., 2015) Public utility
buses in the Philippines used one methods of payment process. The manual
payment method, in which the conductor uses puncher to release tickets for
the passenger. The significance of cash payment on buses holds some
issues and problems. According to Crisobal et.al., (Cristobal, 2018). Public
utility buses are the most commonly used vehicle in a long distance journey
passing through provincial and national roads. Problems in bus transactions
are being encountered. Usually, the passengers do not have exact amount
in paying bus fares and the conductors"" method of collection is time-

consuming. As money has been invented, fraud and volume payment
became an issue. It is also supported by the statement of John Belda, M. M
et.al.,(John Belda et al., 2015) Commonly mass of people used public
vehicle for it can travel in a much longer distance than any other

transportation vehicles using money that serves as payment.

Aside of money issues, giving money change is time-consuming.

Some bus operators tend to calculate the amount of fare with the given
kilometer and sometimes, inaccurate. Passengers have an exact amount of
money to pay for the bus fare and what they have to do is to wait for the
conductors change. According to Tirachini (Tirachini, 2013). Using the
estimated boarding and alighting average times, performance comparisons
are simulated assuming a service with payment outside buses validation
inside buses and cash transactions. In particular, that substantial time
savings are accruable if payment methods are upgraded from slow
techniques, such as cash transactions to the fastest while intermediate

technologies such as prepaid cards validated inside buses fall in between.
Therefore, the researchers come up with the idea of enhancing the
methods of paying fares in the bus by using an Android device and an
electronic QR code reading device which will be used by the conductors to
accumulate the passenger's fares. This payment method will be used both
the QR code reading device and Android technology. According to Crisobal
et.al., (Cristobal, 2018) Cashless transaction is one where the payment is
made by means other than physical cash. (Gupta, 2017) The rise of cashless
transaction is due to emerging trends driven by consumer's preference,
convenience and efficiency in transacting. (Ahmed, 2016) The concept of

cashless transaction system emerged in the nineteenth century.

","1.1 Rationale of the Study

In most of healthcare industries, physical monitoring has been employed. The
front liners needs to physically observe the condition of the patient, this
activity is time consuming and. it lacks of social distancing and everyday
preventive actions. In June 20, 2020 the Department of Health (DOH) 13
(Caraga) has confirmed local transmission of the coronavirus disease 2019
(Covid-19) after reporting 16 new infections in Butuan City, the 16 new
infections raise Butuan City’s total number of confirmed Covid-19-positive
cases to 27. Due to these developments, Director Jose R. Llacuna Jr. called
on local government units (LGUs) to strictly implement the health protocols to
contain the spread of Covid-19. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases
admitted in hospitals is continuously increasing in the Philippines. Front liners
health care workers are faced with imminent risks of being infected. In terms
of monitoring the patient Robots have replaced humans in performing
repetitive and dangerous tasks which humans prefer not to do, or are unable
to do because of the risks, the problem also related to the requirement of

manpower to perform physical activities and need to be minimized, the

proponents also developed a monitoring system.

"AUTOMATED AQUASCAPE TANK USING RASPBERRY PI (IOT)
","Automated Aqua Scape Tank (IOT) using Raspberry Pi has been
developed to give an aid specifically for the people who have pet shops and
handle large amounts of different animals to minimize their tasks and to
individuals who love to keep a fish but do not have enough time. This study
focuses only on the water level detection, water toxicity detection, and
automatic feeding of fishes. Furthermore, notification systems (via SMS) were
also included in the study to be more interactive wherein the pet owner will
receive a message whenever the water level in the fish tank decreases and
also will receive a message whenever the fish food container is empty. It is for
the owner to be notified. The Raspberry Pi has been chosen to be used as a
microcontroller in gathering information from the water level sensor and pH
sensor and mechanically control the aqua scape tank. The proponent
conducted a survey for the software quality of the system to the pet shop
owners and other individuals who are petting a fish in a tank. The software was
indeed functional because it helps them to feed and care for the fishes inside

the tank in the owner's absence. This study also eradicates the manual way of
changing the water whenever it becomes dirty and deadly for the fishes.

Keywords: Aqua Scape Tank, Water Level Detection, Water Level Sensor,
pH Sensor, Water Toxicity Detection
","1.1 Rationale of the Study

These days, people have adapted technological modemizations in
caring and interacting with animal pets at their homes. The duty and
responsibility of the one who feels fond of a pet make it strenuous to manage
their time. With the contemporary technologies in these times, people have
worked to take care of their pets automatically. Fishes are common animals to
be pet and used as hobbies or decorations at home and offices. It requires
enough food and adequate shelter for petting a fish. Its place must clean to
make it healthier and live a bit longer. A tank with a given volume is where the
fish will grow in a specific maximum size (Moore et al., 1977). The size of the
tank depends on the quantity and dimensions of the fishes that place in it. The
bigger the fish will get or the more fish to be identified, the larger and the bigger

the tank will need.

The tank's water is renewed by freshwater being introduced tangentially
at a point along the tank's periphery and circulating slowly towards a centrally
Situated outlet (Pullola et al., 1987). The tank is required to have enough water
in buckets to fill it up. Doing it handiwork is a difficult task itself. Moreover,
whenever the fish needs to be fed, manual feeding must be done to pick and

drop exact amounts of fish food in the tank and be observed personally.

The development of the Internet of Things (loT) points to a change in
data gathering. A cumulative amount of data composed today is generated by

sensors (Jyoti et al., 2016). The data gathered from the sensors will be collected
by the microcontrollers that perform a huge role in developing the project.
Raspberry Pi belongs to the most widely used microcontrollers (Martinez,
2016). The Raspberry Pi has been chosen as a microcontroller to gather

information from the pH sensor module, water level sensor module and

automatically control the feeder inside the tank.

Therefore, the proponents developed an Automated Aqua Scape Tank
using Raspberry Pi (loT) to aid people who have a pet shop and handle many
different animals. To minimize their tasks and for other individuals who love to
keep a fish at their office or home but do not have enough time to take good

care of it, especially while they are away from their home.

","1.1 Rationale of the Study

At present time, individuals have adjusted in modernization increases in
doing their errands. The day by day substantial outstanding task at hand and
schedules make it hard for individuals to deal with their time. With existing and
advancing innovations these days, from machines to apparatuses and cell
phones, individuals have turned to lead everyday tasks intelligently and

electronically.

The Internet of Things (loT) has been in the spotlight for the past decade. It
is regarded as one of the disruptive technologies of this century and so far, has
caught the attention of society, industry and academy as a way of
technologically enhancing day to day activities, the creation of new business
models, products and services, and as a broad source of research topics and
ideas. Several alliances, institutions, enterprises and even governments have
understood its importance and identified the potential benefits that can be
obtained from the loT, leading them to undertake strategic projects and

initiatives aiming to develop this field and profit from it (Alkhatib, 2017)

In agricultural matters, having a pig farm business arises many problem.
The manual feeding of pigs was not an easy task to do. To make it easier to the
person having pig farms, pig monitoring and automated feeding must be

utilized. A pig monitoring and automated feeding consist of a hardware that
monitors the pig and automatically refill the feeding place. It also have a mobile

application in order to notify the user.

Therefore, the researcher decided to develop An Automated Pig Feeding
with Depth Analysis using Computer Vision to solve the problem. It has a
prototype that mechanically feed the pigs in the set time and refills the water
automatically along with the computer vision, it is a module that provides the

parameter of the study.

"A WEB PORTAL APPLICATION FOR ACCESSING MICRO CREDIT
RECORDS
","A Web Portal Application for Accessing Micro Credit Records has been
developed to help lenders to view borrowers credit records especially their
previous credit from other lending company or institution. And to have
decision making for basis through credit scores as a measure of a persons
creditworthiness to identify if the borrowers are good payer or not. This study
focuses on lending company and other institution so they can easily view their
borrowers credit records with the credit score. The proponents used the
method of FICO (Fair Isaac Corporation) Credit scoring model as basis in
obtaining the credit score of the borrowers. The proponents conducted a
survey to test the developed system efficiency to the lenders as respondents
and was acceptable based on the obtained 4.07 mean average. With that, the
proponent developed a system for lenders to view their borrowers previous
credit records from other company and make decision through credit score of

the borrowers.

Keywords: Access, Credit Score, View Borrowers, Portal, Credit Record
","1.1 Rationale of the study

Credit is a very important product in banking and financial institutions.
There is always a customer in need of a loan. Since Loans are always
accompanied by risks, it is important to identify suitable applicants, and there
have to be a means to determine and separate the good applicants frorn the
bad. To solve this issue, financial institutions such as banks started
developing credit scores. Using the customer's credit scores lenders can
define the risk of loan applicants. By calculating the credit score, lenders can
make a decision as to who gets credit, would the person be able to pay off the
loan and what percentage of credit or loan they can get (Lyn C. Thomas,

David B. Edelman and Jonathan N. Crook 2002).

Credit Reporting is one of the most important institutions in modern
financial system how credit reporting works in the financial system around the
world, to provide empirical evidence of the value of credit reporting data for
credit analysis, and to identify appropriate public policy recommendation.
Credit records such as a previous loan of a person performance tool to predict
his or her future behavior. And also, Credit scoring is used by the lenders from
different company and institution to help decide on whether to extend or deny
credit of their borrowers. One of the most important kits, to classify a bank
customers, as a part of the credit evaluation process to reduce the current
and the expected risk of a customer being bad credit, is credit scoring. (Hand

& Jacka, 1998, p. 106)
According to Janice Jardio an employee of Macondray Finance
Corporation one of the small lending company in Butuan city to have an
access of the borrowers credit information they do background checking of
the client personal information. By that, the lending company have the basis if
they can assure to lend money to clients. They said that in terms of sharing
information to other lending company they cannot easily give the information
of the clients if the other lending company wants to know the information of
the borrower. In addition, the lending company can share information but
limited only because of competition and for the sake of the clients data
privacy. According also to one of the employee of QCredit Corporation that
the data are centralized, the information was shared only to the different
branches of QCredit Corporation. Moreover, on getting information about the
borrowers, the lending company needs more background information
checking or so-called customer intelligence (Cl) to determine if the borrowers
of the lending company can manage the loan payments.

The use of credit records and related decision tools, such as credit
scoring can also facilitate the supervision of financial institutions by providing
standard and objective criteria for credit analysis.

Therefore, the proponents decided to develop A Web Portal Application
for Accessing Micro Credit Records to help the lending company to have
access to the borrowers previous credit records with the credit scores. Also
with this study, the lenders may obtain borrowers credit records to know how
borrowers manage financial responsibilities and to help lenders decide
whether to lend the borrowers or not. Also, to know the other lending
companies where the borrowers have a previous credit, with the credit score

the lenders can evaluate the borrowers creditworthiness to make lending

decision.

"MONITORING BABY’S BEHAVIOR AND ENVIRONMENT
TEMPERATURE WITH SMS NOTIFICATION ALARM FEATURES USING
RASPBERRY PI
","ABSTRACT

This study is about Monitoring Baby's Behavior, and Environment Temperature
with SMS Notification Alarm Features using Raspberry Pi. The study was conducted
to provide a solution to the parents’ problem that leads to incidents of their babies,
especially those 6 months to a |-year-old baby that needs supervision every time it
sleeps alone in the crib. The prototype will monitor the behavior of the baby's motion
and the temperature of the room's environment. If the baby's behavior is active, that
was set on the prototype. If the temperature is already high, it will notify the parents.
The Buzzer will trigger to inform the status of their baby's on the crib either it 1s
already awake standing or holding on the crib or the temperature is already hot.
Evaluated the newly developed system as functional, reliable, efficient, and usable.
Using the Waterfall Development Model Methodology, the prototype was developed
and implemented into a hardware output that would benefit different establishments
and their parent. The prototype used Raspberry Pi 3, Ultrasonic Sensor, Digital
Temperature Sensor DS18B20, and Piezo Buzzer. In addition, the prototype receives
notification via the GSM Module. The study had reached its purpose and primary
objectives. The researchers concluded that the developed system was accepted by the

ISO/IEC Software Quality Test.

Keywords: Monitoring, Detection, Temperature, Notifications, Raspberry Pi
","1.1 Rationale of the Study
Monitoring is usual storage that detects something people use to record their
daily activities. It will help the parents monitor and be with their baby every minute
of every day. Parenting is not an easy task, and responsibilities seem to change from
day to day. However, one task is always important, monitoring your baby by
notifying you. Research says that monitoring your baby's behavior is a crucial way to
lower its chances to prevent incidents, especially those that can be harmful, like the
environmental temperature SCANVA, 2021. Parents still have to don their household
chores, etc., but either finish a task or comfort the baby. Other times may be that the
parents are outside gardening or showering. However, how parents look after their
children has changed with technological breakthroughs. They are now thinking about
adopting technological and engineering inventions for advantages and benefits in
terms of the safety issues of their babies IRJET, 2019. According to SCANVA, 2021
that monitoring means establishing firm guidelines and limits for your baby to keep
notified of what is going on with its behavior.

According to the study of Broken Homes and Battered Children, 1993,
conducted by Robert Whelan, the mother's boyfriend appears to be a particularly
potent source of danger to the child. When a young child is alone with his mother's
friend, he is at increased risk of being left behind. According to SSA, 2021, the

temperature can make your baby cry. They may call because they are too hot or too

cold.
According to STANFORD CHILDREN'S HEALTH, 2021, Babies cannot
regulate their body temperature, and toddlers are also more sensitive to temperature.
One of the most common dilemmas facing parents these days is how to monitor their
baby while taking care of other things.

Maybe it's to do chores, work, go on a bathroom break, or get a quick
breather while the baby sleeps. But as many new mommies and daddies find out, this
is next to impossible. You can't keep an eye on your precious little one 24/7.

Since these accidents can be preventable that we are already in an innovative
generation, the proponents decided to propose a study that the baby can be monitored
by high-end innovative technology entitled, Monitoring Baby's Behavior and
Environment Temperature with SMS Notification Alarm Features using Raspberry Pi

to provide a solution to the problem that leads to frequent crib cause of incidents to
infant babies. A prototype will monitor and detect the baby's motion and check the
environment's temperature. Once the action is already met, the active motion and the
temperature of the room is already high, and it will turn on the Buzzer and send an
SMS Notification to the parent to notify them that the baby is already awake standing

or holding on the crib from sleep and the temperature of the room is already high or

hot.

"FIRE ALARM SYSTEM
","ABSTRACT

The Fire Alarm System has been developed to provide an optimal solution for
fire spreading. This study focuses only on helping people avoid fire spreading, leading
to minor and significant injuries, and worse is death. Using the System Development
Life Cycle (SDLC) to develop the prototype enhances the development to make the
evaluation of each module easier — it also acts as a guide for the proponents. The
proponents used an offline system named Fire Alarm System in the prototype in sending
the predefined messages that include information of the household such as Name of the
owner, address, and Fire Level. The following electronic components and technologies
were utilized in developing the House to Fire Station communication: Arduino Uno as
the microcontroller, LCD (16 x 2 12C), Piezo Speaker, Buttons, Breadboard, Jumper
Wires, GSM sim900a, MQ2 Gas Sensor and IR Flame Sensor. The proponents carefully
analyzed all the necessary data gathered from the internet. They surveyed to assess the
quality of the system — to fifty (50) respondents composed of forty-nine (49)
Households, one (1) Fire Marshal of BFP Butuan. The assessment accumulated 4.31
total mean, equivalent to highly acceptable. The device is indeed an ideal solution to
help the prevention of Fire Spreading — enabling the house to communicate and transmit
information towards the Fire Station.

KEYWORD: House to Fire Station, Fire Alarm System, Hardware, Arduino,
Predefined Messages, Location.
","1.1 The rationale of the study

In these modern times, fire protection and prevention have become one
of the top concerns of people around the globe, according to Trung Luong
(2019), because fire hazards are everywhere, especially indoors where home
appliances and more potential fire hazards like a left out burning candle are
present, that can cause a great deal of damage to human properties or even live
itself. Here in the Philippines, most of the commercial establishments have their
fire systems being installed except for residential buildings both in rural and
urban areas as of yet, according to Chris Schnabel (Rappler, 2016), most
residences 83% of them, have not invested in any fire/security system even
though most people spend most of their time at home with their family and these
areas are most commonly to have a fire outbreak that can quickly spread onto
the nearest households. Therefore, having a fire alarm system in domestic
homes, especially in their kitchens where fire can mostly occur, plays an
important role, which will help prevent and handle fire outbreaks in time the
moment it happens. According to IFSEC Philippines (2021), between 2013 and
2017, the BFP recorded 77,724 fire incidents, 15,545 fire incidents per year, or

42 fire incidents per day. During that time, total estimated property damage
totaled P23.273 billion, or P4.65 billion per year on average. One thousand two
hundred fifty-seven people were killed during the same period, averaging 251
deaths per year. During the five years, 4,239 people were injured, with an
average of 848 people suffering from fire-related injuries that could have been

avoided. Electrical connections, lighted cigarette butts, and open flame are the

top three causes of fires, according to the BFP.

The Bureau of Fire Protection responded to 16,408 fire incidents
nationwide from January to October 2019, a 14.23 percent increase over the
14,364 recorded during the same period in 2018. Of the total fire incidents in
2019, 7,865 were structural, 7,660 were nonstructural, and 883 were vehicular
fires. Most people aren't that experienced in handling their wirings at home, and
then they refuse to get a professional to take it for them. This kind of scenario
is almost impossible to manage among the masses. Fire detection and alarm
systems (FDAS) are all structured and introduced with the same fundamental
target: to discover a fire; effective alarm and provide information to the
inhabitants; warn and give information to first responders. How these objectives

are satisfied depends on the particular situations and the standard of the area of

the world under consideration.

Having a fire alarm system is one of the primary systems required to be
implemented and installed in every household or establishment in most

countries. The systems that are installed helps alert people of a possible fire
outbreak, give them early warnings; can automatically call the emergency
services and contacts, minimize the time it takes for the fire department to
respond; lower the risks of a false fire alarm; in the event of a fault, it can tell
the exact problem, it also can have reduced fire damage to property according
to Trung Luong (2019). The first fire alarm system ever was invented way back
in 1852 by Dr. William F. Channing and Moses Farmer. The system consisted
of two fire alarm boxes with a telegraphic key and a handle. If a fire were
detected in a home or business, someone would have to reach inside one of the
boxes and crank the handle to send an alert about the fire to a nearby alarm
station. An operator at the station would then take the message and alert a fire
department about it to send help (Life Safety Consultants, 2021). The first
electric fire alarm system was invented almost four decades later in 1890 by
Francis Robbins Upton. He recognized that, in most cases, people wouldn't have
time to stand around and crank a handle inside of a box when a fire started.
Therefore, his electric system eliminated the need for this step. Surprisingly, the
design for his plan wasn't all that popular when it was first introduced, but over
time, people started to realize the need for a more advanced fire alarm system
like this one. Also, based on the online survey conducted by the proponents with
fifty respondents -- tenants in Butuan City's residential zones, 84% responded

that having a fire alarm system is vital and only 16% disagree.

Since these incidents can be prevented early on, the proponents came up

with the idea of developing a fire alarm system suited for residential buildings
capable of sending an SMS and Location of where the incident is happening
with the use of SIM900A GSM Core Module. A device that will alert the people

within the household and the BFP without the need for human interaction the

moment a fire occurs.

"IoT Smart Trash Bin With Level Notifier Using Arduino
","ABSTRACT

One of the major problems that the world is facing today is waste management.
Most of the time it is seen that the waste is been spilled over the bins and lying nearby.
This leads to the spreading of some deadly diseases in the surrounding environment.
Also, people find it difficult to walk beside it. All these problems, due to a lack of
coordination and communication among the garbage team members. Also, the study
has revealed that waste management can be far more efficient if the garbage is
segregated at the source and then disposed of in dumping grounds separately. Thus,
there is a big need to have proper waste management. Considering the above issues,
this paper proposes a prototype that will try to reduce these problems to a greater extent.
This system initially segregates the waste and then monitors the garbage level in bins
using IloT. This data related to the bin level is sent directly to the utility worker, where
the prototype processes the real-time data and raises alerts to manage the collection of
waste. The proposed prototype also takes care of the long time goal of identifying the
pattern of waste generation at various localities. This data collected by this prototype
can be used to further plan effective measures to reduce waste mismanagement and
maintain a cleaner environment.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Rationale of the Study

In the age of advanced technology and electronics, the lifestyle of humans
should be smart, simpler, easier, and much more convenient. Therefore, there is a
need for many automated systems in human's daily routines. The scenario of waste
sorting or segregating of garbage is degrading tremendously. In the cities, the
immense population growth creates an unhygienic environment for the citizen of the
society, especially in public places where we can see garbage bins or trash cans
placed but unsegregated. This rapid growth of waste leads to various infectious
diseases in the environment, especially during this time of pandemic where people
can be possibly infected with different viruses from the garbage bins by holding or

touching the bin's lid to throw their trash.

"Web-Based Evaluation Examination with Strand Recommendation for
Incoming Senior High School Students
","ABSTRACT

An evaluation examination is one of the requirements of the student for their
senior high school life. Before entering their selected school, students must take an
admission exam and, if necessary, a school evaluation. Exam papers are typically used
for admission exams. Traditional methods take time. The system will prepare test
questionnaires, which is too much paperwork and may be problematic during the
epidemic. Manual exams are inefficient and inconvenient. Pandemic days make it
unsafe to go outside; thus, students can take the admissions exam on their devices inside
or outside the school. The team has interview data. Exams will be multiple-choice.
Exams should be subject-specific. The Guidance Counselor will be in charge of the
student's participation in the exam, while the Psychometrician will be in charge of the
system; however, not all schools have a Psychometrician. The interviewee also
suggested a mixed-strand seminar on how the Web-based Evaluation Exam with Strand
Recommendation will guide them. Upon additional investigation, the team will employ
Standard Nine (Stanine) in computing exam results, a scaling mechanism suited for
turning scores into student skills and appropriate with the system's decision assistance
to recommend the strand.

NNVS does not have an existing system or web-based software that is easy to
use and a strand suggestion system. ACLC only uses a computerized test system that
lacks a strand recommendation system to help students choose their best suitable strand.
The study aims to build a school-wide Strand Recommendation system for high school
students. Proponents gathered user and system needs data to build this project. Data
was used to determine project goals. The proposed system recommends strands using a
stanine approach. The strand recommendations serve both the school and the students
by suggesting beneficial and acceptable strands for each student and making the
guidance staff's job easier. Proponents say the system is a massive help to high school
seniors. Use a strand-suggesting algorithm. After 1900, technology dominated our
lives. This paperless and entirely automated approach is advised for transforming the

exam into a high-quality strand recommendation system.

Keywords: Online Examination, Web-based, Evaluation, Strand Recommendation
","1.1 Rationale of the study

The evaluation exam is considered a standard practice in various countries
worldwide, requiring students to take it before university (UniAssist, 2020). It is
mandatory for every person who wants to pursue their career (Jennifer, 2016).
Students from different universities, including elementary, high school, and
college, take an evaluation exam to test their capacity and skills before enrolling.

Its primary purpose is to judge a student's ability, sharpness, and knowledge
(Foundertalks, 2020).

The Department of Education in the Philippines introduced the k-12 curriculum
into the education system the Philippines (Wimsquad, 2018). It taught senior high
school, adding two more years of learning. Each student can choose a couple of
tracks before entering senior high school. These tracks are Academic, Technical-
Vocational-Livelihood, Sports, and Arts. The academic track includes three
strands, which are: Accounting, Business, and Management (ABM); Humanities
and Social Sciences (HUMSS); and Science, Technology, Engineering, and
Mathematics (STEM) (Gazette, 2020). Senior high school students must choose an
academic track they want to pursue. Choosing the right strand can lead to a better

pathway to college, which aligns with students' passion; it is vital (Santos et al.,

2019).
It is a common problem that Senior High School students may regret their
chosen tracks. Their decisions are affected by peers, family influences, and self-
choice (Moneva, 2019). However, they could continue going to college without
aligning their track using the bridging program, but of course, it will take time and

money (Philippinesbasiceducation, 2018).
Despite offering a bridging program for students not aligning their track and

college degree to pursue, students still find it hard to continue college (Elsom,

Greenaway, Marshman, 2017). Only 45% of high school students feel confident
about college (EWA, 2020).

As a result, the researchers devised the concept of designing and developing a
web-based assisted evaluation examination for the upcoming senior high school
students and a list of strand recommendations and schools offering that strand.
Furthermore, to help those students who cannot or have difficulties deciding what
strand to choose in their senior high school life. In addition, it supports schools in

delivering accurate and faster checking than traditional manual checking of test

paper examinations.

In this day, age of Information and Communication Technology (ICT)
computerized booking is expected to provide more convenience to consumers because

they will be able to book at any time, and people may work from any location as long

as they have access to the internet (Mazlan, 2018).

Rental housing is a growing and profitable investment sector that has attracted
many investors from developed and developing nations worldwide. Housing is one of
life's most fundamental needs. It is imperative for economic, social, cultural, and

personal well-being. International human rights legislation recognizes the right to

decent housing. (Nations, 2014).

According to the National Urban Rental Housing Policy (Draft) 2015, issued by
the housing ministry and urban poverty alleviation, rental housing refers to the owner's
property. The tenant pays periodic mutually agreed rent to the owner. As the number of
tenants tends to increase, the management of the rental houses tends to be complicated.

Most of them are paper-based. Some tenants can use this weakness to evade paying the

rent, losing the landlords.

To break out the problem, researchers developed an Android-based named
House Rental System, which aims to solve the common problem of all tenants,
landlords, owners and make the easiest way of locating rent houses. In the past few

years, some researchers were proposed a ""HAYBOL: An Android-Based Apartment
Locator Application (2017)” to provide the needs of the tenants. Unfortunately, specific
solution scenarios were insufficient to meet the needs of all consumers. It is because
not all renters can afford personal computers. Some renters in remote locations were
unable to quickly rent a Personal Computer (PC) or locate a computer store to browse
online to access the site of the aforementioned web-based system. To assist in resolving
the issue, proponents offer a mobile app called ""House Rental Management System.”
It is a mobile-based program that will make it more comfortable for renters, particularly
those who do not have personal computers and rely solely on smartphones and Android
phones. Using the internet, users may quickly download and install the program from
the Google Play store.

As a result, the goal of our initiative is to assist owners/landlords manage their
rental housing firm digitally and without hassle and give access to low-income families,
employees, students, and others. To conveniently locate houses-to-let using technology
rather than physically searching for available rental houses or contacting brokers to
assist them with the process of locating rental residences, which may entail additional
costs. This system will assist landlords in advertising and promoting their house rental

"AD-HOC BASED VEHICLE TRACKING SYSTEM
","ABSTRACT

Car-napping remained most prevalent. Car manufacturers continuously work hard to

improve the security features of their products. This is the primary reason why most

car owners nowadays decide to invest in third-party anti-theft devices to protect their

vehicles. Unfortunately, carnappers are keeping up. Motor vehicles are the primary

mode of transportation for most of us and are often an indispensable part of our lives.

Car-related thefts are among the most common offenses calling for a police response.

The lack of information regarding the location of the stolen vehicle and the slow
initial investigation time made the process of finding the vehicle difficult. The vehicle
tracking system is a complete fleet management and security solution. The proponents
came up with the idea of developing an Ad-hoc based Vehicle Tracking System. This
device will enable the users to detect the stolen vehicle at the moment the ad-hoc
tracking device pairs up. The device will send the time of detection via message to the
other device, which will be displayed on the LCD monitor of the receiving device.

KEYWORD: Ad-hoc Network, Hardware, Vehicle Tracking System, LCD, Python.
","1.1 Rationale of the Study

The vehicle tracking system is a complete fleet management and security solution.
It is the technology that determines a vehicle’s location using various methods such as
GPS and other navigation systems that operate via satellite and ground-based stations.
Modern vehicle tracking systems use GPS technology to track and find our vehicles
anywhere on the planet, but other types of automatic vehicle location technology are
sometimes used as well. The vehicle tracking system is installed inside the vehicle
and provides accurate real-time location information. The data can also be saved and
downloaded to a computer for later analysis. This System is a must-have for tracking
a car whenever the owner wishes to keep an cye on it, and it is becoming incredibly
popular among those who own expensive cars for theft prevention and recovery. The
information gathered can be viewed on electronic maps using software and the
Internet (Techtarget, 2019). A vehicle tracking system combines the installation of an
electronic device in a vehicle with custom software that allows the owner to watch the
vehicle while gathering data from the field and delivering it to the base of operations.
Public transit in cities. The device is equipped with modern hardware and software
that allows it to track and locate vehicles both online and offline. A tracking system
comprises three major components: a vehicle unit, a fixed-based station, and a

database with software (N. Hlaing et al., 2019).
In the world of transportation, it benefits from knowing the advantages of the
emerging GPS and tracking technology (Teletrac Navman, 2021.) There are many
different reasons to purchase tracking systems for a fleet of vehicles. Being able to
map out the locations of your fleet means that you will always know who is closest to
that vital job. The tracking system will allow any stolen vehicle to be tracked around
the country and therefore ensure that it is returned in the quickest amount of time.
Many businesses rely ona speedy response to ensure that their customers are happy
with the service that they receive. Customer service is the one aspect that a business
can still stand out in and having a tracking device will ensure that vehicles can be
monitored and stationed in the correct places to respond to any customer requests
(Post Tracking America, 2020).

Car manufacturers continuously work hard to improve the security features of
their products. Unfortunately, carnappers are keeping up. This is the primary reason
why most car owners nowadays decide to invest in third-party anti-theft devices to
protect their vehicles. Carnapping remained most prevalent in Metro Manila with the
National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) having eight cases, followed by
Central Visayas Police Regional Office (PRO-7) with four cases; Central Luzon
(PRO-3) with three cases; Northern Mindanao (PRO-10) with two cases; and
Cordillera (PRO-COR) and Soccsksargen (PRO-12) with one case cach. Philippines
private car theft rate was at a level of 4.6 cases per 100,000 population in 2018, from
6.2 cases per 100,000 population previous year, this is a change of 25.81%. (PNP

highway patrol group, 2019). Vehicle Security is a primary concern for all vehicle

Owners. Owners as well as researchers are always looking for new and upgraded
vehicle security systems. Motor vehicles are the primary mode of transportation for

most of us, and often an indispensable part of our lives. Car-related thefts are among

the most common offenses calling for a police response. The lack of information
regarding the location of the stolen vehicle and the slow initial investigation time
made the process of finding the vehicle difficult. To assist the search process, an

additional device is needed on the vehicle as a location information provider (P.K.

Sanda et. Al, 2020).

The proponents came up with the idea of developing an Ad-hoc based Vehicle
Tracking System. This device will be able to detect if that certain car is stolen by the

use of Ad-Hoc Network and send real time location of the vehicle car owner thru text

"Web-Based Calamity Assistance Locator
","ABSTRACT

The Web-based Calamity Assistance Locator is a web-based system that can
help people during calamities like earthquakes and flooding. The system can be
accessed through a smartphone connected to the internet. The user/evacuees are
required to fill in the required information and then choose the barangay where they
are registered. After registering, the user must log in and select the type of calamity,
such as a flood or an earthquake. A list of suggested areas will be shown. The
advantage of the system is that, it recognizes the health condition (e.g. with health
condition, pregnant or PWD (Person with Disability)) of the users, which allows them
to find an evacuation facility that is suitable for them, and to have a standard capacity
in every evacuation facility. Upon reservation, the user can click the button to view
the larger map, which directs the mobile device to the GPS and shows the route to the
assigned location. The minimum requirement of the mobile phone for the system is at
least 2GB of RAM and must have an operating system (OS) version of Marshmallow
v.6.0 API level 23 or any higher version in order to have smooth and efficient

performance when you use it.

KEYWORD: Web-Based Calamity Locator, Calamities, Evacuation Facility, GPS
","1.1 Rationale of the Study

The City of Butuan is one of the areas in the Philippines that always and
frequently experience flooding when heavy and extreme rainfall scenarios occur in
the area. It is located at the Agusan Valley, Mindanao, sprawling across. It is bounded
to the north, west, and south by Agusan del Norte, the cast by Agusan del Sur, and the
northwest by Butuan Bay. (Joy C. Casinginan, 2017) . The city's geographic location
suggests rigorous preparation for the unexpected hazards that will probably strike.
Records of typhoons that have struck Butuan City are noted, especially Tropical
Depression Agaton and Seniang. Accessibility to transportation during the flood event
is difficult. Because this natural phenomenon can result in significant loss of lives and
properties, preparation is best applied before this Calamity occurs. Most government
agencies, especially the Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DRRM) Offices,
initiate various programs to improve their services to their respective locale. Since
technology is now on the verge of making human life more manageable and

performing digital processes and automation, the use of technologies to change and

enhance the systems and protocols of the CGB is deemed necessary. (Alexander T.

Demetillo, 2016)
According to Queenie Lozada and Gino Abatayo, residents of Baan River
Side, most of them are unaware of the location and availability of Evacuation
Facilities suitable for the evacuees' families' health situation. According to their
experience, being an evacuee is difficult, especially when the evacuation center is
overcrowded. Crystal Palado, one of the residents of Barangay Mahogany, also stated
that most of them are aware of the common evacuation center on their barangay.
However, they are unsure if that particular evacuation is safe, still available, and
appropriate for their family's health situation. Based on their experience during
Calamity, the evacuees fully occupied the evacuation center. The elderly and sick

individuals share the same room. Individuals are just putting up tents in the corners to

provide shelter during others.

The proponents decided to develop a Web-Based Calamity Assistance Locator
system that uses GPS to help the residents and provide them the nearest Evacuation
Center in terms of Calamity. By providing them a suitable evacuation facility based
on the health status of their family. Our system will automatically give a location

closer to the user's present location by filling in all of the essential information from

the user.

"FIRE ALARM SYSTEM |
","ABSTRACT

The Fire Alarm System has been developed to provide an optimal solution for
fire spreading. This study focuses only on helping people avoid fire spreading, leading
to minor and significant injuries, and worse is death. Using the System Development
Life Cycle (SDLC) to develop the prototype enhances the development to make the
evaluation of each module easier — it also acts as a guide for the proponents. The
proponents used an offline system named Fire Alarm System in the prototype in sending
the predefined messages that include information of the household such as Name of the
owner, address, and Fire Level. The following electronic components and technologies
were utilized in developing the House to Fire Station communication: Arduino Uno as

the microcontroller, LCD (16 x 2 I2C), Piezo Speaker, Buttons, Breadboard, Jumper

Wires, GSM sim900a, MQ2 Gas Sensor and IR Flame Sensor. The proponents carefully
analyzed all the necessary data gathered from the internet. They surveyed to assess the

","1.1 The rationale of the study

In these modern times, fire protection and prevention have become one
of the top concerns of people around the globe, according to Trung Luong
(2019), because fire hazards are everywhere, especially indoors where home
appliances and more potential fire hazards like a left out burning candle are
present, that can cause a great deal of damage to human properties or even live
itself. Here in the Philippines, most of the commercial establishments have their
fire systems being installed except for residential buildings both in rural and
urban areas as of yet, according to Chris Schnabel (Rappler, 2016), most
residences 83% of them, have not invested in any fire/security system even
though most people spend most of their time at home with their family and these
areas are most commonly to have a fire outbreak that can quickly spread onto
the nearest households. Therefore, having a fire alarm system in domestic
homes, especially in their kitchens where fire can mostly occur, plays an
important role, which will help prevent and handle fire outbreaks in time the
moment it happens. According to IFSEC Philippines (2021), between 2013 and
2017, the BFP recorded 77,724 fire incidents, 15,545 fire incidents per year, or

42 fire incidents per day. During that time, total estimated property damage
totaled P23.273 billion, or P4.65 billion per year on average. One thousand two
hundred fifty-seven people were killed during the same period, averaging 251
deaths per year. During the five years, 4,239 people were injured, with an
average of 848 people suffering from fire-related injuries that could have been
avoided. Electrical connections, lighted cigarette butts, and open flame are the

top three causes of fires, according to the BFP.

The Bureau of Fire Protection responded to 16,408 fire incidents
nationwide from January to October 2019, a 14.23 percent increase over the
14,364 recorded during the same period in 2018. Of the total fire incidents in
2019, 7,865 were structural, 7,660 were nonstructural, and 883 were vehicular
fires. Most people aren't that experienced in handling their wirings at home, and
then they refuse to get a professional to take it for them. This kind of scenario
is almost impossible to manage among the masses. Fire detection and alarm
systems (FDAS) are all structured and introduced with the same fundamental
target: to discover a fire; effective alarm and provide information to the
inhabitants; warn and give information to first responders. How these objectives

are satisfied depends on the particular situations and the standard of the area of

the world under consideration.

Having a fire alarm system is one of the primary systems required to be
implemented and installed in every household or establishment in most

countries. The systems that are installed helps alert people of a possible fire
outbreak, give them early warnings; can automatically call the emergency
services and contacts, minimize the time it takes for the fire department to
respond; lower the risks of a false fire alarm; in the event of a fault, it can tell
the exact problem, it also can have reduced fire damage to property according
to Trung Luong (2019). The first fire alarm system ever was invented way back
in 1852 by Dr. William F. Channing and Moses Farmer. The system consisted
of two fire alarm boxes with a telegraphic key and a handle. If a fire were
detected in a home or business, someone would have to reach inside one of the
boxes and crank the handle to send an alert about the fire to a nearby alarm
station. An operator at the station would then take the message and alert a fire
department about it to send help (Life Safety Consultants, 2021). The first
electric fire alarm system was invented almost four decades later in 1890 by
Francis Robbins Upton. He recognized that, in most cases, people wouldn't have
time to stand around and crank a handle inside of a box when a fire started.
Therefore, his electric system eliminated the need for this step. Surprisingly, the
design for his plan wasn't all that popular when it was first introduced, but over
time, people started to realize the need for a more advanced fire alarm system
like this one. Also, based on the online survey conducted by the proponents with
fifty respondents -- tenants in Butuan City's residential zones, 84% responded
that having a fire alarm system is vital and only 16% disagree.

Since these incidents can be prevented early on, the proponents came up

with the idea of developing a fire alarm system suited for residential buildings
capable of sending an SMS and Location of where the incident is happening
with the use of SIM900A GSM Core Module. A device that will alert the people
within the household and the BFP without the need for human interaction the

moment a fire occurs.

","1.1 Introduction

In 2019, a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 has been rapidly
spreading and resulted in a respiratory illness known as COVID-19. The
epidemic has spread to over 210 countries, with over 2,400,000 confirmed
cases and over 170,000 deaths. COVID-19 causes severe pneumonia
characterized by fever, cough, and shortness of breath (Am Med, 2020).
According to WHO (World Health Organization), there are no specific
vaccines/treatments for COVID-19 patients. However, there are many process
Clinical trials evaluating the possibilities of treatments. Unfortunately, there is
no comprehensive summary of the multiorgan manifestations of COVID-19,
making it difficult for clinicians to educate themselves about this highly

contagious and deadly pathogen quickly.

In late February, about 175 executives worldwide come to a
biotechnology company where Biogen's leadership conference is in Boston.
Over two days, the company members shook their hands and talked among

themselves and then shared meals. Several members at the event were

unknown infected with the microbe that causes COVID-19, and it quickly
spread among others there, who then brought it home. There are at least 99
people who ended up sick in Massachusetts alone (Aschwanden, 2020). The
outbreak put a lot of pressure on clinical resources and care. Source of
infection, including the patients, asymptomatic carrier, and patients in the
incubation period, are contagious. It is difficult to control the source of infection

(Yang, 2020).

The World Health Organization (WHO) said that the virus could spread
through direct contact within an infected person (generated through coughing
and sneezing). Individuals could also get infected from, and touch surfaces
contaminated with the virus and touch their face (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth). The
government can use many rapid diagnostic and serological tests for the
detection of suspected COVID-19 cases. However, such newly marketed tests’
sensitivity and specificity have not been evaluated and never up to standard
yet (Ahmad Naeem Sajed, Kapil Again, 2020). In the meantime, Strictly
recommended to observe the hygienic principles and to wash hands, and then
use the appropriate proper sanitation to avoid and spread the coronavirus. To
those living in a corona patient's home quarantine, the use of simple remedies
seems to be effective (Majid Rezaei Basiri, 2020). The Inter-Agency Task
Force of the Philippines established guidelines on implementing community
quarantine in the Philippines namely the General Community Quarantine,
which can be refers to the implementation of the temporary measures to avoid
virus, limiting movement and transportation, regulation of operating industries,

and presence of uniformed personnel to enforce community quarantine
protocols; The enhanced Community Quarantine - is refers to the
implementation of temporary measures imposing strict limitations in
movements and transportation of the people, an strict regulation of operating
industries are implemented , provision of food and essential services, and
heightened presence of uniformed personnel to enforce community quarantine
protocols; The Modified Enhanced Community Quarantine - are referred to the
transition between ECQ and GCQ, when the following measurement are
comply and become less necessary: stick limits on the movements and
transportation of the people, an strict regulation of operating industries are
implemented, provision of food and essential services, heightened presence of
uniformed personnel to enforce community quarantine protocols. Modified
General Community Quarantine ( MGCQ ) is the transition phase between
GCQ and the New Normal. The following temporary measures are relaxed and
become less necessary, limiting movement and transportation and the

presence of uniformed personnel to enforce community quarantine protocols.

","1.1 Rationale of the Study

Viruses that can cause pandemics are not new in our world. Viruses we
already face before, such as the SARS-CoV pathogen, were responsible for
8,000 cases in 2013, and MERS-CoV pathogen was responsible for 2,494
points in the year 2012 (Li, X., Zai, J., Zhao, Q., Yi Li, Q.N., Foley, B.T., Chaillon,
A., 2020). Those viruses are contagious to indirect and direct transmission.
Once the virus contaminated the environment, the person must be careful
because when it touches a contaminated object, hands can then initiate self-
inoculation of mucous membranes of the nose, eyes, or mouth that is the
indirect transmission. Direct transmission happens when a person talks and

touches an infected person.

Some of the protocols and controls include the need for hand hygiene
and personal protective equipment and to minimize self-contamination to
reduce the spread. For protection against inoculation of mucosal surfaces in
the respiratory tract, enhanced surface cleaning and disinfection are common
control contributors (Otter, J.A., Donskey, C., Yezli, S., Douthwaite, S.,
Goldenberg, S.D., Weber, D.J., 2016). The syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-

CoV-2) is now tranche called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Nowadays, due to the coronavirus pandemic, people discover many
disinfection and sanitation products in the market, and some local Officials are
encouraging the public to use face masks and face shields when going to a

public place or riding a public utility vehicle. Businesses and establishments
were required to implement social distancing, hand sanitation, and check a
person's temperature before entering the building. However, when a person
goes back home from buying foods or items, the sanitation and disinfection of

items or products were neglected.

With this overlooked aspect, the proponents proposed a Micro-controller
Based System for Object Disinfection and Sanitation. It is a multitask
disinfection and sanitation machine that was able to identify objects like food,
non-food products. For development, the proponents maximize the use of

raspberry pi and Arduino Uno with OpenCV libraries in Python for image

","1.1 Project Context

Most of the time, people have money with them. Be it coins or bills,
each of us has it. Some people are into currency collecting, which means that
bills and coins are significant to them. According to Liberty Coin & Currency et
al.(2016), Collecting coins and notes may be the same. But there is a big
difference that is beyond the surface of what it seems. Paper Currencies are
much more convenient to store the coin currency because it occupies less
space and allows one to store more in their money storage. Due to the long
historical existence of coins, the world has a more significant number of them
at its disposal. Paper Currencies have higher face values, and this makes

them more expensive to purchase than coins.

Based on the differences stated, bills and coins each have their pros
and cons. However, in an article by Joanne E. Mcneish et al. (2020), she said
that people like paper bills. Most customers consider paper bills to have more
value, especially for those who do their transactions online; this could mean
that people prefer to have their money in the form of a paper bill. But Abigail
Abrams (et al. 2017) stated that paper money could harbor thousands of
microbes from every environment it touches. Hundreds of microorganisms
bills. And although plenty was harmless,

species were found living on paper

there are still some species that cause skin infections. Traces of drugs such
as cocaine were also found when they made another observation. A
microbiologist named Susan Whittier said that many people are not washing
their hands when they are ata restaurant, and money is going back and forth,
and you don't know who's touched it. Other research has shown that
Pathogens that cause serious illness like E. coli and salmonella are contained
in some bills and coins. This Study has cited some reasons that may cause

people not to want paper bills as their money.

Many studies try to prove the importance of either coins or bills, so these
forms of money still exist today and are still used by people. Based on the
Studies that the proponents have cited, cash are preferable to coins in storage
efficiency and monetary value. But sometimes, there are instances when we
have too many coins in our pockets that it causes us inconvenience, maybe
because it is too heavy or occupies too much space in our bags. However, we
cannot ignore the value of coins because there are situations when urgently
needed, but unfortunately, we don't have them or don't have enough. In small
stores or places like Piso nets or other establishments where coins are
necessary, these situations can be very inconvenient because now you have
to find a store to buy something to have your bills changed. Different kinds of
vending machines require coins, like the snack vending machine or the water
vending machine. There are also situations where people have saved money
in their piggy banks and are now filled up, these piggy banks will mostly have
r this reason, the owners might want to have them

coins in them, and fo

changed into cash. While not as severe or as severe as other problems, these

kinds of situations are still inconvenient for many people. And this is precisely

the reason why proponents wanted to conduct a study. The proponents
wanted to give a solution to those inconveniences mentioned, which led them

to create an automated machine that can remedy these inconveniences.

Most of the current change machines only support one type of money
changing process: the bill to coin change process. Therefore, the proponents

decided to develop an automated money changer that can convert cash into

coins and vice versa. Through this, the people may now have a way for them

to have their bills changed to coins and vice versa for whatever specific

reason that they have.

} CHAPTER |
THE PROBLEM AND ITS SCOPE

Introduction

Class scheduling is a common problem of all institution in higher education.
Most often, it is done manually or with the limited help of a simple administrative
system. In Northern Mindanao State Institute of Science and Technology
(NORMISIST), the data representation Object Relational Class Scheduling System
(ORCSS) is introduced to solve the class scheduling problem. This system is given
the major concern in the institute because it involves large scale of time. It is

believed that ORCSS will be a solution to class scheduling problem.

ORCSS is a system where the subject, faculty, time and room are treated as
resources. Each resource is finite and is represented as a set. In using this system
for scheduling, two courses taught by the same faculty member cannot be
scheduled for the same time slot. Similarly, two courses that are required by the
same group of students also should not be conflict. The process of finding a period
for each class so that no conflict will occur is shown in mapping relationship. This
means that each resource is mapped to a value of its domain such that all the

constraints are satisfied. Also, the mapping describes the relationship of each
resource. This description holds an important part in achieving the exact class
schedule. By doing so, each resource is guarded against the other so that no two
schedules would meet in the same time slot.

A mathematical and graphical model is also shown to describe the ORCSS.
This explains some concepts of set relation and graph theory that is used in
representing the relation of each resource. The idea is that every resource is
mapped and matched to the other to meet the required schedule. Assigning each
object to complete a cycle will be further achieved by giving an efficient and
accurate process of scheduling. The mapping gives the best location of each

resource to schedule classes.

"AGGREGATION OF NON-SYNDICATED CONTENT IN A DISTRIBUTED
ENVIRONMENT
","Abstract

The huge amount of information in the web was the driving
motivation to syndicate content over the internet. Syndication specification
emerged such as RSS 0.9, 1.0 and 2.0 to standardize the aggregation of
content. However, even with the advent of RSS technology, there are
websites that don’t have syndication mechanism because of some
underlying technical reason. This study focused on aggregation of non-

syndicated content using container-based approach. An experimental
investigation of non-syndicated website was employed to check and
validate content containers. The container structure is analyzed to
develop an algorithm for container identity extraction. The proof of concept

Introduction

The internet has become more than a household name in today’s activity;
it has become a way of life. The biggest advantage the internet offers is the
information, because the World Wide Web today contains a wealth of
information. Internet becomes virtual treasure trove of information. Many people
nowadays prefer to use the internet for daily news and resources. Society has
become focused around using internet as their first source of information making
the days searching through the library almost obsolete.

Keen Internet users visit many interesting websites and read many
articles. Readers are likely to bookmark web pages they found interesting: that is
the earlier practice of searching, saving web pages for later use. But as the time
goes, re-visiting those saved sites becomes main task for users especially as the
number of bookmarks grows. A better technique for users is to automatically
receive information about updates to their favorite websites — now called as
content aggregation. Figure 1.1 shows the implication when Really Simple

Syndication or Rich Site Summary (RSS) evolved in the World Wide Web.

OLD WAY NEW WAY

In the world of distributed environment resources are countless. Contents
are widely distributed in the web, making internet occupied of masses of

information. Figure 1.2 shows the structure of content distribution in the web.

Figure 1.2 Content distribution in the Web

Content is distributed in the web to make hundreds of millions of pages
available. Sites like blogs, wikis, and other social networks are popular in its
capacity to generate and distribute contents. Aside from social networks, there is
the search engine (such as Google) which has all the idea in submitting web
pages into the users request to find what they are looking for. But before a
search engine could tell where a file or document is, it has to be found first. To
find information on the hundreds of millions of web pages that exist, a search
engine employs special software robots called spiders, to build lots of the words
found on web sites. The idea of spider is also significant in addressing the

a problem of this study. When a spider is building its lists, the process is now called
web crawling. Basically, a spider is just a program that follows links throughout
the internet, grabbing content from sites and adding it to search engines indexes.
Most sites, social networks or search engines now apply syndication, specifically
using RSS technology, in fulfilling its job in distributing contents.

Because of the continuous increase of internet users, resources and
information had also increased and this had practically led to information traffic or
overload which has also resulted into many disadvantages. Such as internet
researches cannot immediately find what they are looking for. It takes time for
them to view all the contents and even follow the links that appear, the moment
they press enter, just to find what they are up to. In other words, contents
delivered by today’s search engines are not at all had committed to the users
best expectations. It can be not just a few of it doesn’t suit to the users need,
one to consider is that users would love to stay updated for current contents.
Speaking of updated contents, these demands had been resolved by the
application of the latest RSS feed technology, the technology that has the power
of managing the contents. RSS or atom feed content become important in
fulfilling this study. Through this, proponents have been able to create a

successful web aggregator. A fine solution that simply makes sense with all the
information presented through searching, and then filtering out information from
what the user would want and from what they don’t want, eliminates time-
consuming visit to a web trying to find for new content, and make great

connection and sharing of resources.
But still there are websites that don’t have RSS feeds. It says an
aggregator can only get content from the other websites if the websites have the
said feeds. Thus, the web technologies that exist now are still in the process of
providing a solution to this deficient.

Furthermore, the proponents had come up to a vital solution in where it

was able to develop a scheme and algorithm to aggregate on non syndicated

web content in a distributed environment.

Introduction

1.1 Background of the Study

Automatic Number Plate Recognition (APNR) is a mass surveillance method that
uses optical character recognition on images to read vehicle registration plates [1]. ANPR
can be used to store the images captured by the cameras as well as the text from the
license plate. It could be used in many applications such as entrance admission, security,
parking control, road traffic control and speed control. In parking, number plates are used
to calculate duration of the parking. When a vehicle enters an input gate, number plate is
automatically recognized and stored in database. When a vehicle later exits the parking
area through an output gate, number plate is recognized again and paired with the first-
one stored in the database. The difference in time is used to calculate the parking fee.
Automatic number plate recognition systems can be used in access control. This
technology was also used in many companies around the world to grant access only to

vehicles of authorized personnel.

In some countries, ANPR systems installed on country borders to automatically detect

INTRODUCTION

Overview

Faculty Object-Relational Mapping Algorithm (FORMA) is one of the most
important roles in class scheduling. Faculty timetabling within colleges and
universities has been a tedious work for school personnel. The scheduling
problem, which has an important role typically in education, is a special version
of designation problem.

This work aims to develop an object-relational mapping algorithm for
faculty for ORCSS. Mapping algorithm is capable of providing faculty with
specific time to all subjects in all courses in an academic year. The limited
number of faculty, room, time, priorities and restriction of usage with the use of
faculty mapping will bring no problems at all.

However, the construction and usage of FORMA provide knowledge in
determining solutions to problems is necessary. For example, Genetic Algorithm
solves NP-hard problems with the help of logic programming. Faculty Object-
Relational Mapping Algorithm is an efficient, effective representation,
optimization and data processes approach suitable for Object-Relational Class
Scheduling System (ORCSS). It is well suited for faculty scheduling problem that
concerned priorities and faculty capability to a certain subject. Since it allows an

object-relational mapping to subject, time and room. It also defines the relations
of one to other resources and their boundaries, thus making it easier to
understand.

Using human resources, scheduling process always solve the assigning of
faculty schedules. During the process, numerous conditions have to be taken into
considerations. It takes along period of time of work even a knowledgeable
person needs just to produce a faculty schedules for an average institution and
the result is often not satisfactory since it does not meet all the requirements.

Moreover, when the preconditions change, the whole works become
unusable and has to be restarted from scratch. Problems of mapping algorithm at
almost all mapping problem is NP-hard. Therefore, only the important conditions
can be considered ania the manual arrangement process, but other important
didactic and department requirements would be very useful. This become into

reality by the tremendous growth of computing capacity.

Knowledge acquisition refers to the task of endowing expert systems with

reasoning method, or a shell, is important, but it is not as important as the
accumulation of high-quality knowledge. The power of an expert system lies in its
store of knowledge about the task domain. The more knowledge a system is
given, the more competent it becomes. Knowledge acquisition is the most
important aspect of the expert system development. It is referred as the process
of getting and transforming appropriate information out of an experts head,
document or any source into some manageable form of the study.

The study concerned with academic advising described a proposed expert

system that composes a phase of knowledge acquisition. It can develop and
transfer of problem solving expertise to computer code. It also develops
productive rules to symbolic logic that is used to represent knowledge and
resolution principle that are also used to represent human reasoning.

The problem of academic advising during enrollment process is just one of
the situations that this institution is facing. Usually advising processes were made
in order for the students to know the subjects which they may be advised to
enroll for the semester. The present academic advising is prone to error such
that most irregular students were able to enroll advance subjects without having
first taken the prerequisite subjects. Others with incomplete grades were
unnoticed. And because of these undesirable bases in academic advising,
dropping and changing of subjects have resulted to a more time consuming and
tedious process.

1.1 Background of the Study

Virtual Reality are based upon theories about a long held human desire to escape
the boundaries of the ‘real world’ by embracing cyberspace. Once there we can interact
with this virtual environment in a more naturalistic manner which will generate new forms
of human-machine interaction (HMI). Virtual reality enables the future development of
many applications such as education, training, athletics, industrial design, architecture and
landscape architecture, urban planning, space exploration, medicine and rehabilitation,
entertainment, and model building and research in many fields of science [1]. The most

famous application of virtual reality is the 3D games.

Doing fitness exercises is an essential daily need to improve health and endurance.
However, in modern society, people do not have many chances to do exercises regularly

in natural environment. This motivates the development of multimedia and interactive
systems to stimulate the excitement for people when doing indoor fitness exercises even at
home, or fitness center, or workplace, Provided with various types of multimedia and

be mapped by barangay according to the level of infection that helps in the decision
making. Aside from the map, the study also automates the method of generating reports
and confirming reported dengue case through mobile technology.

Keywords: Twitter Bootstrap, Mapping System, Mobile Technology.
","1.1 Background and Rationale

Dengue is a devastating viral disease of the tropics, transmitted by mosquitoes,
and causing sudden fever and acute pains in the joints. In a small proportion of cases, the
disease develops into the life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever, resulting in
bleeding, low levels of blood platelets and blood plasma leakage or into dengue shock
syndrome where dangerously low blood pressure occurs. Dengue is transmitted by
several species of mosquito within the genus Aedes, principally A.aegypti. Subsequent
infection with different type increase the risk of severe complications. As there is no
commercially available vaccine, prevention is sought by reducing the habitat and the
number of mosquitoes and limiting exposure to bites.

The number of cases of dengue fever has increased dramatically since the 1960’s,
with between 50 and 528 million people infected yearly. Dengue has become a global

problem since the Second World War and is endemic in more than 110 countries. Apart
tr

from eliminating the mosquitoes, work is ongoing on a dengue vaccine as well as

medication targeted directly at the virus.

Nowadays, the widespread use of Information and Communication Technologies
(ICT) has permeated almost all aspects of life including the healthcare sector, Health
information systems (HIS) was introduced to fully utilize especially the Internet in
providing better healthcare. HIS are frequently refers to the interaction between people,
process and technology to support operations, management in delivering essential
information in order to improve the quality of healthcare services. The health sector has
always relied on technologies in such a way that it become a helping hand for them to
provide better health care services. According to WHO, they form the backbone of the
services to prevent, diagnose, and treat illness and disease. ICTs are only one category of
the vast array of technologies that may be of use. Given the right policies, organization,
resources, and institutions, ICTs can be powerful tools in the hands of those working to
improve health. ICTs have the potential to make a major contribution to improving access
and quality of services while containing costs. Improving health involves improving
public health and medical programs designed to provide elective, emergency, and Long-
term clinical care; educating people; improving nutrition and hygiene; and providing
more sanitary living conditions. These in turn ultimately involve massive social and
economic changes, as many health challenges go well beyond the health sector. On the
other hand, the methods people use to communicate with each other have also changed
significantly. At the present time, the use of mobile technology has become prevalent.
The world is contracting with the growth of mobile phone technology. As the number of

users is increasing day by day, facilities are also increasing. Apparently, the manual
monitoring and tracing of dengue cases is not that really efficient, especially when the
area of operation is located in a remote facility. The existing process which is through
texting the case is very limited and inaccurate. Moreover, there is no facility that can help
in the decision making and monitoring of the affected areas and is not accessible 24/7.
Thus, automation regarding this process is a must.

Mapping of dengue cases through GIS and mobile reporting is an automated
system that enables reporting and gathering of dengue cases here in Butuan City to be
more efficient and convenient, both to the reporting unit and related local government
agencies who needs to facilitate and manage epidemic diseases like dengue. Using the
latest technologies at present times namely the GIS or Geographic information System

Abstract

Bills have now become part in every household’s monthly cycle. Multiple paper bills
from billers are already expected to arrive every month and to pay for all of those is even
one of the reasons why people work hard. To avoid penalties or termination of service, due
dates must be tracked. People have to keep and manage all the paper bills they received for
final transaction and billers have to spend much cost for the production and delivery of
paper bills. All those comes as paper that cannot be reused and multiplies in each customer
as months go by. In the Philippines, smartphone users are rapidly increasing over the years
and estimated to be higher in the coming years. Smartphone promises far more than a more
advanced capability and connectivity for socialization. Utilizing the growing population of
mobile users is the best way to engage in a new way of providing service to customers.
Mobile application will become the people’s avenue for all the interaction they have to deal
with for both social and economic benefits. This study intends to provide a disruptive
innovation in the traditional bill dissemination to save both time and money for customers
and billers through an Android- based mobile application. The proposed mobile
application features a dynamic notification system of the bills a customer received and has
to pay for the given due date. This study also intends to develop a web server for the Open
Billing System(OBS) for the functionality of sending bills on the application. Bills received
in the app is already consolidated in the server which manages all data sent/received to/
from the application. An evaluation was conducted among consumers to perceive their

Introduction

This chapter mainly focuses on introducing the study’s aims, background, and the

current problems in billing dissemination and tracking of bill due dates among different

billers.

1.1 Background of the Study

From generation to generation, new technologies emerged which changed the way
business works and replace many human-driven business processes or transaction.
Computers together with its hardware and software components for example replaces data

sheets in storing, managing and processing data through databases and other software like

excel.

Concerns about having a sustainable development in the Philippines are being
raised in different fields as it paves its way to modern developments but a high shifting of
demands among the businesses and consumers is carried along with this progress. One of
those is the increasing demand of services from different companies like
telecommunications, utilities sectors, and financial companies to provide services in
households.

In most companies, it is common to release statement billings to their customers.

This is traditionally printed on papers and sent to each addresses of all corresponding
customers. For this reason, many companies need the supply of paper for the production
of their statement billings for a vast number of customers. Number of trees that are being
cut down is becoming greater. As the number of human population grow, the number of
customers in every business also increase and so it is with the number of paper waste
produced from all the previous paper bills. Another problem arising from this situation is
that customers have to keep many statement bills.

Most of the business organizations have not engaged in the advanced technologies
considering the need of their customers to acquire more knowledge for new processes, and
for security concerns. However, these reasons will not hinder innovation to take place in
businesses anymore because there are new technologies possessed by business
organizations and even the customers that they are now more attentive in dealing with
technology trends [20]. Smartphone users in the Philippines is estimated to reach 33.3
million for 2017 [26]. Smartphone promises far more than a more advanced capability and

connectivity for socialization. This is a good factor for companies and service providers to
make use of this technology to engage in e- Commerce to lower cost while improving
customer service.
Embracing new technologies might be the best option for companies in this fast-

growing society. The electronic billing approach is not unfamiliar to the customers. After
the arrival of the Internet, online payment and other online transactions were introduced to
the consumers. Some of the customers paid online after receiving their paper bills ina cycle
[4]. What is to make new is making use of the growing population of smartphone users and
even to users of older model of cellphones where they can view or received text of their
updated billing information wherever they may be and in just one place — on their phones.
This thesis entitled “Android-Based Open Billing System with Dynamic Data Routing”,
aims to provide cost and time savings for customers and for telecommunications, utilities

sectors and other billing companies where bills number in the hundreds of thousands to

millions each month.

","1.1 Background of the Study

Mobile technologies have been so popular in our era today. It rapidly changed our
daily life routines in many aspects and makes life our easier. Mobile devices are now
accepted and used worldwide. Researchers found out the potential and significance of
mobile technologies. As technology evolves, text can now be represents in an image

form. One way to present this is the use of Quick Response (QR) codes.

Quick Response Codes were invented developed by Denso Corporation in 1994.
Quick Response Code is a 2D barcode which can encode letters, numbers and kanji
characters. These days, QR codes can now be read by devices using QR readers or Smart
phones. QR codes spread widely all over in the business industry. Nowadays, QR codes

are now be used to hide details such as; URL, business name, etc. Hiding information in
Ne

QR code is quite cool and has a large storage capacity and fast-readable than UPC
barcodes, QR code has become a focus of advertising strategy, since it provides a way to

access a brand's website more quickly than by manually entering a URL [1].

QR codes has a high resistant to damage and can read the data inside the QR code
even if has a damage. QR code has different features namely; data restoration capability,
360 degree reading, high capacity, reduced space encoding and efficient in encoding
characters. There are four levels of error correction that you can choose from. The lowest
is L, which allows the code to be read even if 7% of it is unreadable. After that is M,
which provides 15% error correction, then Q, which provides 25%, and finally H, which
provides 30% [9]. Different levels of error correction may result to different sizes of QR
codes; the higher the error correction level requires more bytes so the larger the QR code
might be. Each mode (numeric, alphanumeric, bytes and kanji) encodes the text as a
string of bits (1s and Os), but each mode uses a different method for converting the text
into bits. Each method is optimized to generate the shortest possible string of bits for that

data type [2].

QR code uses different state of the art algorithms and complex mathematics
structure to encode the data efficiently. Data in QR code must be arranged according to
its original text structure. In industry, manual filling up the forms with the same
information’s needed are time consuming and costly due to possible human errors. Thus,
by collecting different standard forms (e.g. PhilHealth, Pag-ibig, General Employment,
etc.) and by studying the mutual its fields and category the proponent had built an android

Virtual assistance has been already used in the market to provide remote

administrative, technical, and/or creative support services. Most of them were deployed
in business and education. Computer-generated and graphical schemes become popular

recently in this field to make possibilities to a user/client to be guided on the transactions.

Checking up possible learning materials for the given topic could give strenuous
job to both library attendant and to the students. However, because of the advantage of

the technology today, this can be possibly done in more efficient and quicker way

through the use of virtual assistance.

Some systems were taking the advantage of image processing by using face
detection and recognition. In this manner, comparing a human face pattern to an actual

human face would give faster and resourceful system through linking and tracking user’s
upcoming activities.
In this paper, a virtual assistant is being integrated with face recognition for a

ABSTRACT

Library is a place set apart to contain books, periodicals, and other
material for reading, viewing, listening, study, or reference, as a room, Or building
where books may be read or borrowed. Caraga State University (CSU) librarian
is responsible for the arrangement of library material including the assigning of
the call numbers of the book. Call numbers consist of three parts; class number,
author number, year publication. Author number is one of the components of call
number in which it provides subject access to collections and is means by which
access can be provided to network resources. It consists of initial name and
cutters number. The assignment of the author number of the book in CSU library
is in a manual process; hence the researchers would like to provide a system

that can help the librarian to produce an author number with less time and effort.

This software project is intended for enhancing the current process of Book

Author Numbering. The system used the Amzi! Prolog version 5.0 as the logic
programming language, Visual Basic 6.0 as the graphical interface and MySQL
5.0 as the data storage. This system can be used specifically by the CSU
librarian and the e-lib administrator, also to those persons whose job is related in
book assigning. They can use the system for the generation of the author

numbers.

Consequently, the development of this software would be a better means

to lessen the time and efforts in generating author number.

INTRODUCTION

Call number is a single most important device for the arrangement of
library materials. It is like an address; it tells you where the book is located on the
shelf. Call numbers consist of three parts - the class number, the author numbers
and lastly the year publication. Author number is one of the components of call
numbers in which it provides subject access to collections and means by which
access can be provided to network resources. It consists of initial name and
cutters number.

Caraga State University librarian is responsible for the arrangement of
library material including the assignment of author numbers. The head librarian,
Mrs. Ma. Corazon Tercera is the one who administered the process of getting an
author number on the book in the library. Moreover, there are different basis in
producing it such as being based on the main author of the book, the title of the

book, name of biographies, and lastly the first word of the title of the articles.

Presently, the assignment of authors number in the library is still ona
manual process. However, the current process is quite time-consuming and less
efficient since existing author number records and the Cutters Author Table
manual are the tools in producing an author number. Thus, this study -
Automated Book Author Numbering, aims to enhance the present author
numbering process by simulating a knowledge-based system that will aid in the

auto-generation of author number based from the main author's name.
The processes in getting an author number are the following: (1)
determining the initial characters of the author, (2) scanning the whole listed data
in the Cutter’s Author Table manual for the corresponding number of the author,
and lastly (3) combining the results of steps 1 and 2.

The study only focuses on the main author's name entry.

Moreover, this tool could allow libraries further to adjust workflow to take

best advantage of it.

THE PROBLEM

Introduction

Teenage pregnancy is a controversial issue because it effects society as a
whole. Teenage mothers often raise children who never learn how to live
productive lifestyles. Negative elements like drug addiction and crime seem to
be the only outlets that are available to lonely, confused children who live in

poverty-stricken cities. For many of these children end up having their own

children at an early age.

Teenage girls that get pregnant in our community become overwhelmed
with the pressures of supporting their children financially while trying to instill
morals and ethics in their lives. We as community need to come together with
the government and help these mothers out. The problems of a teenage mother
and her children eventually become the problem of all of society, Children come
first because they are our future . Every Child in the country should be afforded
on equal opportunity to succeed no matter its family, racial, or financial
background. Supporting teen mothers and their families and educating people
about the responsibilities and the risk of having sex can do this .

Teenage pregnancy also has economic consequences. Child bearing may

curtail education and thereby reduce a young woman's employment prospects in
2
a job market that requires ever higher levels of training. Consequently, most
teenage mothers lack a partner to contribute to the household income.

The social stigma that once attended out-of wedlock pregnancy may have
diminished; however, the risk of serious health consequences remain for babies
to born to mothers still in their teens.

Children of teenagers are more likely to have low birth weights, and to
suffer the associated health problems.

This study was conducted to find out the cause and effect of pregnancy
of teens and what «, this unit can do to assist their present predicament.
Although the Health Report sees this study as beneficial to the child as a
student, yet parents and teenagers can hardly accept it . But designing effective
solutions will require the thoughtful separation of fact, assumption that much is

still not fully understood about the causes of teenage pregnancy. (Heather

Degree: Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
Adviser: James V. Presbitero

Host Institution: Northern Mindanao State Institute of Science and Technology

The study of Computer-Aided Enrolment Scheduling System was
designed to come up with an efficient and accurate class scheduler to be used in
Northern Mindanao State Institute of Science and Technology. The researchers
set the resources such as the subject, faculty, room, and time as the primary
base information needed in creating the schedules, These resources have been
scheduled properly, meeting certain conditions in order to have a desired class
schedule.

These conditions are; a.) The slot for that specified schedule is not yet
occupied and does not violate any other assignments. This assures that
duplication of schedules will be headed off, b.) All the resources being scheduled
are free from conflicts and have not been used for other allocation. As for the
instance of time allocation, half hour conflicts could be avoided. c.) The use of

the resources for each class schedule is free from any restrictions.
The scheduler was made through MySQL, a relational database used as a
_ device in accessing, adding, and organizing the data in order to meet the
: prescribed schedule. MS Visual Basic is the programming language used. In
addition, ODBC was used to connect the databases. The idea of Client/Server
_ and networking was also applied. It also allows the method of drag and dropping
in making schedules for faculty, subject and class.

It was found out that through the use of all these tools and ideas, accurate

_ 4nd efficient schedule is possible. And that it meet its objectives to have an

improved and alternative approach in making schedules which assist the
administrator in designating the room, time, faculty, and subject.

Enrolment process could be better performed through the scheduler.
","Introduction

Northern Mindanao State Institute of Science and Technology like any
other institutions adheres to the trend of computerization. Our institution
continues its search to seek solutions for problems, which deals with works done
by hand.
One situation that this institution is facing is the perennial problem of class
scheduling. Oftentimes, scheduling of classes was done manually where
administrator(s) who were tasked to do the work spent a lot of time to create the
appropriate class schedule to be used for the enrolment process. The procedure
is prone to error and was tedious.

The current scheduling process frequently caused the delay of classes.
Some instructors could not start their classes right away due to the conflicting
time of their subject loads. Another was that classes were not yet assigned to
any room to where they could conduct their class. Also some subjects have not
yet been assigned to their respective instructors.

These were some of the problems — waded conditions which beset from

the present scheduling procedure. This called for alternative systems and

approaches.

Introduction

The mechanization of translation has been one of humanity's oldest dreams. In the

twentieth century it has become a reality, in the form of computer programs capable of translating

a wide variety of texts from one natural language into another. But, as ever, reality is not perfect.
There are no ‘translating machines ‘, which at the touch of a few buttons can take any text in any
language and produce a perfect translation in any other language without human intervention or
assistance. That is an ideal for the distant future, if it is even achievable in principle, which many
doubt.

What has been achieved is the development of programs, which can produce ‘raw’
translation of texts in relatively well-defined subject domains, which can be revised to give good-
quality translated text at an economically viable rate or which in their unedited state can be read
and understood by specialist in the subject for information purposes. In some cases, with
appropriate controls on the language of the input texts, translation can be produced automatically
that are of higher quality needing little or no revision.

These are solid achievements by what is now traditionally called Machine Translation, but
they have often been obscured and misunderstood. The public perception of MT is distorted by
two extreme positions. On the one hand, there are those who are unconvinced that there is
anything difficult about analyzing, language, since even young children are able to leam
languages so easily; and who are convinced that anyone who knows a foreign language must be
able to translate with ease. Hence, they are unable to appreciate the difficulties of the task or how
much has been achieved. On the other hand, there are no human translators can translate in an
instant, And also takes a lot of money to pay a high paid human translator and also the availability

of the human translators difficult to determined.

ing schedules for a large scheduling task to the administrative personnel is

to come up with a non-conflicting data is very difficult to manipulate.

In some situations, the distance of room, time gap, subject priority check, load

To solve this problem, the researchers developed an algorithm to generate a
good and efficient schedule. This study used a sequential searching algorithm that
manipulates data from the beginning of record until a certain condition meet the
required resources needed in completing the task.

The computer generated scheduler is necessary in this institution since it is faster

","CHAPTER 1

INTRODUCTION

Faculty class scheduling is a common problem of all institutions in higher
education. Some of this task is done manually or with the help of simple administrative
system. Faculty time tabling in colleges and universities has been a tedious work for
school personnel. In Northern Mindanao State Institute of Science and Technology
(NORMISIST) the algorithm representation of Computer Generated Scheduling System
(CoGeSS) is introduced to solve the faculty class-scheduling problem. The scheduling
problem, which has an important role typically in education, has a version of designation
problem.

This work aims to develop a complete scheduling system for the faculty of
NORMISIST and any other institution. The proposed software is capable of providing
faculty with specific time to all subjects in all courses in every academic year. In using
this system, two subjects taught by one faculty member cannot be scheduled in the
same time slot. Similarly, two subjects that are required by the same group of students
should not be in conflict. The process of finding a period for each class so that no
conflict occurs will be generated using the scheduling software. Also, the mapping
describes the relationship of each resource. This description holds an important part in
achieving the exact ciass schedule. By doing this, each response is guarded against the

other so that no two schedules would meet in the same time slot.

The construction of the proposed software provides efficient solution to
conflicting schedules in different resources. Some institutions are creating a facuity-to-
student schedule manually. It takes time to work with class schedules for an average

institution and the result is not satisfactory since it does not meet some of the

1
requirements needed. Using this software, faculty-to-student scheduling probiem wiii be
solved satisfactorily. It can generate a complete schedule to every resource without any
conflict to every clement of the set of resources. It also allows time exemption for

special activities and the faculty can choose their own reservations for time exemption.

information of the recognized plate number was automatically saved into the database
associated to the date and time arrival as it enters the gates of the establishments, once the
system cannot recognize the detected plate numbers, the image would also be saved into
the database. The recognition rate depends on the clarity of images feed to the system, the

1.1 Background of the Study

Automatic Number Plate Recognition (APNR) is a mass surveillance method that
uses optical character recognition on images to read vehicle registration plates [1]. ANPR
can be used to store the images captured by the cameras as well as the text from the
license plate. It could be used in many applications such as entrance admission, security,
parking control, road traffic control and speed control. In parking, number plates are used
to calculate duration of the parking. When a vehicle enters an input gate, number plate is
automatically recognized and stored in database. When a vehicle later exits the parking
area through an output gate, number plate is recognized again and paired with the first-
one stored in the database. The difference in time is used to calculate the parking fee.
Automatic number plate recognition systems can be used in access control. This
technology was also used in many companies around the world to grant access only to
vehicles of authorized personnel.

In some countries, ANPR systems installed on country borders to automatically detect
and monitor border crossings. Each number plate of vehicle can be stored in a central
database for future uses such as tracing of a black list of stolen vehicles.

This research study aims to develop an ANPR system using functional infrared web
cam. Moreover, the use of various techniques for the detection of number plates such as
pre-processing, number plate localization, character segmentation and character

recognition are to be applied in the development of the study.

"AGGREGATION OF NON-SYNDICATED CONTENT IN A DISTRIBUTED
ENVIRONMENT
","Abstract

The huge amount of information in the web was the driving
motivation to syndicate content over the internet. Syndication specification
emerged such as RSS 0.9, 1.0 and 2.0 to standardize the aggregation of
content. However, even with the advent of RSS technology, there are
websites that don’t have syndication mechanism because of some
underlying technical reason. This study focused on aggregation of non-

syndicated content using container-based approach. An experimental
investigation of non-syndicated website was employed to check and

validate content containers. The container structure is analyzed to

develop an algorithm for container identity extraction. The proof of concept

is implemented using XPATH and Jquery.
","The internet has become more than a household name in today’s activity;
it has become a way of life. The biggest advantage the internet offers is the
information, because the World Wide Web today contains a wealth of
information. Internet becomes virtual treasure trove of information. Many people
nowadays prefer to use the internet for daily news and resources. Society has
become focused around using internet as their first source of information making
the days searching through the library almost obsolete.

Keen Intemet users visit many interesting websites and read many
articles. Readers are likely to bookmark web pages they found interesting: that is
the earlier practice of searching, saving web pages for later use. But as the time
goes, re-visiting those saved sites becomes main task for users especially as the
number of bookmarks grows. A better technique for users is to automatically
receive information about updates to their favorite websites — now called as
content aggregation. Figure 1.1 shows the implication when Really Simple

Syndication or Rich Site Summary (RSS) evolved in the World Wide Web.
In the world of distributed environment resources are countless. Contents
are widely distributed in the web, making internet occupied of masses of

information. Figure 1.2 shows the structure of content distribution in the web.

Figure 1.2 Content distribution in the Web

Content is distributed in the web to make hundreds of millions of pages
available. Sites like blogs, wikis, and other social networks are popular in its
capacity to generate and distribute contents. Aside from social networks, there is
the search engine (such as Google) which has all the idea in submitting web
pages into the users request to find what they are looking for. But before a
search engine could tell where a file or document is, it has to be found first. To
find information on the hundreds of millions of web pages that exist, a search
engine employs special software robots called spiders, to build lots of the words
found on web sites. The idea of spider is also significant in addressing the

problem of this study. When a spider is building its lists, the process is now called
Ww

web crawling. Basically, a spider is just a program that follows links throughout
the internet, grabbing content from sites and adding it to search engines indexes.
Most sites, social networks or search engines now apply syndication, specifically
using RSS technology, in fulfilling its job in distributing contents.

Because of the continuous increase of internet users, resources and
information had also increased and this had practically led to information traffic or
overload which has also resulted into many disadvantages. Such as internet
researches cannot immediately find what they are looking for. It takes time for
them to view all the contents and even follow the links that appear, the moment
they press enter, just to find what they are up to. In other words, contents
delivered by today’s search engines are not at all had committed to the users
best expectations. It can be not just a few of it doesn’t suit to the user's need,
one to consider is that users would love to stay updated for current contents.
Speaking of updated contents, these demands had been resolved by the
application of the latest RSS feed technology, the technology that has the power
of managing the contents. RSS or atom feed content become important in
fulfilling this study. Through this, proponents have been able to create a
successful web aggregator. A fine solution that simply makes sense with all the
information presented through searching, and then filtering out information from
what the user would want and from what they don’t want, eliminates time-
consuming visit to a web trying to find for new content, and make great

connection and sharing of resources.
But still there are websites that don’t have RSS feeds. It says an
aggregator can only get content from the other websites if the websites have the
said feeds. Thus, the web technologies that exist now are still in the process of
providing a solution to this deficient.

Furthermore, the proponents had come up to a vital solution in where it
was able to develop a scheme and algorithm to aggregate on non syndicated

web content in a distributed environment.

","BIN BINS PU Ae

Automation has great importance nowadays especially in every institution. It
plays an increasingly important role in the global economy and in daily experience. It
will not just improve the work efficiency; it also gives a reliable tool for various
operations in the institution. Paper- based document circulation is a tedious work and it is
also hard to keep track. The proponents will develop a system that could help the
employees in Caraga State University (CSU) especially in document processing. This
institution is comprised of different offices like the college and universities all over the

world who aspire modernization of systems.

CSU aims to provide a better service not just to the students but also to the faculty
as well and to compete with other high standard colleges and universities, not only in

Caraga, but also in other regions, especially in terms of Information Technology.

The transaction of documents in CSU is handled manually. Some of these
documents are the Purchase Request, Quotation, Bidding, Purchase Order and Abstract of
Quotation. These documents have to be signed by different office heads. These
documents passed from one office to the next until all the required signatures have been
affixed. The documents are to be logged in the logbook whenever it arrives in an office

by a clerk or any employee assigned to it. Whenever there will be mistakes in the
document, the office head will attach comments or a note that will notify the requisitioner

about the mistakes or lack in his/her document.

An office head or a clerk may follow up or track the requested document

personally or by just calling the offices involved in si gning the document.

The other offices do not apply or do the practice of logging in the document
received and, because of this; it causes problems in the tracking of the document. This

will result to the loss of the said document since there is no way to trace where it went.

An automated document tracking is needed to solve those problems. It will trace
the document sent by the requisitioner by simply viewing it at the system which is
embedded in the CSU website. But before the tracking of the document can be done, the
requisitioner will make a circulation first by simply doing it to his page in the system
after giving the document to the first receiver or signatory. And after that, he will just
wait in the office where he/she belongs and can track the document by looking it at the
page provided for him/her.

One of the advantages that the institution could get in adopting the proposed
Document Circulation System is that it would give them access to the documents being
transacted by inquiring online. This system tries to give some information to the sender
about his transaction. Through online tracking, the user can easily access the information

and from time to time update the said document.
Implementing this system in this institution does not require changing the way
the employees work to improve the efficiency of their work processes. With a quality
web- based document circulation system as the solution; one can work the way one
always have without the clutter and limitations of paper. In fact, according to research
conducted by the Gartner Group when implementing a document circulation management

solution, the organization will reduce overall document- related costs by 40% [1].

Document Circulation System is a system that tracks the document. This system
is generally responsible for the processing and inquiring the information through an
online system, which is utilized in order to discharge the function. This involves a
considerable number of offices and departments considering the fact that these offices
and departments are situated in a geographical challenging location. This system will
help develop the current system so as to make the work lighter and faster - eradicating
delays of time. This system aims to provide the fastest accessibility of information

through online system. It will process the display of information and the status of their

documents.

Users are able to define documents which are sent step by step to every
office/user in a list. It is an electronic way in doing internal document circulations. The
physical location and actions taken to a document can be easily and quickly confirmed.
There may be advantages and disadvantages regarding the adoption of the system, yet
introducing a more efficient system like the Document Circulation System would provide

a new avenue for further improvement and better service to its clienteles.
Most tracking and circulation of documents are done by a clerk through recording
the numbers or punching it into the computer by hand. But the falling price of computer
coding technology now makes it very affordable for every institution to keep track of
every document with unbeatable accuracy, and even track the document as they move
from one process to another through the organization or hierarchy. This enables an
organization or hierarchy to automate paper- based requisitioning processes without
having to install software on each computer. Requesitioners are given access to transact

their request online without experiencing any hassle in processing the transaction.
Requestioners just have to log in with their username and password, input the document’s

identification number and they can do their transaction on-line. Tracking is possible in

just a minute.

One of the most important factors in how successful a document circulation
system will be is its being user-friendly. Usability is critical in encouraging rapid staff
acceptance. A system will only be widely used if it simple to capture, organize and find
documents. The best system are user- friendly and flexible enough to adapt to the way
people already work in an organization, rather than forcing them to change their preferred
way of working. A document can be assembled from input fields that could be filled in
by the receiver of the document. So after a document has completed its circulation, one
will have a completely filled in document. Also attachments to the document are

possible.
To guarantee that a document circulation system is readily accepted by the users

throughout an institution, it is important that the graphic interfaces for common
operations, such as search and retrieval, are clear and easy-to-use. User-friendly
interfaces not only assure rapid adoption of the document circulation system by staff, but

they also reduce training expenses associated with implementations.

Aside from an automated document circulation system that is easy to use, it
should also be easy to set up. There is no need for the staff to go on tutorials or do some

workshops for them to learn the basic process of the proposed system, the document

circulation system.

Automated document circulation management systems are software applications
that capture paper documents and a variety of electronic files while providing for the
storage, retrieval, security and archiving these documents. The document circulation
management process begins with the conversion of paper documents and records to

electronic files. Conversion eliminates many of the obstacles created by the paper: labor-
intensive duplication procedures, slow distribution, misplaced originals and the
inconvenience of retrieving files from off-site storage. Because paper files are also costly
to process, duplicate, distribute and store, automating paper archives ultimately reduces
operating expenses and overheads. It can capture and import tools to bring documents
into the system. It has a method of storing and archiving documents. It has an indexing

and retrieval tools to locate documents. It can distribute tools for exporting documents

from the system and it has a security to protect the documents from unauthorized access.
Workflow systems are designed to automate document processes. Document

workflow systems allow institution to define and control all the steps of a document

process. Such systems provide institution/s with increased productivity, improved

student/s service, and tighter quality controls. Workflow systems can stand alone or be

combined with an imaging application.

A workflow system enables an electronic document, such as a purchase request
or payment warrant, to move from individual to individual along a pre-determined

purchasing authorization (for approval) path and along a pre-defined payment

authorization path.

This research is a decision support system that evaluates the productivity of each

office and determines its performance in processing a document.

1.1 Background of the Study

The advancements in technology have made great changes in the Philippines.
These changes are seen in the agricultural field of our country. Through the integration of
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) with agriculture many innovations
have been made such as in rice production.

Rice has always been one of the major crops the country produces. Nutrient
management in rice production plays a vital role in producing quality crops. Rice plants
need the right combination of nutrients to live and grow. When rice plants suffer from
malnutrition, they show symptoms of being unhealthy. Too little or too much of any one
nutrient can cause problems. Farmers usually have difficulties in identifying rice nutrient
disorders, which can be a mineral deficiency or toxicity. It is important to identify the

nutrient disorder especially in the vegetative stage of the rice crop |! With these to
consider, the researchers wish to create an automated diagnostic tool for rice nutrient
disorders. The diagnostic tool is an artificial intelligence software, known as an expert
system I,

The researchers are motivated in doing the study because we believe that this
would help farmers in producing a higher yield of quality rice. With an expert system that
emulates a specialist in the field of agriculture, farmers can easily identify the rice
nutrient disorder by themselves. Thus, the study will greatly help in the agricultural field

Introduction

Internet's World Wide Web (www) is an ideal medium of record keeping. There are many

advantages that have been explored to use the Web as an educational tool. But on-line recording
remains a minimal practice.

The existing record system of NORMISIST Science Laboratory is manual-based, in terms
of record-keeping process. The major task of the laboratory in-charge includes releasing and
recording of chemicals and materials borrowed by students. The filled-up borrower slip will serve
as a vital record and evidence of borrower's accountabilities in case of damage or lost items.

Problems encountered in using the manual method includes slow retrieval and
processing of data, no database handler, and slow process of tracking of consumable materials,
equipments and apparatuses. This study shall, therefore, transform the manual-based system
into a web-based system. Web- based is a program that runs on any computer connected to the

intemet with control feature using the simple Web interface that a browser provides.

The recommended system will give safer repository of records maintaining accuracy and
reliability, fast retrieval of files from the data storage, a good database handler and faster process
tracking of materials, equipments and apparatuses.

Building an electronic record keeping is very advantageous or useful to the education
sector or organization by shifting paper records to an electronic records processing system. It is
beneficial to the in-charge personnel as it effectively provides effective and efficient service and
makes searching, retrieval, tracking and updating of records, and facilitating transactions much
easier. This project can lead to the implementation of a new web-based System that will transform
the way records processes are handled.

"“A KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEM ON IDENTIFYING MANGO
DISEASES
","iil

ABSTRACT

In today’s global financial economic crisis, hiring a consultant in a specific field
of expertise to solve a certain kind of problems is very expensive. In the field of
agriculture, where we deal with the production of crops to export, is one the affected
areas in the economy. Exported commodity, such as mango is one of our primary
concerns, aside from the economic crisis; one of the factors affecting the production of
mango is the diseases that can affect the high quality in the export industry. Since
expertise is difficult to acquire and human experts are expensive and in short supply, this
paper presents the use of Knowledge base System to solve the problems that is faced by
the agricultural entrepreneurs in the Philippines. A random research was done and the
researchers found out the fourteen (14) kinds of common diseases in the Philippines
namely: Gummosis, Scab, Diplodia stem end rot, Anthracnose, Sooty mould, Fruit rot,
Pink disease, Die back, Angular leaf spot, seed rot, Phoma blight, Backterial canker,

Blossom blight, and Powdery mildew. Thus, the Researchers would like to propose a

knowledge Base System on Identifying Mango Diseases to solve these problems.
","CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTION

It is readily accepted that increased information flow has a positive effect on the
agricultural sector and individual firms. However, collecting and disseminating
information is often difficult and costly. Information Technology (IT) offers the ability to
increase the amount of information provided to all participants in the agricultural sector
and to decrease the cost of disseminating the information. An understanding of the factors
associated with IT adoption and use in agriculture will enable the development of
strategies to promote IT adoption and increase the effectiveness and efficiency of

information used in agriculture.

Knowledge based systems is one Application of Information Technology to the
agricultural sector, knowledge base is a special kind of database for knowledge
management, providing the means for the computerized collection, organization, and
retrieval of knowledge. Also collections of data representing related experiences, their

results are related to their problems and solutions.

The use of knowledge based system especially on the identification of diseases
will be a great help to the agricultural sectors. The Philippine Mango also known as the
Carrabao mango is tagged as the sweetest variety of mango in the whole world; it can be

harvested in Guemaras Island the mango capital of the Philippines.

It is encouraging to note that the importance of the mango industry to the

Philippine economy is now being recognized by all sectors. The mango industry has
N

provided livelihood opportunities to its growers and to those who involved in marketing
channels. Similarly, it has significantly contributed to the country’s export earnings, being
the third ranking fruit export, next to banana and pineapple. The Philippines is the
seventh biggest mango producing country in the world, next to India, China, Mexico,
Thailand, Indonesia and Pakistan. However, the identification on the number of diseases

affecting the mango production in the Philippines is relatively few, thus, seriously

limiting the production.

In Caraga Region, there are only few noted experts that can help the mango
growers diagnose and identify the mango diseases. Service of the consultants that are
sought for technical advice related to this field is expensive. Experts on this field are
specialized and very limited. They are not easily sought since experts in this country are
only few. Also, not all mango growers are equipped with specialized skills to identify
mango diseases. Most mango farmers largely rely on common knowledge and practices.
Almost all growers do not even have access to information in relation to mango disease
identification. Lastly, going through the manual and normal process of disease

identification is a tedious process. It takes time, effort and money especially that it entails

laboratory services.

In order to help the mango grower’s the researchers introduce the Knowledge-
Based System on identifying mango diseases. The system will identify the occurrence of
the diseases on mangoes through its symptoms and provide recommendations on how to
control the disease for a proper counter measure by transferring the human expertise into

the computer.

"Using Mapping System for Proactive Crime Management and Reporting for BCPO
","vi

Abstract

Technology has played a major part of today’s world. Development of various automated
information systems are rampant because of its proven significance to different institutions.
It is why proponents of this project have sought to answer the manual way of management
and reporting crimes. This study came up with a web-based system for both police and
general users, plus an android application for a more accessible reporting system. The
purpose of this study is to receive reports from concerned citizens of Butuan City about
crime incident that is happening within the vicinity. Thus, Butuan City Police Office can
respond immediately. Crime being an act against the law of a society is a threat to the well-
being of the populace and so, requires efficient and effective monitoring. This system have
been developed to achieve this purpose. However, the BCPO uses a traditional way of
managing and reporting crimes, which is, the use of pen and paper. This records are
therefore susceptible to destruction from pests and uncensored manipulation by both
authorized and unauthorized personnel. This crude method has resulted in problems in the
areas of authenticity, security, retrieval, storage, and exchange of information within
BCPO. In developing this system, the waterfall model of system development was adopted
through the stages of requirement elicitation from stakeholders to the systems design and
analysis using tools such as entity relationship diagram for the database, context diagram
and data flow diagram which describe user and system requirements. The system was
implemented using PHP for a highly interactive graphical user interface, and MySQL for
a robust database. The system enhances efficiency in correcting the problems earlier stated
and it is an effective tool for easy analysis of data which will improve the BCPO’s law
enforcement operations. The implementation of this system will result in lower crime rate
within Butuan City.

Keywords: BCPO, PHP, MySQL, Waterfall Model
","1.1 Background and Rationale

Information is very important in crime management analysis. Arguably, the most
important weapon in law enforcement has always been information management
especially location information. The location of crime is vital information for a law
enforcement officer, the Police service, the public and the government. The correct use of
information is highly dependent on the available information system. Traditional law
enforcement for different types of applications deals with data collection and how this
data flows from one section of police to another in order to respond to the needs of
society [1].

Law enforcement agencies, in their endeavor to improve efficiency and
effectiveness in the service provision, are computerizing their information systems.
Different data such as location, crime and socio-demographic are being integrated using
the capabilities offered by technology. Non-traditional sources of law enforcement data
have been identified to provide data to the Butuan City is the Regional Center of the

CARAGA Administrative Region. Butuan became a city by virtue of Republic Act No.

Police Office (BCPO) is situated at the heart of the City fronting Guingona Park at J.C,
Aquino Avenue corner A.D. Curato Street. It is composed of five (5) police stations
namely: Butuan City Police Station 1 (BCPS1) which is co-located at BPCO Hqs; Butuan
City Police Station 2 (BCPS2) located at Langihan Public Market: Butuan City Police
Station 3 (BCPS 3) at Brgy Ambago; Butuan City Police Station 4 (BCPS 4) at Brgy
Ampayon and Butuan City Police Station 5 (BCPS 5) located at Brgy San Mateo. BCPO
has one Sub-Station (Ong Yiu Sub-Station) located at Brgy Ong Yiu and two (2) Police
Outposts located at Brgy Pagatpatan and Langihan Bus Terminal.

Comparative Crime Statistics from January-June 2015, as compared to the same
period in 2014, a significant decrease of 1,614 incidents or 18.17% were recorded. Crime
Statistics by Province, for the period January - June 2015, BCPO gained the highest
Crime Volume with 2,320 incidents followed by Surigao del Norte with 1,543 incidents

and Dinagat Islands who gained the Lowest Crime Volume of 250 (Regional Crime

Statistics, PNP Police Regional Office 13 CARAGA website).

. ; an? itv is at stake. The current manual process
rates are also increasing and the citizen’s security 1S i

in reporting a crime takes time to fill in the crime incident report form and takes time to

go to the nearest police station possible. The proponents’ idea to address this kind of
incident has surfaced that the private citizens should be encouraged to report on any
suspicious activities they witnessed right at the moment where the crime happens.

To help in addressing crime, the proponents proposed to develop a proactive
crime management and reporting system that uses a map to visualize crime rate within
the city. The system will be able to generate a report to display crime hotspots within the
city, so that BCPO can create a preventive action in advance.

Using Mapping System for Proactive Crime Reporting and Management for

"Vicinity Map using Scalable Vector Graphics
","Abstract

Google Maps Android API, you can add maps based on Google Maps data to your

application. The API automatically handles access to Google Maps servers, data

downloading, map display, and response to map gestures. Drawing to view is a better

option when your UI does not require dynamic changes in the application. The most

convenient aspect of doing so is that the Android framework will provide you with a pre-
defined Canvas to which you will place your drawing calls.. Scalable Vector Graphics
(SVG) is defined by XML format. Unlike bitmap image formats such as JPG or PNG, it
does not consist of a fixed set of dots, but of shapes and their attributes, so it can be saved
as the smallest size possible. No matter how large the graphic gets, the XML that
describes the graphic is the only thing transmitted to the client. Android development
faces different limitations inside in its software development kit with the help of different
developers they created open source libraries to defeat this limitations. Google App
Engine applications are easy to create, easy to maintain, and easy to scale as your traffic
and data storage needs change. With App Engine, there are no servers to maintain.

World is contracting with the growth of mobile phone technology. As a number of
users is increasing day by day, facilities are also increasing. Whether you are technical or
non-technical, it is often difficult to make sense of the ever-changing world of
telecommunications. Technology seems to advance at an accelerating pace, complicating
the business case on the one hand and confusing the customer on the other. The traditionally
separate fixed, mobile, and internet sectors are now converging into a single sector with

implications for both technology and business.

When you use the Google Maps APIs, it brings the best of google maps in building
mapping applications built with the capabilities and it enhances the production of the

business. Importantly with its capabilities Google Maps makes users more convenient in

locating places especially for the tourist.
Vicinity map is beneficial to business establishment, making one client/customer
easy to find, and thus it gives both the owner/organization and the client a big favor. It will
create a better frame of mind for the organization by cutting out the frustration of finding
their way to the client. It will also do the organization a great service too, by cutting the
time wasted with late meetings and appointments. SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is the
simplest and very progressive format when it comes to images. Furthermore, SVG allows

Web developers and designers to implement dynamically generated, high-quality graphics
from real-time data with precise structural and visual control. With this powerful new
technology, SVG developers have the possibility to create a new generation of Mobile/W eb

applications based on data-driven, interactive and personalized graphics.

on the Identification of Volume of Solid Waste Collection in Butuan City helped the
Garbage Collection Office do transactions easily with the help of the system via SMS.
Sending through SMS is definitely effective in terms of managing time and work.

Keywords: SMS, Ozeki, and Garbage.
","1.1 Background and Rationale

In the past century, as the world's population has grown and become more urban
and affluent, waste production has risen tenfold. By 2025 it will double again. Rubbish is
being generated faster than other environmental pollutants, including greenhouse gases.
Plastic clogs the world's oceans and rivers, causing flooding in developing-world cities.

Solid-waste management is one of the greatest costs to municipal budgets.

This rapid population growth aggravates the continuous increase in the volume of
solid waste generated per day. In Asia alone the waste generation rate is predicted to
increase from about 760,000 tons to about 1.8 million tons per day by 2025 (IBRD/WB
1999). The greater percentage of these wastes is not collected properly or is dumped
illegally. For example, in Mexico City, out of an estimated 10,000 tons of waste

generated per day, at least 25% is dumped illegally [1]. Based on the 1998 report of the
Japan International Corporation Agency (JICA), out of the 5,350 tons of waste generated

per day in Metro Manila, only about 75% is collected while the rest is dumped illegally

[2].

The worsening condition of solid waste creates environmental and health
problems. Garbage is “considered a third pollution inextricably interlocked with the air
and water pollution creating environmental hazards” (Small 1971 as cited in Ancheta
2005: 2). Improper disposal of solid wastes contribute air, soil, and water pollution. Solid
waste clogs drains, creates stagnant water for insect breeding, and causes floods during
rainy seasons especially in urban areas, Insect and rodent vectors can also spread diseases

such as cholera and dengue fever due to improper waste disposal [3].

Waste disposal and management is both an urban and rural problem. Every person
is a potential generator of waste and thus a contributor to this problem. To generate waste
is one thing, the type of waste generated is another and yet also the way the generated
waste is managed or disposed of is quite a different issue. Waste is generated by, and
from different sectors; domestic, commercial, industry and others and in many instances;
the waste management responsibility has been left to the government or administrative

authorities.

Research also shows that developing countries are more affected than developed
countries due to a lack of resources to purchase advanced and expensive technologies to

Support waste management activities,
from the people of the vicinity. The user will rate the garbage according to the given
measurements that has been provided. There should be at least 10 users to be sending the
same rate to treat it as a reliable source. After 24 hours, the data sent by the users will be
included in the generating of data and if the rate doesn’t meet the 10-user policy within
one day then the first few sent data shall be null and void and will be deleted in the
database for good. At the end of the day, the system will be able to generate report in

which shows the amount of garbage in a barangay.

"Planning and Designing Agroforestry System in Caraga Region
","Agroforestry is a land use management system in which trees or shrubs are grown around
or among crops or pastureland. It combines shrubs and tree in agricultural and forestry
technologies to create more diverse, productive, profitable, healthy, and sustainable land
use-system. The Land Capability Assessment and Mapping of an area is one of the
requirements to achieve best possible utilization of a farming land resource for sustainable
agricultural production. The productivity of the crops and trees corresponds to the bio-
physicals of the land and its sustainability and the technical skills and capabilities of the
farmer’s. However, the manual and normal process in assessing land capability and
locating its area suitability takes more time to do and is not easy for the land-use officials,
farmers and individuals. This study aims to develop an Automated Agroforestry System in
Caraga Region that will assist agricultural sectors in agricultural productions. The Land
Capability Assessment will ease the dissemination of information on the lands bio-physical
data and recommends crops that is suited to be planted in a specific area in Caraga Region.
The application of Information Technology helps in automating the system. With the use
of Xampp and PHP, data of the selected crop and forest tree species, with its corresponding
selected bio-physical characteristics such as altitude (elevation), soil type, temperature, and
rainfall requirements are manipulated for assessing land capability. And with the use of
Google Fusion, identifying crop suitability in a specific area can be easily located.
Furthermore, software reliability check has been conducted to know the accuracy of the

system.

Keywords: Xampp, PHP, Google Fusion
","Agroforestry has been defined as a dynamic ecologically based natural resources
management system that through the integration of trees on farms and in the agricultural
landscape diversifies and sustains production for increased social, economic and
environmental benefits for land users at all levels.

The “Planning and Designing Agroforestry System in Caraga Region” helps to
assist land-use Officials, researchers, farmers and individuals. Sustaining the development
of one sector is not easy especially the agricultural sector which is lacking on areas
concerning crops production because of different soil types, temperature,
altitude/elevation, slope and rainfall in most areas of the Caraga Region. This system helps
to maximize the benefits gained from applying agroforestry approaches to land
management for sustainable production of food and fuel to farmers. Agroforestry studies

promote land use in which woody perennials are grown on the same land as agricultural
tN

crops. The woody components interact ecologically and economically. The knowledge
base in this system utilizes annual rainfall, elevation/altitude, slope, soil type, and
temperature characteristics of a specific area. Soil information is one of the vital
components in the planning process, reflecting directly upon land use suitability. The utility
of soil-land-climate resource information for proper agricultural purposes is the basic data
to identify suitable land area for cultivating specific crops/trees. The design must be
centered on the land as its primary resource. The land evaluation system is based on land
qualities as related to the individual crops that is used to develop the crop requirements
based on experiments in the area. To identify the component species and technologies, they
should initially be validated for environmental adaptation.
As of today internet has become an important information source. The purpose of
this research is to explore the role of new and emerging technologies. As Agricultural
technology arises with great innovation, people/farmers tend to go beyond the line

","1.1 Background of the Study

Decision making is one of the most important activities in which school
administrators engage daily. The success of a school is critically linked to its effective
decisions [7]. It is a process of making a choice from a number of alternatives to achieve
a desired result [6]. For this reason, decision making is a time consuming activity where
the personnel observed rules and factors to achieve the desired goal.

The making of decisions is at the very center of the process of identifying
scholarship grantee. At the level of assessment and evaluation, the personnel will gather
the associated criteria or qualifications for each of the scholarship grant, which in turn,
determine how the selection would be done. This is where the main problem lies because

the number of prospective applicants may not be qualified for the scholarship grant and
the number of applicants may exceed the available capacity that results to the insufficient
budget for the current semester. With this, all the identified scholars are being ranked for

free stipend from the university from highest to least based on the given specification of

Student Scholarship and Financial Assistance Unit aims to establish systematic policies

and procedures governing student scholarship and financial assistance in the institute and
shall apply to both externally and internally-funded scholarship and financial assistance
programs [2].

An Automated Scholarships and Grants Identification is an automated system
used to aid the SSFAU of CSU in decision making for the scholarship applicants that
uses rule-based mode of knowledge representation. Through this medium, all the
qualifications of the scholarship grants has a corresponding weight in the system
responsible to determine the most qualified applicant based on the total weight gained
which will affect the scholar’s rank to avail the free stipend. The scholars and grants
identification and ranking of SSFAU is done manually which is time consuming from the
personnel and is prone to human errors especially in scholars’ ranking. As of first
semester S.Y 2015-2016, CSU has a total student population of 6,548. Out of these, in-
house scholars comprise 2% of the total population. As the administration, specifically

the CSU’s SSFAU giving its best to cater and to help students for their financial
assistance, had a hard time in selecting the most to least prioritized grants for the slots

apportioned by the SSFAU.
Rule-based expert systems have the ability to emulate the decision making ability

of human experts. They are designed to solve problems as humans do, by exploiting

encoded human knowledge or expertise. This knowledge can be extracted and acquired

directly through interaction with humans, as well as from printed and electronic resources

such as books, magazines and websites [3].
Hence, the system serves as a tool that aims to support the personnel to perform

their task more efficiently in a shorter span of time and to improve the system in

identifying the applicants who are well suited for the scholarship grant.

Expert system is one of the branches of artificial intelligence which serves as a
decision making system with human expertise. These particularly help in solving the
complex problems without the help of a human brain and used in many fields such as
healthcare, government sectors, educational services, survey tools, and agricultural
sectors. Expert systems are special computer programs which have the capability of

human reasoning, logical thinking and rules [1].

Rule-based is one of the types of expert system that mostly used industrial

artificial intelligence with simple rules. The rules can be easily updated. Once the expert
decisions are captured in the system in the form of rules, they are served and can be used
for a long time [2].
In some parts of Caraga Region where the advancement of technology is less

practiced and far from busy streets of the modernized area, people there rely their living

in agricultural sector including the corn industry sector.

Corn (Zea mays) as the second most important crop in the Philippines, assumes a
bigger role in the farming sector and the macro economy as a whole. It comprises about
70 percent of livestock mixed feeds in the country, and is the preferred main staple food
of about 12 million Filipinos. Corn production has become an important source of

livelihood for many small-scale for their subsistence [3].

About 60 percent of the Philippines’ annual corn production is from Mindanao,
and of this island's six main corn production areas, the Caraga Region has the lowest
average yield production. This is mainly attributed to low adoption of modem corn

production technologies and use of low-yielding traditional/ open-pollinated varieties by

the farmers [3].

With the development of a rule-based expert system for the automation on the
selection of corn variety in Caraga Region, it may help the corn breeders and farmers to
know some other corn varieties that are suitable for different location in the Caraga
Region. The researchers decided to implement the study for the betterment of the corn

breeders and farmers as they may ensure corn productivity and profitability.

","1.1 Background of the Study

Continuous expansion and development of societies all over the world are
undeniable since human relationship and activities also expand. The results of the
dynamism of the growing population give room for crime. These societies make every
effort to establish and develop institutions that can ensure peace as well as the security of

lives and properties of its citizenry.

Agusan del Sur is a large province composed of 14 municipalities with the land
area of 9989.52 km’. However, in spite of its large area and population, the province
lacks law enforcement facilities that disabled them from doing jobs effectively and
efficiently. For every municipality, there is only one police station and this situation
resulted in an unsafe environment for the community because of its wide area, police

station hard to identify where to deploy policemen.
A system should be designed that will help the police station to identify and map
crimes occurrence in the province using technologies such as Web development, GIS and

Geometric Sequence Method.

To address this problem, the Crime Mapping Using GIS: A Tool for Decision
Making In Agusan del Sur is given police officer to help to store crime records and
identify crime rate in every municipality. Mapping system will be used to determine
which municipality the crime happened and also for searching for crime records that had
been stored. Through this, it would be easy to search and identify the crime rate of the

","CHAPIBAN I. INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background of the Study

One of the greatest concern of the Philippines right now is the increasing rate of
crimes committed by some individuals in different arcas. Morcover, one way to achieve
Justice in every crime committed is to file a case against that individual who committed the
crime but not all victims are given the opportunity to file a case in court due to scarcity of
funds to finance the assessment of the incident if there was really a crime committed and
the whole process of the litigation, and the lack of knowledge on what would be the

appropriate type of case to file in that particular crime.

Based on the data from Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) surveyed last 2016,
there were 584, 733 [1] total cases of reported crimes. Some of these cases have been solved
with the help of attorneys and some are not. There are cases that have been solved in their
respective barangays or in their vicinity but not all in general. Some of the unsolved cases
on the barangay are depending on the person who raised the concern and some of those
persons have not had cnough knowledge on what to do next. Thus, the aggrieved individual
or person will seck the services of a lawyer/attorney-at-law to guide and assists them in

gathering and preserving evidence [2] and the subsequent filing of the case. They want to
know what would be the appropriate case of their concern and the appropriate attorneys-

at-law to reach. Clients who want to file the case are having a hard time on finding law

practitioner or the appropriate attorneys-at-law of their type of case. They need to have an
tN

attorney-at-law to focus on the case and to let them escalate the case to the higher level of
judgment. People/clients raise their concern first in Public Attorney’s Office as they are
offering free services/consultation whatever concerns they might have. However, clients
of the PAO are subject to the prescribed qualifications [3]. In addition, there are exemptions
for the persons to be qualified for assistance. Some clients sought the services of private
law practitioners for they want to have a quick action and assessment of their case but not
free of charge compared to that of the PAO. Some of those clients choose private law
practitioners because they want immediate action for the speedy filing of the case as private
practitioners have enough time to focus on the case with the corresponding professional
fee to be paid by the client.
Thus, this study aimed to develop a multiplatform application that will serve as a

tool for everyone who is in need of law practitioners. The usability of the system will serve
as a solution to everyone who wants to find appropriate attorneys-at-law and to have a

knowledge of legal matters and laws. The application will produce a recommendation list

of attorneys-at-law or firms regarding their concerns.

"ACT PLATFORM FOR AGRICULTURAL MARKET INTENSIFICATION:
A FARMER EMPOWERMENT OF CARAGA REGION
","iv

ABSTRACT

The ICT Platform for Agricultural Market Intensification is a system that can be

used on website. This secks to help the farmers around Caraga Region. In general, the
proponents have pointed out that there is a declination of agricultural value within the
region, no platform for the farmers to reach out the government agencies and investors in
order to apply for funding and inefficient strategy of the farmers in marketing agricultural
products. The system which entitled “ICT PLATFORM FOR AGRICULTURAL
MARKET INTENSIFICATION: A FARMERS EMPOWERMENT OF CARAGA
REGION” is to provide a web-based platform that will help the farmers to engage and be
updated with the current trainings, seminars and possible funding of the local government
agencies such as DTI — CARAGA and DA — CARAGA and to provide a web-based
platform for farmers and its buyers. Through this study the farmers of the region can
easily connect to their customers, the Department of Agriculture and Department of
Trade and Industry will easily identify number of registered farmers in the different
municipalities for training enlistments and funding. Lastly, buyers will have an easier

medium in buying the desired agricultural products.

Keywords: Agriculture, Farmer, Market, E-commerce
","1.1. Background and Rationale

Agriculture is the science or practice of farming, including cultivation of the soil
for the growing of crops and the rearing of animals to provide food, wool, and other
products.

In Caraga Region, agriculture is the most powerful sector which brings a 35.3%
employment rate, which implies that agricultural sector of Caraga Region is one of the
main source of its revenue [1].

CARAGA's economy in 2015 grew by 4.5 percent. It contributed 1.3 percent to
the country's Gross Domestic Product. Agriculture, Hunting, Forestry and Fishing Sector
accounted for 17.1 percent of the regional economy. It posted an 8.6 percent decrease in
2015 [1].

Caraga Region is a vast land where total of land area is about 2,112,056 hectares
that has 5 provinces, 6 cities, 67 municipalities and 1,311 barangays. Caraga Region has a
total population of 2,596,709 as of year 2015 [2].

Alarmingly, Caraga Region has a poverty rate of 30.8% as of year 2015. This is
due to its subsistence percentage about 12%. In addition, the prices of its commodities are
increasing for about 2.5% for all items. This 2.5% is the general average of all the items
listed in Figure 1 (See the Figure in page 2) which is the inflation rate per item for the last

2015 [1].

Figure 1. Inflation Rate by item, CARAGA 2015

The Figure 1 implicates that the commodities have increased. Therefore, as
inflation rate rises, every bill buys a smaller percentage of goods [1].
This might be one of the causes of high poverty rate in Caraga Region. A low

subsistence rate over a high inflation rate added by high poverty rate is not good for the

region.

tal employment was absorbed by the agriculture sector in 2015. Of those employed in

About 35.3 percent of the region's to
agriculture, 76 percent were male workers.

Figure 2. Employment and Wages

Figure 2 implies that the total employment is only half the total population of the

region. This factor has an impact to the increased poverty rate. Also, the pie chart shows
that the agriculture employment percentage from the region occupies 35.3% rating that
means Agricultural Employment in Caraga Region is one main of source of its income.

There was a study pointing out the problems of farmers groups that stresses the
lack of marketing skills of the farmers and lack of access to market. It stated that; it is
very difficult to manage and is costly in marketing of produce far from the cultivation.
Moreover, most of the groups or cooperatives usually do not have marketing skill. Also,
they are managed by someone from the members of a group who do not have any
knowledge on marketing and managing business as such. There are more market
opportunities if people can identify local market needs of the consumer and farmer can
easily make a profit from selling it [3].

The article above explicitly pointed out the gap between the farmers and the
consumers this is one of the reasons why products of farmers aren’t well endorsed in the
market.

The background study declares that over 35.3% of the employment is brought by
agriculture but because of the large amount of demand and low subsistence rate these
percentage does not do the trick at all. Moreover, an aggravation is also created by a
scarcity of supply against demand then followed by a bloating inflation rate of
commodities in which will going to be a burden for every person.

But, then there is an article entitled “US NGO wants CARAGA to showcase rich
resources"" By Rainier Allan Ronda (The Philippine Star) | Updated November 20, 2016
12:00am [4]. The article emphasize the Caraga Region should showcase its agricultural

productivity alongside its popularity as a mining and logging region.
Caraga Region is not just a leading producer of food for Metro Manila and other
urban centers of the country, it is also largely known for its riches in mineral ore and
industrial trees. The Caraga Region has been noted for mining and logging. No problem
has been found and it employs a lot of people. However, agriculture has been forgotten
[3].

Caraga Region which is composed of the provinces of Agusan del Norte, Agusan
del Sur, Surigao del Norte, Surigao del Sur, Dinagat Island, should be known as a food
basket of the country being the source of a number of food produce like banana. It is

banana basket of Manila but nobody knows about it, no promotion and no branding. The
agriculture has been forgotten [4]. Thus, promotion and empowerment of Agricultural
sector should be given drastic attention.

It may be that the resources for agriculture is already in here but only the support

and cultivation of agriculture by the local government is lacking. An article states that
“farmers and fishermen can be dependent and self-sufficient that can adapt to changing
environmental conditions. But this is less achievable without enough government
support, whether through capitalization, financial and technological resources, and even
land leasing for farming. Some forms of assistance can be fertilizers and seed supply, but
he hopes these will actually materialize [5].

Pertaining to the article of Karen Liao, the proponent’s thinks that in order to
promote and to empower the agricultural sector the foundation for it must also be
supported which is the famers. In the article the farmers were in desperate need of
support from the local government. Moreover, in the same article it also stated that the

lack of capital for the farmers makes it hard for them to move and cultivate the land even
though they have their own land but still the need for capital and support from the

government is badly needed.

Though he owns a small parcel of land, capital is needed for cultivation, and that
is something many of them don’t have. Without capital, for instance, it ends up
borrowing money for land cultivation or preparation. This leaves them with little after the
harvest, as they end up having to pay for the debt [5].

Aside from the need for funding and capital for farmers another factor arising is
that the need for trainings and seminars for the farmers. The same article indicated that
farmers nevertheless acknowledge the efforts of both government civil society groups in

holding regular agricultural training seminars and farmer field schools. Examples include
farmer field schools run by agencies like the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI),
PhilRice of the Department of Agriculture (DA) and also by some LGUs. Non-
governmental organizations also engage in some field schools and training programs for

farmers. Other projects involve distributing seed varieties.

Sectors in Agriculture), by Region

The Figure 3 is a result of a recent evaluation of registry system declares that
there are about 143,293 farmers that are registered in the Caraga Region [6]. However,
with the recently conducted Farmer’s Field School (FFS) on Cacao Production, only 153

farmers participated and completed from Butuan City and Cabadbaran City [7].
Therefore, out of 143,293 the farmers in the Caraga Region only few of them (153
from the cities of Butuan and Cabadbaran) have been chosen to join the training. That is
about 0.107% of registered farmers of the Caraga Region.

Summing up all the gathered data and background research; it reflects that the
support and information dissemination from the government agencies that could help in
empowering the farmers and empowering agricultural sector in the Caraga Region is
deficient. Evidences shown in Figures say that there are great numbers of farmers in
Caraga Region but there are only few of them availed such services.

After conducting a brief exploration and data inquiries about the profile of the
Caraga Region the researchers have emerge an idea of implementing a potential solution
to the current situation of the Caraga Region, which is to develop an application entitled
ICT PLATFORM FOR AGRICULTURAL MARKET INTENSIFICATION: A
FARMERS EMPOWERMENT OF CARAGA REGION.

This application will assist, mainly the farmers in promoting their products and
helping them to get involved with the current practices and proper trainings conducted by
the local government agencies such as DTI - CARAGA and DA - CARAGA. Moreover,
the application will also help the agency in disseminating their information about the
funding and trainings that they have for the local farmers of the Caraga Region. Lastly

the application will help to close the gap between the farmers and their potential clients.

WEB-BASED ENROLLMENT SYSTEM WITH SHORT MESSAGE SERVICE
","ABSTRACT

The Web-based Enrollment system with Short Message Service
(SMS) has been designed to enhance the current enrolment system that
could handle multiple enrollees for a short period of time and it would
enable the students to enroll through Internet and Cell phone. It means
that students need not to go personally to the campus just to get enrolled.
By using the said system, it can generate the enrollment process without
confronting themselves from the different offices.

Moreover, this would not only save resources for the administration, but

also save time and money for the students.
","CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

Public and private school face difficulties when managing student
enrollment due to increasing student number of students every year.
NORMISIST is one of the public school which faces those large students. It is
during enrolment, students have to go to get their enrolment papers and
processed, and some of the personnel would checked or validate student's
enrolment papers to ensure that student subjects are the ones they are
supposed to take based on their respective curriculum and subjects already
taken and passed. Since enrolment period is generally confined only in one or
two-weeks time, few hundred of students queue up in each office at the same
time in order to get enrolled. This is where the system begins to slow down and
lengthens waiting period for students.

On the other hand, an efficient enrollment system will not only save
resources for the administration, but also save time and money for the students.
As a result, it is very important upon every school administrator to have an
efficient enrollment system.

The current enrollment system of Northern Mindanao State Institute of
Science and Technology (NORMISIST) has the ability to handle enrollment but
unfortunately it is time consuming because the said system can only handle
students one at a time. Because of reason, researcher through the development

of rapid technology designed to adopt a web-based and SMS capability which
minimizes student queue with less effort during enrollment and enrollees

students to enroll via internet and sms, hence this study.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background of the Study

Communication is one of the most dominant and important activities in an
organization (IPR Organizational Communication Research Center, 2019). It is the
essence for the development of the organizations that helps the manager to perform the
primary functions of management like Planning, Organizing, Motivating and Controlling.
Communication documents stand as the foundation of every facet of a business. Thus, it
can be said that effective communication is the building block of an organization
(Senapati, 2016).

Nowadays, technology has largely influenced various systems that are used. Many
organizations have been making efforts on developing a system for saving people’s time,
efforts and providing convenience (Pandit, Nipane & Naik, 2016). Integration of a system
so-called Electronic File Tracking System which files are born digital thereby reduces the
use of paper in universitics, to the barest minimum possible. They are processed and
tracked online using the file number and the date created by the system in real-time
providing the location information geographically. Their system is known to be
interactive, usable and able to improve file management and productivity in university
administrative operations.

Caraga State University is an institution that consists of different offices, college

departments and more organizations that possibly sends any hard copy of communication
2

~

documents to a specific organization for important purposes. For instance, a letter should
be signed by specific individuals such as chairperson, dean of a college and department,
to make it reliable and accepted to the personal address in the communication document.
The offices within CSU institution has the traditional way of processing document which
is manually logged, receive, sign and forward communication documents. The issues
found that indeed happened in the offices were time-consuming and found it tedious in
taking an action before it processes communication document. Assumed, that the
personal address in the document could be on another workloads or transaction which
another document will be placed on its desk. The offices are unaware and unable to
recognize the pending and newly communication documents received. Moreover, missing
of the document is indeed frequently happened and common issue upon forwarding to the
wrong office that resulted to hassle the sender for creating another communication
document again and re-sign the paper to the signatories.

The issues encountered at Caraga State University’s offices are worth solving for
the reason that the manual process cause difficulties and affect others. It is tedious when
it comes to proving actions as a response and there may be a fail or delayed the
transaction. In addition, workflows within the office do require movement of documents
across facilities and tracking such critical files and documents is one of the greatest
problems in offices today (EMITAC Enterprise Solution, 2019).

Therefore, a web-based platform system intended to solute the problems
encountered and give convenience to every office in dealing with massive documents
must be developed. The system reads a QR code from document and automates its route

which receiver and signees will be aware of every communication documents received.
3
By reading a QR code is serves as routing of e-documents with the integration of push

notification within the system that keep them updated. The E-communication Monitoring
and Notification System will serve as a solution in monitoring and direct the flow of
documents. So that, the college and administrative offices will always be updated,
monitored and through the system it would able to identify whose offices is efficient and

active in taking an action to the response by approving or signing a communication

document.

University services are significant factors in providing the overall experience and
preparation of the students in their college life. Student services covered a wide range of
services in the institutions all of these support services help to enhance the overall student
experience and are offered to give opportunity to every student to discover their selves as
well as their personality. For its purpose is to assure the growth and development of
students with regards to their academic involvement. However, in terms of availing the
services offered in the two offices - OSAS-Guidance, were found to be very low
according to secondary data that gathered by the researchers. The aim of this study is to
design a workflow that will thoroughly help the students and office personnel in making
the workflow run smoothly and without any hassles. To design a Caraga State University

aspects of the analysis provide avenues to reduce the occurrence of errors in the system,
which make improvements. Designing a prototype is one of the outputs of this research
with the help of the diagrams as a backbone of developing a system in the future. By the
help of this system workflow the students who availed the services will independent to

module has a big impact to students that they’re can update efficiently and fasten the
important services that offered in the institution.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background of the Study

Student services cover a very wide range of services including, but are not limited
to: athletics, student government, counseling, clubs and organizations, fraternity and
sorority life, student leadership, and spiritual life (E.Lizotte 2015). According to A.
Ciobanu (2013), a university must provide the best service to its students, especially
when the same services are also given by others to avoid student to transfer. All of these
support services help to enhance the overall student experience and are offered to give
opportunity to every student to discover theirselves as well as their personality. For its

purpose is to assure the growth and development of students with regards to their

academic involvement.

Caraga State University Counseling and Testing Center, aims to (1) Improve the
student’s self-knowledge or understanding of their respective interests, needs, abilities,
personal adjustments, and personality traits; (2) Assist students in understanding
themselves and others, making decisions, solving behavioral problems and improving
their relationships with themselves and with their peers; and (3) provide students
information of available opportunities and the techniques essential for wise educational
and vocational courses. The Office of Students Affairs and Services (OSAS) of Caraga
State University also aims to implement the guidelines, rules and regulation in

coordinating, monitoring and reporting of the activities on the various general services
2
programs of the university which leads to the awareness of the students with the services

offered and can be availed by them.

Nowadays, it has been a big problem to the institution for the reason that the
spreading of the information about the said services offered both in the Guidance Office
and OSAS is not that widely extended towards the students. The students must be

encouraged to avail the said services offered for it is their right to avail and have the

benefits that can be enjoyed from it.

For a clearer proof that not all of the students were able to avail the services being
offered, the researchers have gathered secondary data from the Guidance office and
shows that the number of enrollees from different colleges of Caraga State University for
the 1 and 2"" semester A.Y 2017 — 2018 have reached to 4734 and 4550 respectively.
For the different services under Psychological Test and Counseling, the total number of
students from the different colleges who availed the said services is approximately 461
(10%) and 267 (6%) of the total number of students enrolled respectively for the 1° and
2™ semester A.Y 2017 — 2018. Based on the number of examinees who were able to avail
the services offered, it only means that improvement must be commended for the said
office because comparing the number of students who availed the services to the total

number of students that are enrolled during A.Y 2017-2018 is having a difference and

problem.

For the services offered by the OSAS, the researchers focused only on the
following that are beneficial to the students: the Processing Scholarship and Financial

Aid, in which its focus is to ensure that eligible students can avail the scholarship
3

program; Dormitory Management, its focus to ensure that all dormitory applications are
processed efficiently, Administering Medical and Dental Services wherein its emphasis
is to provide programs and information that can help the students improve their personal
health being, and Processing complaints to ensure that all complaints received against
students are processed timely. Most of these services are availed by some students but
not all of the students are aware that they can actually have and enjoy these services

offered by the OSAS. The awareness of such services has always been a problem for

some of the students.

According to Lumen Research Center in Social and Humanistic Sciences, to be
effective, the student services require integrated solutions with three major components:
e

Strategies based on executive vision, commitment, planning, and performance.

Redesigned processes focused on students and parents in the role of customers
served by the university employees.

e Efficient use of tools.

This only means that in having an effective student services it must satisfy the
students’ needs with regards to the benefits they can get throughout availing those
services offered by an institution. Aside for its effectiveness, the use of the said tools or

services must be efficient for the students as well as to the parents of the students.

The researchers would designed a Caraga State University Student Services
Workflow that will help the students to be aware of the services provided by the

university. This workflow will also help the Guidance and OSAS in providing

information for the students that will be more efficient and effective.

Generally, banks cannot live by deposits alone, that is why money derived from deposits is used
by way of loans to generate more income. Hence, it is the bread and butter of the bank.

The Bank provides credit facilities to various clients depending on the need and
appropriateness to the project financed. Any entity e.g. Small Medium Enterprise, corporation,
local goverment units (LGUs), and cooperatives, may apply for a loan as long as its eligibility is
established. They have to pass certain requirements in accordance to bank policies.

Accounts can be marketed. Sometimes, a walk-in client comes along and applies for a
loan. An account officer, one who initially determines the eligibility of a client and packages
accounts, may choose to accept or decline loan applications. Approval of loans may take a while.
A credit investigation is conducted first, collateral/s are then appraised to determine how much
amount of loan exposure the bank is allowed to provide. Certain conditions are satisfied first
before loan approval is done. Otherwise, justifications must be prepared. The Loan Approving
Group is the one responsible for the approval of the loan. The procedure is tough, that is why at
stage one, it is important to package quality accounts in order to minimize problems in the future.

Once the loan is approved, monitoring comes in. A quality loan coupled with good
monitoring system makes life easier for the bank. Basically, this project aims to help the internal
user to immediately access client information without having to go to the manual measure of
flipping pages of files, or having to ask someone else for help in order to get the needed data.

Because of data that is readily available, reporting saves time and effort.

The lack of automation for the entrepreneurial competency identifier examination of the
Department of Trade and Industry leads to slow and difficult improvement in the process
of administering the examination. In order to comply this deficiency, this study illustrates
the development of an expert system that utilizes the data from the examination, one which
automatically uses the formula provided in order to give results to the user. The system
also stores the result of the exam into a database which can only be accessed by authorized
personnel. JavaScript was used in order to generate visualizations for the system, including
the chart of the result. Moreover, XAMPP server was used for data storage and application
for Twitter Bootstrap front-end framework was utilized for the graphical user interface of
the system. It was observed that the designed system functioned very effectively as
evidenced by the result when the system testing was conducted.

","1.1 Background of the Study

Students are turning their talent into a way of making a living whilst experienced
professionals are opting for the freedom and flexibility that comes with self-employment.
Mums are spotting gaps in the market and the over 50’s are surging ahead when it comes
to launching new ventures. No matter your age or standing, there is potential to turn a
passion or skill from your professional or social life into a bright business idea. And by
doing so embracing free and low-cost technology that enables you to sell to local markets
and reach customers on a global scale [1].

Small businesses are the lifeblood of our national and state economy. The
entrepreneurial spirit that propels people to create and grow new businesses has been an
essential part of our growth as a state. In fact, small businesses account for the majority

of net new job creation in the country.
While owning a business may be a personal dream for many, managing a business
may prove difficult because of a lack of prior business ownership, experience or
management skills. An honest self-evaluation will allow you to assess your personal
characteristics and determine your willingness to meet the demands of owning your own
business [2].

There are standard predefined questions to personal characteristics to assess if one
is ready to engage into business or not, however, it is critical to evaluate your personal
weaknesses along with your strengths.

However, when owner weaknesses are identified, partners, managers, staff
members, other external resources or education and training may be found to balance
strengths and offset weaknesses [3].

In the Philippines, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) is the primary
coordinative, promotive, facilitative, and regulatory arm of the Philippine Government
with the country’s trade, industry, and investment activities. The DTI is responsible for
realizing the country's goal of globally competitive and innovative industry and services
sector that contribute to inclusive growth and employment generation.

To achieve its goals, the government firm needs to expand exports, increase
investments, develop and promote Micro Small, Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), and
enhance consumer welfare and protection [4]. Along with this, is the initiative to assist
potential business starter in choosing the appropriate business structure based on their
target attributes. Standard requirements are also collected which includes permit, BIR
Certificates and other pertinent documents to facilitate business naming and registration

to the Philippines Business Registry.
lod

The year 2011 and 2012 marked a record high for doing over 450,000 people set
up a company and became their own boss [1]. This habitual transaction of the firm
consumes a lot of time, which includes the identification of structure base on the owner's
criteria for opening a business.

The role of IT in shaping tomorrow’s business operations is a distinctive one. LT.
has become a fundamental enabler in creating and maintaining a flexible business
network [5]. Though, most national government offices have automated their clerical
functions using word processing and spreadsheets.

But while there are a number of transaction processing systems in key
government agencies, these systems have limited scope and functionality, are seldom
integrated with related systems in other government agencies, and in general, fail to
provide timely and accurate decision-making support.

Moreover, the actual level of ICT usage or the number of applications in use vary
across agencies. There is also limited usage of administrative systems and even more
limited usage of executive management systems.

To this end, the researchers had designed and developed a system that will
automate the entrepreneur identifier examination as per recommendation of the DTI-
ADN. The system aims to use the technology available in order to provide assistance to
individuals who are interested in the world of business. The system is one that can
balance concerns and issues regarding different areas of the entrepreneurship and give

information about the different areas concerning entrepreneurial abilities according to the

data which is inputted by the user.

In lieu of this, using technology in order to help the institution cope up with the
changing world will lead to advancing views in terms of taking advantage of the available

","ABSTRACT

The purpose of this study was to design and implement computer-based training
material on Open Office.org Writer .Another aim was to compare computer-based
training (through the creation of a multimedia presentation) and the traditional teaching
technique. The researches would also like to determine if there exist a relationship
between student’s sex and their intellectual capability. Finally, determine the usability of
Multimedia Presentation on Open Office.org Writer among selected 4"" year high school
students in Butuan City.

The multimedia presentation (video tutorial) contains and demonstrates the basic
instruction on how to use the Open Office.org Writer by just clicking on a link provided
by the html page, topics in each lessons is provided with videos for the users to have a
quick review for some topics in which they found difficult, and because it is in an html
page only, the user do not need an internet connection or installations to learn this word
application, as long as the user has a web browser he/she can use this multimedia
presentation.

Systematic Random Sampling was the statistical method used to avoid bias in
identifying the respondents of the study. Slovin’s formula was utilized to identify
the sample size. Questionnaires were administered on two high schools (Caraga State
University (CSU) and Butuan City School of Arts (BCSAT) and Trades in Butuan City.
The self-made questionnaires were consisted of pre-test and post-test for both groups
(Traditional Teaching Method (TTM) and Computer-Based Teaching Method (CBTM))

and an evaluation questionnaire exclusive only for CBTM setup.
The results with respect to the school (CSU and BCSAT) showed that when
comparing the resulting mean of the post-test exam of the CBTM from both schools is
higher than the resulting mean of the TTM. It also gained a qualitative interpretation
which is equal to Very Satisfactory. From these results, the researchers can conclude that
the Computer-Based Training Method is usable and can substitute the Traditional

Teaching Method.
","Chapter 1

INTRODUCTION

Traditional teaching is a teacher centered approach in which students attend the
lecture, listen, and take down notes. Students after the lecture will then review their notes
and recall the information. With this kind of teaching-learning environment, students
cannot completely understand the basic concepts, particularly given the lack of active
participation. This approach may not provide students with valuable skills or even with a
body of knowledge that lasts much beyond the end of the term [2]. Also, using this
approach makes the students get tired and impatient who later on resorts on doing
something else instead of listening to the teacher.

Computer-based learning is increasingly used to enhance learning. Because of
which, the researchers give rise to a multimedia presentation with Open Office.org Writer
as its package as a part of the pursuit to induce learning about open source software to
high school students. Multimedia presentation software is known for incorporating
sound, animation effects and cinematic-like special effects into presentations. It is a tool
that computer users of varying industries and backgrounds use to dynamically present
information to an audience. It differs from standard presentation software in its features
and its interactivity potential. Through this, they will no longer imagine what the
application does and how to use it because by just listening and looking at the structured
presentation, one can already get the idea [2].

However, reports suggest that more educational research should be performed to

find out how usable computer-based learning (CBL) really is (Campbell and Johnson,
1999). The researchers propose to measure the Usability of Multimedia Presentation in
Open Office Writer.org. Relative to this, the study attempts to compare the two teaching
methods (traditional and the computer-based) to selected 4™ year secondary students in
Butuan City and determine the factors affecting the usability of the said computer-based

","1.1 Background of the Study

The educational system in the Philippines is undergoing a big change which most
academicians deteriorating quality of education in the country. Almost all of the countries
in the world are having k-12 as their basic education program. Naturally, the known
definition of k-12 is a 13-year education program from kindergarten until senior high
school. Recently, it has been proposed to be used. By changing the curriculum, students
will surely have a higher standard of education. DepEd proposed this program to enhance
the learning capabilities of the students. Students need time for them to properly understand
a lesson. K-12 provides students to have more time to properly understand the lessons, not

just cramming them for a latter exam and forgetting them when the exam are over. [20]

The rapid change on educational system is a burden for the teachers and students
to adapt. It takes time for the both part to be really comfortable in this kind of changes.

Yet, k-12 gives a big advantage for educational aspects but assessing the students on how
N

they cope to this new approach is an issue. Since the DepEd implemented this new
curriculum, the evaluation for the students should be fit for this kind of innovation. The

traditional assessment and review using the pen and paper is an old one which should be

develop.

In the model of critical thinking and practical inquiry proposed by Garrison and his
colleagues, three overlapping lenses—cognitive presence, social presence, and teaching
presence—provide mutual support to create a framework in which interaction in an
asynchronous online educational experience may be assessed. In the learning of the learner,
the review and the assessment of the students are essential steps for their holistic

development. The process of learning involves reviewing of the topic before taking the

assessment in order for the students to have a better understanding.

Review is to look over, study, or examine again. The students should have a review
to be able to refresh their knowledge towards a certain topic. This will remind the students
of what they know and give them the framework that they need to incorporate the new

information. The traditional way of reviewing is to scan the book of the notes of the

students for them to know their previous topics [23].

Teaching means teacher is doing the act of teaching. Learning means students are
doing the act of learning. A teacher’s mission is not to dispense knowledge; rather it is to

facilitate learning. A way to facilitate learning is the assessment [19}.

Assessing the levels of learning of every students is one way for the teacher to
evaluate how far their performance have improve [11]. The examination which is one of

the type of assessment is a test not just for the person who gives the exams but also a big
2

test for the management and teacher who arranges the exams. This assessment can be done
mostly through written examination which the learners take using paper and pen inside the
classroom. It is the typical scenery that anyone can be seen in old times. The students will
wait for how many days to get the results because it takes time for the teacher to check all

the examination paper.

According to Claire Ellicot, it is why for generations, hundreds of thousands of
learners have spent the end of the school year in gymnasiums scrawling answers to the
sound of the ticking clock. And every summer they have endured a nerve-wracking two-
month wait for their results. The traditional written examination is time consuming for
every student and teacher. Leakage, cheating and also human errors in checking for this
manually kind of exam is very rampant. The result might not be an accurate enough to

determine the level of learning of the students [6].

In the journey of innovation, it have been seeing amazing and fast changes in the
daily chores of the people because of technological development that serves as a catalyst
for this evolution. Technology made life easier, faster and modern. Even educational
system also adopt to this modification. It is time of technology crunch; different approaches

and smart techniques are being applied in all level of educational institutions [1].

The solution for secure, convenient and scalable exam integrity whenever or
wherever exams are administered — with different robust security models for variable kinds
of computer — based exam. Online learning (Asynchronous), which also involve in review
and examination—for students and for teachers is one of the fastest growing trends in

educational uses of technology.
As such, the researchers would like to create “An Automated Review Materials and
Test Banking: Computer Aided Instruction (CAI)’, a system that will innovate the method
of teaching-learning. It is an online-based examination that does not only evaluate the
students’ level of learning but also it teaches the student to learn something in a specific
subject in K-12 field through the reviewer materials. It removes most the drawback that

was in the traditional method.

Introduction, Background and Rationale

Computer games are one of the most rapidly grooving areas since computers start
to take place in our life. Today, games contain high multimedia content and most
importantly have the ability to be played over network and internet, offline or online by
many people at the same time [1].

On the other hand, attention to education is due in an extensive sense, since
education is the basic and common foundation unto which to build in order to strengthen
the power of citizens and institutions. Development of new methods for teaching and
learning is necessary to accelerate learning, develop new skills for the knowledge of
economy, to reach new learner groups currently unreached by conventional techniques of
learning and to facilitate development of new knowledge, mainly in scientific fields,

where the competition is harder and more critical. One relatively new method is game-

based learning [2].

Game-based learning has been defined as “the use of computer game-based

approach to deliver, support, and enhance teaching, learning, assessment, and evaluation”
[13]. This is a research area that may be abstracted as the node of learning concept,
computer games model and design, user interfaces, and subject matter expertise. During
the past few years there has been a significant amount of work carried out into the use of
computer game-based technologies and concepts to enhance teaching and learning, both
for education and training purposes. In this conceptualization, learning theory serves as

the foundation to ensure that technology does not become the dominant factor.

As viewed therefrom, Game based learning (GBL) is a type of game play that has
defined learning outcomes. Generally, game based learning is designed to balance subject
matter with gameplay and the ability of the player to retain and apply said subject matter
to the real world. It also describes an approach to teaching, where students explore
relevant aspect of games in a learning context designed by teachers. Teachers and
students collaborate in order to add depth and perspective to the experience of playing the
game. Good game-based learning applications can draw us into virtual environments that

look and feel familiar, and relevant.

More so, integrated learning is a pedagogical design that integrates a rich set of
instruction, learning and technological components. It is the integration of different
pedagogical strategies, including individual, group and class work - an integration of
direct teaching, presentable learning activities and distance work. It is also the integration

of theoretical and practical knowledge and the use of different technologies.

In other words, game-based learning, the transfer of knowledge through

“gameplay”, meaning some type of competition in which users attempt to outperform
others or challenge themselves. It includes a reward-and-penalty system that works 25 2

form of assessment. Game-based learning products have specified pedzgoeical gca's.

Basically, not only does the integration of learning with gaming mzke the suaject
more fun and interesting, it also motivates students to learn, immerses them in
material so they learn more effectively, and encourages them to learn from their mistzkes.
It is one of the many fundamental aspects of game-based integrated learning. In addition
a quick assessment from playing the game are given in order for that individual to take
notice of how he/she is doing in that particular subject or how deep and/or shallow his
understanding and knowledge from that particular topic is. Presently, there are at least 5
types of assessment namely, formative assessment (e.g. on-the-spot, interactive class
discussion), interim assessment (e.g. chapter test), and summative assessment (e.g. major

exams, periodical exams).

Effective learning, efficient acquisition of new skills and knowledge and overall
and personal development have become key factors in today’s global competition.
Besides, developing methodologies and tools to achieve such target is a clear need
particularly for countries that aim to have a knowledge-based economy and society [13].
With the high increase in popularity of computer games, the idea of using games as an
instrument in education became more important. Successful implementations of using
computer games in educations became real when high concentration supplied by
computer games come together with competition environment among students. With a
view to the said subject matter, this study proposes to create another effective tool for an
effective learning and efficient educational outcomes through the game-based learning

application— an interactive type of game.

"Computer Assisted Syllabi and TOS Making Environment for HEI Teachers
","Abstract

Syllabus making is made to provide students with information about the form and content
of a course. It provides a view into the instructor's plans for content to be covered
throughout the course, methods of learning anticipated, and schedule for accomplishing the
different steps and learning tasks, culminating in a final exam or project. Several studies
have shown that questions of content and conceptual understanding are troublesome in
making an outcomes-based education aligned syllabus. This has resulted in the recognition
that teachers require greater guidance and support in content specification. With this
Computer Assisted Syllabi and TOS Making Environment for HEI Teachers, this aims to
address the difficulties acquired on making an OBE aligned syllabus. The system assist
instructors in making their OBE aligned syllabus and table of specification (TOS). The
instructor input a topic and chose what cognitive domain category it belongs (Creating,
Evaluating, Analyzing, Applying, Understanding and Remembering). The system will
suggest appropriate verbs from the Blooms Taxonomy based on the topic inputted and
category the instructor has selected. The system also automate the TOS making, the
Instructor inputs the topics that will be given the desired hours rendered in the topic,
percentage and points for its learning objectives based on the blooms taxonomy cognitive
domain category and based on the inputted hours, points and percentage the system will
automatically calculate the total hours, points and percentage. The system is web-base. It
was being made using HTMLS5, Angularjs and Bootstrap as front-end and PHP5 and
PostgreSQL as backend. The proposed system will be able to increase productivity,
improve the efficiency of learning process and will significantly add to the effort in a
massive curriculum development.
","Background of the Study

Higher education course documentation in the Philippines has traditionally been
done in terms of syllabi describing what is to be taught. However, what some teachers
taught and what their students actually need to learn are often quite different. It is one
reason why there is a need to specify what successful graduates should be expected to know
or be able to do, ie. the learning outcomes. For in the new trend on institutional
accountability, the quality and improved performances of higher education institutions are
most of the times insisted and not just expected.

The changing realities spurred by globalization underscore the shift in
contemporary international education discourse from education to lifelong learning, and

from education as transmission of expert knowledge to education as building learner

competencies — including learning how to learn 241
i)

What this means is that the competitive advantage of Philippine HEIs and in many
cases, their survival is premised on their ability to offer quality degree programs that meet
international standards and produce graduates with lifelong learning competencies. HEIs
are therefore expected to develop “human resources with various types of knowledge,
competencies, and expertise, especially in support of the social, economic, and
development needs of the Philippine” 5)

As such, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) supports the development

of HEIs into mature institutions by engaging them in the process of promoting a culture of
quality. Premised on a shared understanding of quality, CHED encourages institutional
flexibility of HEIs in translating policies into programs and systems that lead to quality
outcomes, assessed and enhanced within their respective internal quality assurance (QA)
system 16),
CHED’s definition of outcomes-based education: it is an approach that focuses and
organizes the educational system around what is essential for all learners to know, value,
and be able to do to achieve the desired level of competence. Thus, this kind of teaching-
learning system will have its appropriate assessment of student performance.

Lately, a new trend in educational assessment has been observed as more academic
institutions are moving away from the traditional curriculum-based assessment models
towards outcomes-based ones 'II°). Few factors have contributed to this new trend
including some recent studies, which show that even students enrolled in respected
academic institutions often fail to exhibit fundamental understanding of basic concepts and
fairly easy physical systems '!, This is mainly because curriculum-based models do not

usually make clear statements as to what students are expected to achieve upon completing
a program of study. Having a carefully designed curriculum and a highly qualified faculty
do not necessary mean that students comprehend the offered material. Therefore, to
improve the efficiency of learning processes, academic institutions are increasingly
adopting outcomes-based approaches for curriculum design ©!. This shift makes them focus
more on assessing the expected outcomes of the educational experience rather than the
quality of the offered curriculum.

Developed in the 1980’s and ‘90’s, the concept of outcome-based education is most
commonly associated with William Spady '""J°!_ Qutcome-Based Education (OBE) means
clearly focusing and organizing everything in an educational system around what is
essential for all students to be able to do successfully at the end of their learning
experiences. This means starting with a clear picture of what is important for students to
be able to do, then organizing the curriculum, instruction, and assessment to make sure this
learning ultimately happens. Outcome-based education is designed so that all students are
equipped with the knowledge, skills and qualities needed to be successful after they exit
the educational system ""1! For Spady, he describes learning outcomes as Clear learning
results that we want students to demonstrate at the end of significant learning experiences.
While exit outcomes represent the culmination of a student’s career, enabling outcomes

provide the key building blocks upon which these are developed. Once the exit outcomes
have been identified, curriculum, instructional strategies, assessment and performance
standards are organized to ensure that students are able to achieve them ""1.

In preparing for OBE implementation, the curriculum need to be revised, and also
the Program Educational Objectives (PEOs) as well as the Program outcomes (PQs) are to

be defined. Traditional education approaches based on direct instruction of facts and
standard methods have not emphasized on soft skills needed in jobs e.g. communication
skills, interpersonal skills, analytical skills, working attitude etc. On contrary, the basic
tenets of Outcomes-based education (OBE) are described as being about shifting the focus
of educational activity from “teaching to learning; skills to thinking; content to process:
and teacher instruction to student demonstration” !71,
The normal operation for an academic programme is to further map the courses LO
to the PO (Programme Outcomes) in order to observe the accumulative sum of LO
contributing to the achievement of PO. The concept of OBE also does not provide for any
specific procedure or follow a single idea in achieving the outcomes which led to confusion
to how best implement an OBE curriculum J, The original concept of OBE should include
the cyclic continual improvement with meaningful revision of teaching and learning
pedagogies, delivery and assessment methods. The confusion is also extended during the
construction of learning outcomes for a particular course. In traditional learning, the
outcomes are mostly labelled as learning objectives which encourages the construction of
LO being direct translation of course contents objectives !71,
To support the faculty members in shifting from traditional way of instruction to
OBE, the researchers propose to develop system that assist instructors in making their OBE
aligned syllabus and table of specification (TOS). The system will be able to increase
productivity, improve the efficiency of learning process and will significantly add to the
effort in a massive curriculum development. This effort as described, includes the
redesigning from exit outcomes to specific lesson outcomes. To help alleviate some of the
stress in syllabi and TOS creation, the proposed software environment can suggest the

appropriate terms on making the outcomes and assist in designing the curriculum.
The system will be developed using Open Source software including Apache,

PostgreSQL, PHP and other web-based technologies.

made based on their quantity and quality. Inventories count the tree population and, in

many cases, the sites available for tree planting. Historically, inventory media included

index cards, ledger books, and paper maps, which made searching, manipulation and

analysis difficult. Most inventories now are electronic, greatly facilitating these tasks.

Similarly, field data collection is now commonly carried out on handheld electronic

devices [1].

Caraga State University is a Higher Education Institution that focuses on

environmental and Agricultural Studies. In the College of Agricultural Sciences and
Natural Resources (CASNR) and College of Arts and Sciences (CAS), especially the
foresters and the environmentalist are focusing in the study of the trees. The university
have no records of trees and they do not inventory the trees inside the campus. The tree
inventory is one way to maintain the green environment and to update the trees that still
exist inside the campus. Inventorying trees can guide the students, faculty members and
the university about the trees population, location and information inside the campus. For
the future needs of the university and the incoming students who would like to take
courses about trees and environment, campus tree inventory can maintain and balance the
population of trees.
Tree Inventory system in Caraga State University is accessible through browser.

This system provides a flexible data management that can allow the admin to add and

share some data they have. Openlayers map is one of the helpful tool that has been using

for this system for locating trees inside the university.

"Using Geospatial Technologies in Housing Suitability
Identification in Butuan City
","CeU LIBRA Y
Abstract AMPAYON, BUTUAN CIT*

This study illustrated a way of integrating Open-Source Geographical Information System (GIS)
and Leaflet Application Programming Interface (API) Technology for developing an automated
system on Housing Suitability Identification in Butuan City. The nonexistence of a centralized
system that generates and analyzed geospatial data in Butuan City leads to a difficult way of
identifying housing suitability. The researchers create a web based system which aid in land
selection on building a house. Geospatial data and relevant information such as flood prone area,
fault line, built-up areas, and proximity distance from road were combined to create a
summarized data of suitability map. And by the used of model in ArcMap application the
researchers can create and manipulate data sets to include a variety of information to the map.
The ArcMap made it possible for managing geographic information in a database and used for
the analyzation of different factors. The conceptual framework that this study used, helps to do
the multi analysis more simplier, particularly in resources allocation and land suitability with the
help of GIS-based MCA (Multi-Criteria Analysis) model, and used to generate the final result of
the map. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the web-based system was created and

programmed in HTML, CSS and JavaScript language.
","1.1 Background of the Study

Urbanization is a continuous process and it results in attracting people to urban

areas for better living. As a result demand for residential land is prominent in the

surroundings of cities and urban sprawl is a common phenomenon that exists in most

developed and developing countries. Therefore cities face with the most challengeable

task of providing Jand with better infrastructure to fulfill this demand. In this case,

situation of developing countries are more aggravated due to the lack of proper planning
regulations.

Urban development and migration of population from rural to urban areas are

global phenomena. Any small and isolated population centers are rapidly changing into

large metropolitan cities and hence the conversion of natural land to urban use is quite

obvious [1]. The rapid increase of urban population and the transforming urban economy
lead to an ever-increasing load on the urban environment in terms of urban capture
structure of the cities, creating many problems, such as unplanned and inadequate
development, traffic congestion, increase risk to people living in the area, sewerage
facilities and lack of other amenities [2].

Butuan as a highly urbanized city has a total land area of 817.28 sq. km or 81,728
hectares (Has) consists of 42,566 Has in agricultural, 26,800 Has in forestland, 1,896.43
Has in residential, 157.24 Has in commercial, 56.57 Has in industrial, 175.34 Has in
institutional, 947.05 Has in park/open spaces and 5,305.68 Has for other uses. With the
growing population of Butuan, there are 309,709 total number of population by the actual
National Statistics Office survey in the year 2010. The record shows that the actual
growth rate of the city is 1.48 from 2000-2010 [27].

Geographic Information System (GIS) is a powerful tool that can be used to
analyze spatial data and its sophisticated analysis functionalities with multi criteria
evaluation provide a better approach for suitability analysis. This research aims to do a
suitability analysis to identify possible locations for residential development in Butuan
City. GIS tools play a major role in various infrastructure developments. Several
decisions taken by different planning agencies require spatial analysis of maps involving
many parameters. The GIS based maps provide the most important source for spatial
analysis.

Land suitability analysis is the process of determining the fitness of a given tract
of land for a define use [3]. In other words, it is the process to determine whether the land
resource is suitable for some specific uses and to determine the suitability level.

Geospatial technology refers to equipment used in visualization, measurement, and
analysis of earth’s features, typically involving such systems as GPS (Global Positioning
Systems), GIS and RS (remote sensing). Its use is well-known and widespread in the
military and in homeland security, but its influence is pervasive everywhere, even in
areas with a lower public profile, such as land use, flood plain mapping and
environmental protection [28].

In the application of site suitability analysis, the researchers introduced the study,
“Using Geospatial Technology in Housing Suitability Identification in Butuan City”. It
will generate a map that will provide spatial information to CHDO and in individuals
specially to investors in Butuan City with regards of sites suitable for housing based on

built-up areas, erosion, flood prone areas, fault line and roads proximity.

ABSTRACT

The study is about the Unified Advisory Platform on Service Interruption in
Butuan City. The Unified Advisory Platform on Service Interruption is designed to aid
the awareness of all registered consumers of every service providers about its service
interruption schedules. The objectives of the study are to create a platform for early
advisory on service interruption that able to reach all consumers through SMS and to
create an interface that aggregates consumers’ data.

The proponents constructed the different functionalities of the system. The
developers chose the agile model for the development planned. The System Development
Life Cycle (SDLC) agile method is use in development for planning, analyzation,
designing, development and implementation of this study.

The study was successfully made according to the planned methods and
development process. However, the developers would like to propose the following
recommendations: add feature in the application that the consumer can reply
confirmation about the advisory they received; the advisory can send to the email
addresses registered in the consumer’s information; and the system will automatically

send the advisory based on the scheduled time to be sent.

","CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background of the Study

The dissemination of accurate and unbiased information constitutes an important
new undertaking. Information dissemination plays an important role in communicating
to the general public for the things like meetings, projects, activities, events, services and
others that would be happening. Nowadays, the major media for information
dissemination utilized included posters, local newspapers, local radio, social media, and
the before mentioned public meetings. It involved one-time publication in newspapers
and was broadcasted on local radio stations over a few days. Service providers like
organizations, governments, managements, and a lot of groups in the world use the
content and means of information dissemination [1].

Service Providers attaches great importance to communicating with its
stakeholders, the public and the media. Every service provider in the country especially
government agencies has different and unique mandate in providing appropriate
information to the general public. They aim to provide information to the public in a
timely manner, outlining the development of any incident including the situation. They
must work quickly and efficiently to provide the public with information as up-to-date as
possible.

The Philippine Information Agency (PIA) is the government agency that has a
mandate in providing all the internal and external consumers with timely, accurate and

relevant information that contributes to proactive citizenship, national progress, and
2

better quality of life for all Filipinos. The core service includes information gathering,

production and dissemination. PIA directly serves the presidency and the executive
branch on the national, regional, and provincial levels through sixteen (16) regional
offices and seventy-one (71) provincial information centers [2]. Currently, the PIA
branch in Butuan City use text plus-SMS in disseminating information. They acquire
consumers’ phones numbers from different agencies within the City.

In Butuan City, according to the survey conducted by the researchers last January
2018 about consumers awareness on service interruption advisory, majority of the
consumers raised two agencies that disseminate advisory but consumers fail to receive
due to their accessibility to media and workload. This two was Butuan City Water
District (BCWD) and Agusan Del Norte Electric Cooperative, Inc. (ANECO). These are
the main service providers of water and electricity power for the whole city of Butuan.
These service providers regularly conduct service interruption such as Emergency Press
Release, Low Water Pressure, Water Service Interruption, Power Interruption, and
Intermittent Power Supply. Accordingly, these service providers have common media
strategies in disseminating information through local radio, bulletin, email, website,
social media, and rarely through text blasting where only registered and update
consumers phone numbers receives the information. In posting and disseminating
schedules of service interruption they mainly used the social media and the website.
The BCWD have used text blasting in disseminating advisory and was sent only to over
2,000 consumers’ phone numbers within Butuan City. But then, the service provider
didn’t get a way to collect consumers’ updated numbers so they discontinued this kind of

method. Today, advisory information.is only post to social media and their website.
Text blasting was used also by ANECO but like BCWD, this service provider
discontinued this strategy. They acquired consumers’ phone numbers only through
registration of new connections and didn’t update the phone numbers. They post

schedules of their service interruption through social media, rarely in local radio, bulletin

board, and website.

The main advantage of media strategies used by these service providers, the social
media has the potential to reach the advantage people that regularly have the access to the
internet. It is unlikely however to reach the most disadvantage people or groups due to
their workload, accessibility to internet and radio. Because of these a lot of consumers
still have a problem receiving service interruption advisory. They still get to experience
service interruption without receiving information and without preparation.

According to the survey conducted by the researchers last January 2018,
consumers with the total of 92% prefer to receive advisory through their mobile phones.
The mobile phone is now the most important device all over the world. Aside from calls
and messages, mobile devices now allow access to information and entertainment
anytime and anywhere. In 2017, 68% of the population of the Philippines is forecast to

use a mobile phone [3]. In Butuan City there are 90% of individuals uses the device. The
majority of mobile phone subscribers are able to receive both voice and alphanumeric
text via Short Messaging Service (SMS) transmissions. Not all mobile phones are able to
connect to the internet but can receive calls and SMS.

Thus, this study entitled “Unified Advisory Platform on Service Interruption in
Butuan City” is a Web-based application system that aims to provide an appropriate

dissemination of accurate and relevant information from the service providers about
4

service interruption activities to the consumers. Through early SMS advisory of service
interruption schedule, it would be able to reach the registered phone numbers of
consumers in Butuan City using mobile phones. Collected consumers’ updated phone
numbers every month as a requirement in paying consumers’ bill will be inputted to the
system. This early SMS advisory will be sent 2 to 3 days to the consumers before the
schedule of interruption. Consumers in the specific barangays included in the
interruption can only receive the SMS advisory. A copy of memorandum of service

interruption schedules will be sent 5 days before the schedule to Philippine Information

Agency (PIA) for reporting.

1.1 Background of the Study

The enactment of Republic Act 10121 otherwise known as the Philippine Disaster
Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010 has laid the basis for a paradigm shift from
just disaster preparedness and response to disaster risk reduction and management
(DRRM). The National DRRM Plan serves as the national guide on how sustainable
development can be achieved through inclusive growth while building the adaptive
capacities of communities; increasing the resilience of vulnerable sectors; and optimizing
disaster mitigation opportunities with the end in view of promoting people’s welfare and
security towards gender-responsive and rights-based sustainable development [1]. A plan
which serves as the national guide on how sustainable development can be achieved
through inclusive growth while building the adaptive capacities of communities; increasing
the resilience of vulnerable sectors; and optimizing disaster mitigation opportunities with
the end in view of promoting people’s welfare and security towards gender-responsive and
rights-based sustainable development. It outlines the activities aimed at strengthening the
capacity of the national government and the local government units (LGUs) together with
partner stakeholders, to build the disaster resilience of communities and to institutionalize
arrangements and measures for reducing disaster risks, including projected climate risks

and enhancing disaster preparedness and response capabilities at all levels.
to

The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Plan (NDRRMP) fulfills
the requirement of RA No, 10121 of 2010, which provides the legal basis for policies, plans
and programs to deal with disasters. The NDRRMP covers four thematic areas, namely,
(1) Disaster Prevention and Mitigation; (2) Disaster Preparedness; (3) Disaster Response;
and (4) Disaster Rehabilitation and Recovery, which correspond to the structure of the
National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC). By law, the
Office of Civil Defense formulates and implements the NDRRMP and ensures that the
physical framework, social, economic and environmental plans of communities, cities,
municipalities and provinces are consistent with such plan.

The Agusan del Norte Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council
(PDRRMC) uses Microsoft Excel in their office which according to them is inefficient in
inputting big data. The problem was, when a data file is too large, it can make the Excel
program run very slow, especially if all the data is in one file. Trying to break the data
down into smaller files can lead to some of it being lost or misplaced. To them — personnel
in-charge of record-keeping, excel is not user-friendly and the application rounds off very
large numbers using imprecise calculations, which compromises accuracy. Each time
employees make changes manually in Excel, there is a risk of introducing errors and
compromising accuracy. These mistakes are not only hard to locate further along the
process but can also negatively affect the bottom line. In terms of security, there is lacking

because anyone can open the files.

This study aims to develop a web-based monitoring system to identify and

provide information in decision-making. By interacting with the system, it can store

personal information. Every barangay of the 11 municipalities has the access to support
and manage their area. Moreover, this system will help to identify persons who need the
assistance of an officer. Problems on recording, updating, and easy access to records are

addressed through the developed system.

","CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

Background of the Study

Exercise is a very essential component to a man’s health. Aside from a healthy
diet, it is one of the keys to an overall health and wellness. The benefits of exercise have
been known since antiquity. Dating back to 65 BCE, it was Marcus Cicero, Roman
Politician and lawyer, who stated: It is exercise alone that supports the spirits, and keeps
the mind in vigor [1]. Research has indicated that physical exercise enhances health
including lowering risks of developing certain types of cancer, cardiovascular diseases,
and other serious illnesses [3]. Research also demonstrates that exercise is associated
with many psychological benefits including lowering depression, anxiety, and stress [4].

Studies show that half of people starting an exercise program will drop out in the
first six months [14]. Out of the 45 percent of people who make New Year’s resolutions
each year, only 8 percent actually succeeded, with 47 percent of people making vows to
self-improve and another 38 percent making weight-related goals. According Becky
McColl (2016) Indoor workouts maybe more comfortable, but it’s understandable to
fright the monotony of the gym. That’s why others prefer indoor exercise with the aid of
some exercising equipment and devices. Stationary bicycle and treadmill are some of the
best equipment to suit the need; these are powerful rehabilitation exercising devices, due
to its natural rhythmic component and are easy to use, but often people complain about
particular machine exercises or the monotonous nature of the treadmill/stationary bike,

and with good reason, those exercises can be quite boring.
The goal of this project is to develop an application that will incorporate Virtual
Reality technology and auditory simulation to stationary bicycle and treadmill platform
simple way to spice up routine and beat boredom on the treadmill along with its sensor
relay.

The possible benefits of this approach would not involve not only physical
exercise but increment in cognitive skills. It is a powerful rehabilitation and also
exercising system for those people who cannot perform difficult and power demanding

exercises, but they still want and should exercise (e.g. elderly).

","1.1 Background of the Study

For many developing countries, there is a general lack of geoexploration data
required for a reliable and comprehensive nationwide mineral potential assessment and
classification. This lack of geoexploration data and nationwide comprehensive mineral
potential assessment and classification have, in the Philippines for example, brought
about conflicts and competing demands between land uses that permit mineral resources
development and those that promote protection of ecosystems.

Artisanal or small scale mining varies from country to country because of the
different set of criteria or parameters used. For decades, experts worked to devise
universal definitions of “artisanal” and “small-scale” mining but were unable to reach a
consensus. Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is however popularly referred
to as mining activities that use rudimentary techniques in extracting minerals, most

commonly gold, by miners working in small sized operations [1].
In Caraga region, the project 3: Monitoring, Assessment and Profiling of
Artisanal and Small-scale Gold Mining (MAP-ASGM) in Key Areas in Mindanao funded
by DOST, is gathering information of the owners of every artisanal and small-scale gold
mining by conducting surveys on areas where such mining activities are operating. The
information gathered by their surveys is to be used for present and future research of the
S & T Program for Responsible Mining in Mindanao. The storage of the gathered
information among ASGM owners and the difficulty of accessing information such as
mining area and processing plant’s GPS location and the mining method and equipment
used per province were identified to be the current problems. The proponents of this
study propose a Database Application for ASGM with Map Rendering.

The system identifies and profiles the artisanal and small-scale gold mining
owners in Caraga region that can allow the researchers of MAP-ASGM to store and share
research data to LGU’s of Caraga region and with the power of graphical information and

Solid waste is a societal problem that we are facing today. The more people that are
created the more garbage that are produced. The garbage that are not collected by the
authorities results to air pollution, soil pollution and water pollution that dispose anywhere
by the resident. Because of the act by the resident the authorities implement a legislative
provision for the garbage collection, collection points are built and approved. With this act
by the resident we came up with the solution that creating a mobile application that can
report the garbage problem in the society is the best way to reduce the illegal dumping of
garbage. Similarly, scheduling for garbage collection in every barangay of Butuan City,.
viewing of collection points that built by the barangay level through google maps

scheduled to collect their garbage. Some residents want to dispose their garbage that is not
in scheduled time, this application has a feature to request a pickup garbage collector to
dump their garbage.

Keywords: Solid Waste, Notification, Android-Based, Collection Point
","Introduction

1.1 Background of the Study

Solid waste is an environmental and societal problem in the world that has reach
critical proportion in the Philippines. Due to the rapidly growing of population, the
population of the human race is doubled and the more people in the world that are created,
the more garbage that are produced [3].

In the National Capital Region of the Philippines they generate a large amount of
garbage and according to statistics, one-fourth (4) of the garbage that are produced will

reached almost 0.7kg that the resident generates per day; or this is about 130 percent higher

than the global average of waste generated by one person per day which is at 0.3kg [15].
This would result in the clogging drainage system and waterways and caused outbreak of © .
diseases such as dengue fever and leptospirosis [3]. Uncollected garbage end up blocking

local ditches, drainage system, and rivers, which contribute to the floods.
Butuan City, where this study is focused is not exempted in this prevalent societal
problem. The local government have come up with the scheduling of garbage collection
per barangay over the number of garbage truck; Collection Points are built; and legislative
provisions are being passed and approved, but still a lot of localities dump their garbage
anywhere in the areas not seen by authorities. Many have complaint that their garbage is
not collected in a timely manner, and non-observance of garbage collection timetable is
being experienced and there is no direct information dissemination with regards to change
of schedule or no collection on that certain time and no tool available to view all the
Collection Points or near- Collection Points and their schedules for possible decision —
making on the part of the household.

To address such issues, a way of mind setting and culture changing would be a great
help plus with a strong and strict implementation on the rules and regulations pertaining
therein. Another way to aid such pain is to take opportunity of this emerging technologies
through developing an application that would notify certain residents about the schedule of
garbage collection.

In this application, the proponent design a system which generates a map that
nts or garbage collection point in different areas in the grass root

locates Collection Poi

level. The app will seamlessly push alarm notification to the residents near on that

collection point in an ample time if the garbage collector is scheduled on that area. Thus,

providing reliable information with regards to collection of garbage. Features such as,

request for collection, seeding of uncollected garbage, tracking and monitoring of garbage

collectors will also be incorporated. A private collector module will also be part of this
project, as a way to give the public to choose a collector in the event of special collection
of garbage not stated in the timetable of collection.

This study is to help the society and environment to have a clean and green lifestyle,
not to eliminate the garbage but to put into order the dumping and collection of garbage
aiding this technology. When properly implemented and accepted, the main beneficiary is

the public and those who have direct effect on this endeavor, thus, a healthier environment

INTRODUCTION

Advisement process is a major function ofany academic institution and one of the
most essential stages during the Student Registration. However, during registration period
in Caraga State University (CSU) particularly at the Department of Information
Technology, manual and the one on one system of advising the students on the courses
that he/she needs to take up are still being used in which the students and faculty may

find it very time consuming, hassle and frequent advising errors occur like some of the
students could take up of such courses even without taking the pre-requisites in the
previous semesters.

Academic advising is a decision making process through which a student advised
by an advisor, maximizes the educational experience through interaction specifically
pertinent to both curricular and career planning. Better academic advising increases the
probability of the student staying in school and it also improves the chance that students
will feel that the institution cares about them, it improves the likelihood that they will
succeed in their classes and that they will continue to make progress in the field of study

that the student chose [1].

This study aims to enhance the quality of advising phase by means of developing
a tule-based student advisor system using expert system. There are a lot of definitions of
Expert System, but a general definition that is intended to such functions is that it is an
interactive computer-based decision tool that uses both facts and heuristics to solve

difficult decision problems based on knowledge acquired from an expert [2].
Human expert knowledge is being used in conventional rule-based expert systems
in solving real world problems. Rule-based expert systems have played an important role

Systematic Random Sampling was the statistical method used to avoid bias in
identifying the respondents of the study. Slovin’s formula was utilized to identify
the sample size. Questionnaires were administered on two high schools (Caraga State
University (CSU) and Butuan City School of Arts (BCSAT) and Trades in Butuan City.
The self-made questionnaires were consisted of pre-test and post-test for both groups
(Traditional Teaching Method (TTM) and Computer-Based Teaching Method (CBTM))

and an evaluation questionnaire exclusive only for CBTM setup.
The results with respect to the school (CSU and BCSAT) showed that when
comparing the resulting mean of the post-test exam of the CBTM from both schools is
higher than the resulting mean of the TTM. It also gained a qualitative interpretation
which is equal to Very Satisfactory. From these results, the researchers can conclude that

the Computer-Based Training Method is usable and can substitute the Traditional

Teaching Method.

INTRODUCTION

Traditional teaching is a teacher centered approach in which students attend the
lecture, listen, and take down notes. Students after the lecture will then review their notes
and recall the information. With this kind of teaching-learning environment, students
cannot completely understand the basic concepts, particularly given the lack of active
participation. This approach may not provide students with valuable skills or even with a
body of knowledge that lasts much beyond the end of the term [2]. Also, using this
approach makes the students get tired and impatient who later on resorts on doing
something else instead of listening to the teacher.

Computer-based learning is increasingly used to enhance learning. Because of
which, the researchers give rise to a multimedia presentation with Open Office.org Writer
as its package as a part of the pursuit to induce learning about open source software to
high school students. Multimedia presentation software is known for incorporating
sound, animation effects and cinematic-like special effects into presentations. It is a tool
that computer users of varying industries and backgrounds use to dynamically present
information to an audience. It differs from standard presentation software in its features
and its interactivity potential. Through this, they will no longer imagine what the

application does and how to use it because by just listening and looking at the structured
presentation, one can already get the idea [2].
However, reports suggest that more educational research should be performed to

find out how usable computer-based learning (CBL) really is (Campbell and Johnson,
1999). The researchers propose to measure the Usability of Multimedia Presentation in
Open Office Writer.org. Relative to this, the study attempts to compare the two teaching
methods (traditional and the computer-based) to selected 4"" year secondary students in

Butuan City and determine the factors affecting the usability of the said computer-based

learning tool.

"ZASSESSMENT OF THE AUTOMATED SOLID WASTES CLASSIFIER
","ABSTRACT

This study seeks to address the automation of solid wastes classifier per area of
the major wastes fraction as defined from the source data. It will also conduct an
assessment on the automated system in order to prove that the automation of the pattern

used by humans to classify solid wastes is accurate and correct. Solid wastes data were
acquired from the every available media forms, from past years up to the present. Due to
the large amount of data gathered, the Classification technique was used to match
patterns for the result recommendations. The data were pre-processed by manual
extraction of possible keywords and implemented in MySQL 5.0. After pre-processing
the data, a series of experiments were made with the prototype to test the accuracy of the
patterns used for classification. During each experiment, the dataset was divided into two
sets, one was a controlled set, with 110 total inputs and the other was a random set, with
25 randomly selected respondents, with 112 total inputs. The controlled set appeared to
be 93 percent accurately classified and the random set appeared to be 95 percent
accurately classified. Results were acquired by using frequency distribution. The

keywords formulated from the analyzed data were successfully implemented in PHP 5.0
and MySQL 5.0.

INTRODUCTION

Classification is an art of forming or dividing into classes, according to Webster.
On the other hand, municipal solid wastes or collectively called solid wastes are one of
today’s world problems. This problem can be found anywhere and everywhere, that is

here locally. This, both terms can be apply to local, national, or even international

concerm.

Solid wastes are often classified as municipal but considered solid wastes as a
whole, and commonly refers to municipal solid wastes and urban wastes that include
domestic or households wastes. Across the globe there are facts eoncettitie the problem
of solid wastes managements and disposals. California for example, one of America’s

states conducted studies that focused on the issue. [7]

Locally, the Department of Natural Sciences of the College of Arts and Sciences
of the Caraga State University is handling special researches concerning solid wastes,
particularly municipal solid wastes. One of the concerns of their research is the
classification of solid wastes, which enable them to identify other concerns. Wastes have
always been a problem to everyone. It seems that the more products we produced the
more wastes we need to get rid off and classify in the first place, for the proper treatment

of each wastes.

Currently, the Dept. of Natural Sciences has no electronic data in handling the

classified solid wastes samples per area for research references which will be an aid of
the Department and other researchers. Thus, the proponent identifies the following
problems: There is no automated classification of municipal solid wastes through its
description or its material type; and no existing database for those wastes and
classifications locally. With these problems, there is a great need for a development of a
system which would classify automatically solid waste descriptions with respect to the

areas of classification for further research references.

This study, “(Municipal) Solid Waste-Descriptions Classification System”, aims
to classify solid waste-descriptions based on the classified solid waste material types and
definitions. This design would further serve as a databank of the classified solid waste

descriptions.

","Introduction

1.1 Background of the Study

Rice (oryza sativa) is an important staple food in the world. Despite its position
among the highly rated cereals, it feeds more than half of the world's population. Rice is
grown in tropical, semi tropical and temperate regions; mostly in coastal plains, tidal deltas,
and river basins. Rice provides 21% of global human per capita energy and 15% of per
capita protein. It is considered as the ideal model plant to study grass genetics and genome
organization due to its diploid nature, comparatively small genome size [1], considerable
level of genetic polymorphism [2], a large amount of well conserved genetically diverse
materials and fully sequenced genome [3].

Philippine Rice Research Institute (PhilRice) is a government corporate entity
attached to the Department of Agriculture created through Executive Order 1061 on 5
November 1985 (as amended) to help develop high-yielding and cost-reducing

technologies so farmers can produce enough rice for all Filipinos including Caraganons
specifically in Agusan del Norte. The institute accomplishes this mission through research
and development work in central and six branch stations, coordinating with a network that
comprises 57 agencies and 70 seed centers strategically located nationwide.

The institute has to attain rice self-sufficiency by increasing the productivity and
profitability of rice farmers in a sustainable and competitive manner but there is no tool
that will help rice growers or farmers to support on the decision making when it comes to
good selection of rice variety since farmers have difficulty in the appointment for the
consultant of rice experts due to the distance of the office of PhilRice [4].

Rule-based expert systems have the ability to emulate the decision making ability
of human experts. They are designed to solve problems as humans do, by exploiting
encoded human knowledge or expertise. This knowledge can be extracted and acquired
directly through interaction with humans, as well as from printed and electronic resources
such as books, magazines and websites [5].

With the development of the web-based system on the Automation of Rice Variety

Identification, it may help the rice growers to know first the rice varieties that are suitable

for different location in Agusan del Norte. The researchers decided to implement the study

for the betterment of the farmers as well as the stakeholders as they may ensure rice

productivity and profitability.

1.1 Background of the Study

With the rise of mobile phone applications, so-called apps, people today are more
looking for information on the go. This is one area of mobile phone technology
enhancement that allows developers and programmers to offer users just what they seek
under their preferred area of interest. Now a day Google's open-source Android mobile
platform has been a powerful competitor of mobile operating system and drawn the
attention of the leading manufacturers of the industry and became a hot spot of research.

The main advantage of adopting Android is that it offers a unified approach to application

development. Developers need only develop for Android, and their applications should

be able to run on numerous different devices, as long as the devices are powered using

Android.

In the Philippines the buses are travelling anytime without the awareness of the
people if there is still bus that is traversing. Many people waiting for the buses and it is

time consuming and exhausting to wait buses without knowing the location of the bus. It
can cause traffic if the waiting passenger continually increases. Passengers also do not
know that the bus they are waiting have still available seats.

The purpose of this research is to develop an Android-based Application Bus
Conductor to Passenger Communication (B2P) that will provide information to the
people about the estimated time of departure (ETD), the current station/terminal and final
destination of specific trip of any dispatching bus. It also provides the user about capacity
or status of the bus. The application has a Web-based feature that can track the
dispatching bus by presenting it on the map. It can help passengers/travelers to know
more information about the bus they are waiting. It also helps them to know that there are

still available trips of the bus. The system also includes a seat reservation to give the

riding public a convenient trip by assuring there will be seat allotted for the passengers.

Introduction

1.1 Background of the Study

Computer technology progress has led to widespread use of computerized support

in various activities. Particularly, traditional decision support system (DSS) focus on
computerized support for making decision with respect to managerial problems. Decision
Support Systems is a broad area of research and practice. According to
DSSResources.com, a “Decision Support System (DSS)” is an interactive computer-
based system or subsystem intended to help decision makers use communications
technologies, data, documents, knowledge and/or models to identify and solve problems,
complete decision process tasks, and make decisions.

Weather Forecasting (especially rainfall) is one of the most important and
challenging operational tasks carried out by meteorological services all over the world.
. The important hydrological event rainfall is the quantity of water falling in drops from
vapor condensed in the atmosphere [1]. When water droplets in clouds become too heavy

to stay in the air, they fall out towards the ground.
Z

This study developed an appropriate model to predict rainfall density for different
gauge station of Mindanao. Making reliable prediction about rainfall density is very
important in many areas of human activities. Rainfall mainly controls our water supplies,
which are the basis for crops production. Although water is vital to life, yet water can be
extremely destructive. Thus, rainfall forecasting can warn people if there’s a flood or
drought that can save their lives and properties. In urban areas, rainfall has a strong
influence on traffic control, operations of sewer systems and others. Thus, the researcher
believed that precise rainfall prediction is important for practitioners who are interested to

make wise policies related to this event.

1.1 Background of the Study

A language is a way of speaking that varies from place to place [7]. Language are
present in everyone’s speech, no matter where one is located or which cultural group one
belongs to. Dialect is influenced by age, education, social class, regional, and ethnic
background [8]. Philippines is among of the country who speak numerous language.

Butuan, and often referred to as Butuan City, is a highly urbanized city in the
Philippines. It is known for its colorful history and culture. The name “Butuan” is believed
to have originated from a sour fruit locally called “Batuan”. Located at the Northeastern

part of Agusan Valley sprawling across Agusan River in the Island of Mindanao. The city
is the regional center of the Caraga Region. Butuan’s history, culture, arts, and people date
back to the 4"" Century as showcased in museums and festivals, makes Butuan as exciting
source of cultural artifacts in Mindanao. Its own language, the Butuanon language makes

the city more distinctively remarkable [9].

A recent change of the Philippine educational system was implemented stated at
2011. The K to 12 Basic Education Program covers Kindergarten and 12 years of basic
education (six years of primary education, four years of Junior Hi gh School, and two years
of Senior High School) to provide a holistic education for all. Now congested, it will give
students ample time to master basic academic skills as well as to participate in co-curricular

1.1 Background of the Study

The internet has revolutionized the travel industry both as a source of information
and a sales channel. Online marketing, photographs and consumer reviews are bringing
destinations and attractions to the screens of potential travelers around the world. The ease
with which a customer can review and compare travel options opens up new markets for

both large and small businesses [12].

Ecotourism is an increasingly popular form of tourism in which tourists seek out
wild and scenic areas such as rainforests or mountains for an active and educational trip. It
is a segment of the travel industry which appeals to the environmentally conscious and has
low impact on the surrounding area while contributing to the local economy. Tourism is
travel for recreational, leisure, or business purposes, usually of a limited duration. Tourism

is commonly associated with trans-national travel, but may also refer to travel to another
location within the same country. The World Tourism Organization defines tourists as
1. ns ° ry Py ry ‘
people ""traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than

one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes [9].

Along with ecotourism is the existence of reservation systems where tourists can
make a phone reservation, online reservation and group reservations about the preliminary
constraints for them to have meaningful visit to their desired destinations. Reservations
may be applicable to food venues, hotels or even the tourist spot itself. Depending on your
industry, there are marketing channels that promote your business and availability allowing
visitors to book reservations through their websites. Websites such as Travelocity and
Expedia, travel agents and third party services, can provide you with additional business

revenue. Their compensation traditionally comes in the form of a fee or a percentage of the

reservation [11].

One initiative of the City Government of Butuan is the Ecotourism Infrastructure
Projects: Greenbelt, Bood, Arboretum, and Sports Complex which entails the
development of a certain areas and facilities of the city into ecotourism sites. Through this
initiative, the LGU will invest in the development of government properties and
infrastructure, after which, the private sectors will be invited to locate and operate in the
ecotourism areas [2]. To name a few, the city government of Butuan has developed the
following tourist spots as part of its environmental initiatives: Bood, Arboritum, Masao
(Magellan’s Anchorage), Pagatpatan Wet Lands, Museum, Banza Shrine, Mayapay /
Bonbon — Natural Reserved / Protected Area, Lawaan Eco Park, Brgy. Pocket Forest, Cave

at Pianing, Mayapay as Cultural Exchange, Anticala Falls, and Water ways.
On the other hand, tourism is one of the major growing sources of income which is
slowly developed. As tourism reaches another height of percentage to government revenue
which changing annually, the Office of the Strategic Management of the City Government
of Butuan solicited assistance from the proponents to create an application which would

cater the tourist needs especially to those who wants a tour package from a certain group

who will offer.

To shore up effectively of the idea and to provide grand impact to humanities,
innovative marketing strategies are essential, integrated to its point-forward initiatives
towards achieving the goal, the proponents have developed a “Trip Advisor and Booking
Centre of the Eco Tourist Spots in the City Government of Butuan”. The techno-kind
advisor is a web application that will enable the tourist to book a tour package from a

certain group of registered people who will cater the tourist in giving a tour to every spots

1.1 Background and Rationale

The traditional role of teaching focuses on the teacher as organizers of teaching-
learning activity, providers of information and experts of knowledge. The teacher carries
too much of responsibility for teaching in the classroom to make sure everything they are
teaching is understood by the students or we can say there is a typical way to control class
where the teacher teaches using blackboard, explains concepts, asks students to copy and
makes sure that students are paying attention [19].

Interaction among learners is also an important element of the learning process.
However, the vast majority of individualized instructional programs are individually based
and student-paced. Students generally work at their own pace, independently of their
classmates, and move on to new material only after they have demonstrated certain mastery
of each unit. The teacher’s role is primarily to give individual assistance when needed

rather than to be a principal source of new information [13].
In classroom learning situation, however, there appear to be great differences in the
talent of learners to learn: some learn quit easily and rapidly, while others need more time,
and some seem to have a little ability even if they make a serious effort [22].

Two students may both lack understanding of a topic or phenomenon, but may think
about it in very different ways. In order to offer appropriate, personalized learning
experiences, teachers need to understand how individual students are thinking [18]. In
personalized learning scenarios [22] suggest that the need for more flexible learning
arrangements whereby the fast learners are encouraged to take on more demanding learning
task than the slow learners and work for both accurate and fluent communication skills.
Hence, the slow learners were unable to manage to deal to learn lessons with fast learners
when the slow learners were not given enough time and attention to understand the subject

matter.

In addition, in some time, several teachers were unaware of the quickness of the
lesson discussed. When more and more lessons were not completely realized by numerous
learners in a class specifically the slow learners, the more is the lessons were not
appreciated by the learners. Study [2] suggests that the positive gains evidence in most
mastery learning programs come mainly from continually providing greater amounts of
learning time for students who are experiencing problems or difficulties of the lesson.

If some learners, then, can process second language data more quickly than others, there is
need to release learners from the necessity all at the same rate, but this does not need to
imply permanent ability grouping of learners. Such different aims can also be

accommodated within a basically heterogeneous, mixed-ability class using cooperative
learning techniques and individual learning contracts negotiated between teacher and

learners [22].

Along these lines, use of ICT in teaching develops higher order skills such as
collaborating across time and place and solving complex real world problems [14]. It
improves the students’ perception and understanding of the world. Thus, ICT can be used
to prepare the workforce for the information society and the new global economy [12].

Accordingly, the growing availability of media resources is changing teaching and
learning, as well as emphasizing the need for finding satisfactory and appropriate materials.
Though thousands of documents exist to assist teachers and students, specific information
is neither easy to locate nor easy to satisfy the general guiding principles that have evolved
[23]. This has resulted in teachers being more comfortable with the use of technology in
the classroom.

This study, the Location Voting Facility in Sharing Presentation Display
Management is facilitated with opinion voting tool that supports the teacher to distinguish
learners who does not process to topic rapidly and needs more time to understand the
information given. Furthermore, the voting tool mechanism of the system is designed to
enable the student to develop a group effort to learn the specific idea known. Also, this

mechanism allows the learners to interact with each other constituted all the way through

to sharing of purposeful knowledge.

This challenge in Location Voting Facility in Sharing Presentation Display

Management and the possible solutions supported by technology had been the main focus

of this study.

"A PLATFORM FOR SANITARY RECORD MANAGEMENT WITH MULTIPLE
DELIVERY SYSTEMS
","iv

ABSTRACT

Currently, sanitary inspections in Butuan City are recorded manually. With a
population of thousands of establishments around the city to be inspected with only nine
(9) sanitation inspectors, it is irrational and thus effecting to problems like difficulty in
tracking records and delay in report generation. To attend to these, a platform for sanitary
record management with multiple delivery systems was developed to solve the problems
and have a synchronization of data and the various ways to deliver establishment details

and inspection results to the establishment owners through electronic mail, Short Service

Message (SMS), Portable Document Format (PDF)/.txt file sharing. Moreover, a mobile

application was developed wherein the inspection results will be saved and automatically

sent to the server eliminating the redundant processes of the current system in entry of
results, difficulty in tracking records and the delay in report generation. The developers

conducted a Usability Test to measure the usefulness, accuracy, mobile app and system
environment and satisfaction level of the platform with the seven (7) out of (9) inspectors
including their officer-in-charge using a 4-level Likert Scale. The four (4) categories gained
an agree percentage of 85.86%, 100%, 100% and 100% respectively surpassing the 51-

75% acceptability among the target users.

","CHAPTER 1, INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background of the study

Sanitary Permit according to the “Code on Sanitation of the Philippines Presidential

or Decree Number 856 (P.D. 856)”, is the certification in writing of the city or municipal
health officer or sanitary engineer that the establishment complied with the existing
minimum sanitation requirements upon evaluation or inspection conducted in accordance
with Presidential Decrees Number. 522 and 856 and local ordinances. It is one of the
requirements to register and renew any type of business along the Latest Mayor's Permit,
the Barangay Clearance, the Community Tax Certificate with Gross Receipt, the Financial
Statement (Partnerships and Corporations), the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR)
Clearance, the Social Security System (SSS) Clearance and the Environmental Compliance
Certificate (ECC) or Certificate of Non-Coverage (CNC) [10]. A sanitary inspection is
conducted by the City Sanitation Inspectors for the permit to be released and to make sure
that “all establishments shall operate only in accordance with the set of sanitation standard
as stipulated in Department of Health Order Number. 258-B, s. 1991” under Part D—
Requirements regarding the use of service spaces based on the Sanitation Code. A sanitary
inspection is an evaluation of every establishment requiring a sanitary permit for its
operations, and an additional monthly re—inspections for the enforcement of the provisions
of these rules and regulations. This percentage result is derived from the Sanitation

Inspector’s evaluation on the sanitation requirements for operating an establishment upon

conducting the inspection [12].

regulati i
gulations, standards and other reference materials needed in the inspection and (3)

materials for measuring, taking photos, sampling, etc. The inspection form has twenty (20)

items. Non-compliance items are indicated with (X). Each of which is weighted with a
demerit of 5%. The rating of the establishment is therefore 100 less (number of demerits x
5%). The result is expressed as percentage (%) rating and below 50% shall be
recommended for suspension of operation until compliance. If the establishment passed
the inspection, the owner can go back to the City Health Office within the same day with
their copy of the inspection form to claim the Sanitary Permit that will be the establishment
owner’s license to operate and is renewable every year from January | to 20, along with
other requirements. If failed, the sanitation inspector may cause to be served on the owner,
a notice (Sanitary Order) requiring him/her within fifteen (15) days to take such remedial
action as may be specified therein. In the event of non-compliance within the terms of the
Sanitary Order, the sanitation inspector may cause the issuance of a second and third notice
to the owner of the establishment. If still failed on the third time, the sanitation inspector

oe g d to
shall require the owner to present him/herself at a committee hearing and can lea

ion to the health
revocation of the permit. The owner can also file a motion for reconsideration

‘. daily inspections to a
authority. All the sanitation inspectors manually transfer their daily insp
logbook so each of them can create a monthly accomplishment report by also recounting
and reviewing the ones listed in the logbooks. They also have a consolidated quarterly
accomplishment report in which one of the sanitation inspectors add up the total

accomplishments of the nine (9) inspectors. For January 2018, there has been a total of six

thousand, two hundred thirty-four (6,234) inspections.

With the current system, the following issues has been observed. First, the
procedures in checking the requirements and entry of records are done repeatedly. Second,
the issuance of mission order containing the schedule for inspection per inspector is
dependent on the decision of the sanitation administrator. Third, during on-site inspection,
the inspectors have to refer to the P.D. 856 for referral of the demerit items which allots
more time in iterating on EHS Form No. 103 under column “Recommended Corrective
Measures”. Lastly, there is a difficulty in tracking the daily results of inspection which
leads to delay in generation of the accomplishment reports.

With these, the paper aims to design and develop a platform supporting the entire
process from application to issuance. Wherein the establishment owners can receive short
message service (SMS), portable document format (pdf)/text file and electronic mail (e-

mail) on the results and updates of the inspection, for the inspectors to input their daily

inspections and have an easier tracking. This paper aims to provide a time efficient for the

sanitation officers and the establishment owners.

","ABSTRACT

Regular prenatal care is seen to be the best assurance to have a healthy and happy

pregnancy and to make sure that the pregnant and the unborn child are getting the right

care. After mother’s delivery, the infant has to be regularly checked by a pediatrician.

However, undergoing to this kind of healthcare procedure is not that easy. A web-based
system, on the other hand, was developed by the researchers to provide a complete

1.1 Background of the Study

Pregnancy, also known as gestation, is the time during which one or more
offspring develops inside a woman. It is divided into three trimesters. The first trimester
is from week 1 through 12 and includes conception. The first trimester carries the highest
risk of miscarriage (natural death of embryo or fetus). The second trimester is from week
13 through 28. Around the middle of the second trimester, movement of the fetus may be
felt. The third trimester is from 29 weeks through 40 weeks.

Prenatal care is the term used for women to receive health care before and during
pregnancy to decrease the risk of complications. Based on the KidsHealth from Nemours
study, millions of American women gave birth every year, and nearly a third of had some
kind of pregnancy-related complications. Those who do not get proper prenatal care run

the risk that such complications won’t be detected or won’t be dealt with soon enough,
that can lead to potentially serious consequences for both the mother and the baby [1].

Prenatal care can be given to a pregnant woman through these entities: (a)
obstetricians, a doctor who specializes pregnancy and childbirth, (6)
obstetricians/gynecologists (OB/GYNs), a doctor who specializes pregnancy and
childbirth, as well as women’s health care, (c) family practitioners, a doctor who provides
range of services for patients of all ages (sometimes, this includes obstetrical care)
instead of specializing in one area, and (d) certified nurse-midwife, an advanced practice

nurse specializes in women’s health care needs, including prenatal care, labor and
delivery, and postpartum care for pregnancies without complications. Any of these care
providers is a better choice depending on the complexity of the pregnant status.

Regular prenatal care is seen to be the best assurance to have a healthy and happy
pregnancy and to make sure that the pregnant and the unborn child are getting the right
care. After mother’s delivery, the infant has to be regularly checked by a pediatrician. A
pediatrician is a doctor specializes in taking care of infants, children, and adolescents. It
is recommended that people be under pediatric care up to the age of 21.

However, undergoing to this kind of healthcare procedure is not that easy. In
Butuan City, common to all healthcare providers is to have a predefined schedule of duty
to each clinic or hospital where it was connected or accredited with. In the event where

pregnant and child patients have to be checked, the procedure is to visit the clinic and or
hospital prior to the defined doctor’s schedule for a first-come, first served basis
regardless of whether the doctor is coming or not. Sometimes, healthcare assistants do

not have any idea of the emergency schedules of the doctor. Depending on the client's

relationship to the healthcare staff, there were patients who would just call the clinic staff

to put the name on the priority list, which in fact not fair for the first time clinic walk-ins

and to those who patiently waiting for their time to be checked.

Finding and choosing of an obstetrician and pediatrician is another concern of the

pregnant and or mother. She has to make sure that she would be getting the right

healthcare provider by asking referrals from a doctor as well. According to Family

Education, there are many ways that a pregnant can find a doctor, but probably the best

way is through word-of-mouth, talking to friends who have had babies and get

recommendations [2].

= strona
On the period of regular consultation, there are instances that a pregnant and or

mother forgets to take medicine and vitamins. For a pregnant and child diagnosed with
complications, not taking medication properly leads to unnecessary hospital admissions,
illness, and even deaths. Not taking vitamins prevents the various natural substances that
are essential to the nutrition of the mother and development of the fetus in the womb.
Also, there is a tendency that a pregnant and or mother failed to remember specific
records of the pregnancy and of a child, a proper recording and retrieving of these records
would be a better answer.

The mentioned grounds above and other underpinning difficulties on pregnancy
and child’s development prompt the eagerness of the researchers to find appropriate
solutions through the great contribution of the growing technology and trends of mobile
applications. The “Pregnancy and Child Monitoring Solution” or “PreChiMoS” will be
developed by the researchers to provide efficient, cost and time savings experiences for

pregnant and or mother.

Introduction

1.1 Background of the Study

In the middle of the last century, transportation agencies were only
interested on the main transportation facilities and the expansion of major road
networks. At the end ofthe century transportation investments that depend on roads
and bridges has grown. Accordingly, the agencies have become vulnerable of
accountability as any other economic organizations [1]. If the work continues as it is, the
agencies and their owners will face many difficulties due to the rising requirements with
limited budgets and staff [2]. All agencies related to transportation must be prepared in
meeting the requirements of the public with this radical growth of population.

Road management has become increasingly more complex day by day. As the
population increases the traffic volume also increases. A set of tools is needed to manage
road networks and guide decision makers or engineers to make consistent and cost
effective measures regarding pavement maintenance, rehabilitation and replacement
needs.

According to Mohamed Sayed Saleh (2011), Geographic Information Systems

(GIS) are moving to web-based applications which offer specific geo-processing
functionality and transparently exchanging data among them [3]. Web-GIS software’s

high costs and special requirements have prevented many organizations from deploying

their data and geo-processing capabilities over internet. There are no-cost Open Source

Software (OSS) alternatives to proprictary software. We tested the potential of the
combined use of Open Specifications OS and OSS to create web-based spatial
information solutions. Paper presents the steps taken in creating Web-Based GIS
Application using OSS .I conclude that OS and OSS allow the development of web-based
spatial information solutions that are low-cost, simple to implement, compatible with
existing information technology infrastructure, and have the potential of interoperating
with other systems and applications in the future.

A pavement management system (PMS) provides effective tools and methods
that can assist decision makers in formulating optimum strategies for providing and
maintaining a serviceable pavement network over a given time period [4]. PMS have
been implemented and operated since the late 1970s and early 1980s to varying degrees
of success all over the world.

GIS can be used to expand and enhance each of PMS components. A GIS can
be designed as a platform on which the PMS is built and operated. GIS have played a
major role to develop spatial data information of federal and state and private
sector agencies. It is able to define the position of each asset and its proximity to
another asset, and each event and its proximity with another events therefore, using
of modem GIS in utilities become more advanced than the past using as

computerizing mapping systems [5].
Hence, this study developed a Web-Based GIS application that could provide a
user interface that could informed the public about information on roads such as its
condition, construction and maintenance activities; and can be used for decision makin

","CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTION

Automation has great importance nowadays especially in every institution. It
plays an increasingly important role in the global economy and in daily experience. It
will not just improve the work efficiency; it also gives a reliable tool for various
operations in the institution. Paper- based document circulation is a tedious work and it is
also hard to keep track. The proponents will develop a system that could help the
employees in Caraga State University (CSU) especially in document processing. This
institution is comprised of different offices like the college and universities all over the

world who aspire modernization of systems.

CSU aims to provide a better service not just to the students but also to the faculty
as well and to compete with other high standard colleges and universities, not only in

Caraga, but also in other regions, especially in terms of Information Technology.

The transaction of documents in CSU is handled manually. Some of these
documents are the Purchase Request, Quotation, Bidding, Purchase Order and Abstract of
Quotation. These documents have to be signed by different office heads. These
documents passed from one office to the next until all the required signatures have been
affixed. The documents are to be logged in the logbook whenever it arrives in an office

by a clerk or any employee assigned to it. Whenever there will be mistakes in the
document, the office head will attach comments or a note that will notify the requisitioner

about the mistakes or lack in his/her document.

An office head or a clerk may follow up or track the requested document

personally or by just calling the offices involved in signing the document.

The other offices do not apply or do the practice of logging in the document
received and, because of this; it causes problems in the tracking of the document. This

will result to the loss of the said document since there is no way to trace where it went.

An automated document tracking is needed to solve those problems. It will trace
the document sent by the requisitioner by simply viewing it at the system which is
embedded in the CSU website. But before the tracking of the document can be done, the
requisitioner will make a circulation first by simply doing it to his page in the system
after giving the document to the first receiver or signatory. And after that, he will just
wait in the office where he/she belongs and can track the document by looking it at the

page provided for him/her.

One of the advantages that the institution could get in adopting the proposed
Document Circulation System is that it would give them access to the documents being
transacted by inquiring online. This system tries to give some information to the sender
about his transaction. Through online tracking, the user can easily access the information

and from time to time update the said document.
Implementing this system in this institution does not require changing the way
the employees work to improve the efficiency of their work processes. With a quality
web- based document circulation system as the solution; one can work the way one
always have without the clutter and limitations of paper. In fact, according to research
conducted by the Gartner Group when implementing a document circulation management

solution, the organization will reduce overall document- related costs by 40% [1].

Document Circulation System is a system that tracks the document. This system
is generally responsible for the processing and inquiring the information through an
online system, which is utilized in order to discharge the function. This involves a
considerable number of offices and departments considering the fact that these offices
and departments are situated in a geographical challenging location. This system will
help develop the current system so as to make the work lighter and faster - eradicating
delays of time. This system aims to provide the fastest accessibility of information
through online system. It will process the display of information and the status of their

documents.

Users are able to define documents which are sent step by step to every
office/user in a list. It is an electronic way in doing internal document circulations. The
physical location and actions taken to a document can be easily and quickly confirmed.
There may be advantages and disadvantages regarding the adoption of the system, yet
introducing a more efficient system like the Document Circulation System would provide

a new avenue for further improvement and better service to its clienteles.
Most tracking and circulation of documents are done by a clerk through recording
the numbers or punching it into the computer by hand. But the falling price of computer
coding technology now makes it very affordable for every institution to keep track of
every document with unbeatable accuracy, and even track the document as they move
from one process to another through the organization or hierarchy. This enables an
organization or hierarchy to automate paper- based requisitioning processes without
having to install software on each computer. Requesitioners are given access to transact
their request online without experiencing any hassle in processing the transaction.
Requestioners just have to log in with their username and password, input the document’s

identification number and they can do their transaction on-line. Tracking is possible in

just a minute.

One of the most important factors in how successful a document circulation
system will be is its being user-friendly. Usability is critical in encouraging rapid staff
acceptance. A system will only be widely used if it simple to capture, organize and find
documents. The best system are user- friendly and flexible enough to adapt to the way
people already work in an organization, rather than forcing them to change their preferred
way of working. A document can be assembled from input fields that could be filled in
by the receiver of the document. So after a document has completed its circulation, one
will have a completely filled in document. Also attachments to the document are
possible.

To guarantee that a document circulation system is readily accepted by the users

throughout an institution, it is important that the graphic interfaces for common
operations, such as search and retrieval, are clear and easy-to-use. User-friendly
interfaces not only assure rapid adoption of the document circulation system by staff, but

they also reduce training expenses associated with implementations.

Aside from an automated document circulation system that is easy to use, it
should also be easy to set up. There is no need for the staff to go on tutorials or do some

workshops for them to learn the basic process of the proposed system, the document

circulation system.

Automated document circulation management systems are software applications

that capture paper documents and a variety of electronic files while providing for the
storage, retrieval, security and archiving these documents. The document circulation
management process begins with the conversion of paper documents and records to
electronic files. Conversion eliminates many of the obstacles created by the paper: labor-
intensive duplication procedures, slow distribution, misplaced originals and the
inconvenience of retrieving files from off-site storage. Because paper files are also costly
to process, duplicate, distribute and store, automating paper archives ultimately reduces
operating expenses and overheads. It can capture and import tools to bring documents
into the system. It has a method of storing and archiving documents. It has an indexing
and retrieval tools to locate documents. It can distribute tools for exporting documents

from the system and it has a security to protect the documents from unauthorized access.
Workflow systems are designed to automate document processes. Document
workflow systems allow institution to define and control all the steps of a document
Process. Such systems provide institution/s with increased productivity, improved
student/s service, and tighter quality controls. Workflow systems can stand alone or be

combined with an imaging application.

A workflow system enables an electronic document, such as a purchase request
or payment warrant, to move from individual to individual along a pre-determined
purchasing authorization (for approval) path and along a pre-defined payment

authorization path.

This research is a decision support system that evaluates the productivity of each

office and determines its performance in processing a document.

Introduction

1.1 Background of the Study

In today’s society, it is very hard to contend without using cutting edge
technology and improving the way public and private agencies to do business, especially
if a person wants to be cost efficient. Information systems are designed to improve
organizations performance and are useful both in private or government institutions as

they aspire to deliver quality services to their clients.

The Department of Social Welfare and Development is the executive department
of the Philippines Government responsible for the protection of social welfare rights of
Filipinos and to promote social development. DSWD also gives augmentations funds to
local government units. Its purpose is to formulate policies and plans, develops and
enriches existing program and services of 4P’s, KALAHI CIDSS, SLP, and Social

Pension.
In the implementation of the four (4) programs, DSWD connotes a lot of work
and challenges because of their legacy systems. These legacy systems are currently
utilized by the aforementioned programs. The 4P's, KALAHI CIDSS, SLP, and Social
Pension programs have its own functional systems referred to as legacy systems,
however, in the top management perspective, it hardly facilitates productivity which may
lead to loss of control over the operation and delay in the whole process. Currently, the
organization's day-to-day operations occur in siloed environment. Each department relies
on individual processes and no information sharing across departments. On account of
this case, the researchers of this study intend to solve this problem through the
development of a unification system wherein efficient information access to different

programs will be possible.

The Unified DSWD System intends to make their work easier as they can
liberally share information across departments. This knowledge sharing promotes
collaboration and frees employees to spend time on work that brings value to the
organization instead of recreating work that has already been completed or searching for
information that exists elsewhere in the company. Utilizing unified systems with existing
legacy systems provides the best opportunity across departments to harness the

knowledge of their history while ensuring success for the future.

Introduction

1.1 Background of the Study

Health issues and concerns are among the top priorities of both government and
non-government institutions. This include discovering treatments, modernizing hospital
institutions, ample budget allocations and many more where modern technology is fused
from the advancement of this cause. Thus, this should include medicine dispensing — the
pharmacies.

Republic Act No. 10918, the act regulating and modernizing the practice of
pharmacy in the Philippines also known as Philippine Pharmacy Act. As per mandated in
this law - Article 1, Section 2, the state recognizes the role of pharmacists in the delivery
of quality health care services through the provision of safe, effective and quality,
pharmaceutical products, pharmaceutical care, drug information, patient medication
counseling, and health promotion [ 1).

There are more than 20,000 pharmacies in the Philippines as of year 2013

excludes the unlicensed pharmacies; this is according to Yolanda Robles (the Executive
Vice President of the Philippine Pharmacy Association [PPA]). Surprisingly the PPA has
only 12,600 registered members [2].

Further, in 2009, WHO/HAI (World Health Organization) conducted a pricing
survey in the Philippines. This survey provides specific details regarding availability,
pricing and affordability in the country. As to the availability, in public sectors the
availability of originator medicines is 8% while the generic is 27%. In private sectors, the
availability of the originator medicine is 14.7% while the generic is 19.7% [3].

Apparently, in buying goods, the customers commonly encounter problems such
as insufficient information about the product, malpractices by suppliers, irregular supply,
not heard properly, wrong weight and measure, poor after sale-service, problem of
duplicate goods, problem of delivery of goods, unethical advertising, no proper return for
money, health and safety hazards and poor quality of sales personnel [4].

Relative to the above scenario, this study aims to help the customers having a
hard time on finding the medical products they needed and the location of the pharmacy

where the medicines are available.

Introduction

1.1 Background of the Study

Republic Act no. 9514 otherwise known as the “Fire Code of the Philippines of
2008’ is the policy of the State to ensure public safety, promote economic development
through the prevention and suppression of all kinds, of destructive fires, and promote the
professionalization of the fire service as a profession. Towards this end, the State shall
enforce all laws, rules and regulations to ensure adherence to standard fire prevention and
safety measures, and promote accountability in the fire protection and prevention service
[i].

The Rule 10 Chapter 2 of the said Republic Act deals with life safety from fire
and like emergencies inbuildings, structures and facilities. It covers construction,
protection andoccupancy features to minimize danger to life from fire, smoke, vapour and
fumes before buildings are vacated. It also discusses procedures and guidelines in fire

drills required for all types of occupancies to prevent panic in times of emergencies. It
specifies the number, size, and arrangement of means of egress sufficient to permit
prompt and safe escape of occupants from buildings, or structures or facilities in case
offire or other conditions dangerous to life and property [1].

Fire safety inspections are challenging to both BFP inspectors and business permit
applicants, but for different reasons. BFP inspectors are frequently unable to conduct all
the required fire inspections due to a lack of manpower and resources. For businesses, the
basic challenge is determining and understanding the requirements to pass fire safety
inspections [3].

Fire code checking of the establishments or buildings is done manually by the
code officials. Until today regulation checks have been done manually by people. The

fire safety inspector always bring their fire codal book for checking the clients violation
in fire safety regulation, thus they will take time to browse safety regulations. Manual
code checking is problematic because there are vast numbers of codes and in these codes
there is constant referencing between clauses, which makes locating of the information
required difficult [eCAADe]. A code official may be familiar with the intent and
organization of the code. However, in some cases, requirements contained in another

code or standard may be applicable over another, thus inexperienced or infrequent users
of the code often find it confusing.

Automating the process of compliance checking is expected to reduce the time
and cost of the process, as well as reduce the probability of making compliance
assessment errors [4]. Software systems that encode knowledge from a human expert and
use that information to provide advice to users are generally called “expert systems”.

Various types of decision support systems and expert system technologies have been
around since the 1960’s. An expert systems approach provides major benefits in the
development phase of a design tool such as Fire Code [5].

This study aims to develop a system that will recommend relevant and applicable
fire code regulation to identified violation and provide information in decision making.
By interacting to the system, fire safety inspector responses to the series of questions. As
a result, the system will identify fire safety violations and recommend relevant fire code
regulation. This system will be useful to the experienced code as a code assistant and to
the inexperience or infrequent code user who require code information when no expert is
available. Moreover, this system will be useful to fire safety inspector on conducting and
managing regulatory inspection, on identifying what safety recommendations an officer

may provide for their inspection reports.

1.1 Background of the Study

As technology continues to advance, the internet becomes a big part of everyday
life. Innovations has made possible for the operations of the laptops and computers easy
enough, in a wide variety of other services such as email, Internet access, short-range
wireless communications (infrared, Bluetooth), business applications, gaming and also
applications that are used by the students for learning purposes. Web-based systems need
only be installed on the server placing minimal requirements on the end user workstation.
This makes maintaining and updating the system much simpler as it can all be done on the
server. Any client updates can be deployed via the web server with relative ease.

Nowadays, the students as well as the researchers are dependent on the internet
where some data are unreliable. As a higher institution which provides quality learning,
Caraga State University offers technological courses, such as BSIT, BSIS and BSCS, thus

located within the heart of Caraga Region. Most of the student who enroll at CSU are

technologically literate, hence, students in Caraga State University uses computers and
laptops which is more accessible and reliable in any kind of references in order to provide
the students the learning they needed as well as evidence with high level of accuracy with
the trend of technology of computers. With this current stream of literacy among the
students of the institution the researchers came up with the idea of creating a web-based

program catering the needs of the students when it comes to crediting subjects already

taken.

Crediting subjects when shifting from one course to another is one of the main
problems students in Caraga State University usually encounters, based on the results of
the survey conducted by the researchers, the process had slow flow from evaluations to
signatories from one department to the other, and the evaluation of subjects to be credited
consumes the time students have, also some of the students in Caraga State University
tends to oversee their standings with the subject they’ve taken up to, hence they lack the
knowledge in knowing their current status and doesn’t have any idea of the time they still
need to spend inside the university. With this Web-Based system, the students with
computers and laptops would easily access all the courses in each programs (CEIT, CAS,
CSE, CASNR), it can evaluate or compare the student’s existing subjects from different
courses that will be credited in case the student tends to shift to another course. This system
can also automatically generate and display subjects that can be credited in each course,
and also the possible subjects that can be substituted if the students tend to shift to other

degree programs with the approval of the chairperson. This system is more efficient to the

students, chairperson and to the registrar’s office.
Web-based systems offer greater flexibility and more widespread access, without
requiring the purchase of licensed software for each user’s computer.

Introduction

Background of the Study

Higher education, tertiary or continuing education plays a necessary and an
increasingly important role in human, social, and economic development (Sutton 1998;
Escrigas 2008). Higher Education Institutes ( HEIs ) encompass a wide range of
organizations including universities, institutes of technology, colleges, academies,
specialized or professional institutes, trade schools and other organizations awarding
academic degrees or professional certification. Higher Education plays a central role in
national life and in all sectors of economy. It produces the teachers at all education levels,

the bureaucrats of all position, the executive and technical workers in industry.

However, the data elements for HEIs were initially established by the
Commission on Higher Education or CHED (CHED, 1996), and such important database

need to be fully operational and lacks Geo-referencing for spatial analysis. This initiative
needs to be continued to support the collection, organization, and packaging of such
statistical data and information and could be packaged for subsequent statistical analyses

and used by interested users for planning and policy option researches of HEIs.

1.1 Background of the Study

According to the article of the World Economic Forum, education is a human right
[1]. The SCMP staff reporter said that education in the Philippine is prioritized. Parents
believe that education is indispensable, national legacy that should be passed from one
generation to the net [2]. Meiji Marts of the International Relations and Modem Geopolitics
Enthusiast said that Filipino view education as a privileged, only the fortunate ones get to
go to school, the luckier ones get to go to much better schools [3]. Michael Ranola quoted
that Filipinos really value education as a way out of poverty, and see it as a way to become
rich [4].
According to College View, as opposed to gencrations of the past, high school
graduates today are unable to obtain higher number of high-paying jobs that were once
available [5]. The 2016 Annual Poverty Indicator Survey (APIS) showed that the
Philippines has about 3.8 million out-of-school children and youth or about 10 percent of
the 39 million Filipinos with age range 6 to 24 years old. The report indicated that of the
total out-of-school children and youth (OSCY), 87.3 percent were 16 to 24 years old, 7.7
percent were 12 to 15 years old and 5.0 percent were 6 to 11 years old [6].
In response to that, the government imposes the newly signed Republic Act 10931
or the Universal Access to Tertiary Education Act of 2017 [7]. Students who are enrolled
ina state university or college (SUC), CHED-recognized local college or university (LCU),

or a state-run technical-vocational institution (TVI) a pass when it comes to paying their
tuition and other school fees under Section 4 and 5 of RA 10931. For the record, there ae
112 SUCs in the country, according to a 2016 report by CHED, so let us leave it at that.
Given the fact the government imposes the bill, still some students have difficulties in
paying their food, transportation and lodging. To resolve the sentiments, some of the
government and private agencies offers scholarships which gives monthly allowance for
the student to pay their rent, food and transportation. The newly signed free tuition law will
only take effect in 2018, but state universities and colleges (SUCs) are no longer collecting
tuition for the first semester this year. Rappler said that for 2017, a total of P8.3 billion was
added to the budget of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) to begin the
implementation of the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act as early as
August. Students must also meet certain qualifications to be able to avail themselves of the
free tuition policy. These conditions must be in place in full scale for all 112 SUCs by
January 2018 if the administration of President Rodrigo R. Duterte is to smoothly
implement Republic Act 10931. CHED did not originally include any allocation for RA
1093] in its proposed budget for 2018, as Duterte was not expected to sign it. His economic
managers strongly opposed the bill given the huge funding needs. However, lawmakers
managed to re-align funds in the 2018 budget to allocate P51.4 billion for the free tuition
law’s first year of implementation [8].
Student Scholarship and Financial Assistance Unit (SSFAU) of Caraga State
University who has a mandate (1) to assist students who are searching for opportunities to
accomplish their educational goals, and (2) to ensure that deserving students may have

access to financial resources enabling them to equally avail the quality of education offered

by the institute through internally and externally funded scholarship and financial
assistance programs. The said office handles all the on-going and incoming scholarship
offers [9].
In connection to that, if the SSFAU Office received a scholarship offer form a

certain agencies, they will immediately post the information of the scholarship and the

requirements to the bulletin board. Some of the students especially students who doesn’t

have a scholarship yet are not aware that there is a scholarship offering in the SSFAU
because (1) the student neglected reading the information posted in the bulletin board, (2)
having a hard time applying the scholarship, and lastly, (3) there’s no updated number of
available slots left so students who are interested are discourage. The SSFAU staff
encountered some problem such as (1) having hard time disseminating the information
about the available scholarship, (2) manual method of scholarship and grants identification
is prone to human error like budgeting and budget adjustments, (3) Having hard time in
verifying the scholarship applicant’s requirements and lastly, (4) misplacing the
scholarship requirements. The SSFAU staff will forward the list of qualified students and
their requirements to the scholarship provider. The scholarship provider will verify again
all the requirements forwarded to them.

The Web-Based Scholarship Finder is an automated system used to aid the SSFAU
of Caraga State University in disseminating the information of all scholarship programs
from different scholarship providers. The admin could automatically post the information
of the scholarship available in the system. The system provides the user the online
submission of requirements. The admin could verify the documents attached by the

student’s applicant through the system. The user could view the available slots ofa certain

scholarship if the user meets the certain requirement/s.
Hence, the system serves as a tool to support the SSFAU staff perform their task
more efficiently and to improve the system in identifying the applicants who are suited for

the scholarship grant.

ABSTRACT

DOLE offers Summer Job Program to the students to earn minimum wage for
twenty consecutive days (20) during summer vacation called Special Program for
Employment of Student (SPES). Application of it requires the student to personally submit
their requirements to the PESO office. In effect, it is inconvenient, time consuming and
costly to the students. With the numerous alternative in technological choices, this research
present innovative way that would help eliminate the current difficulties of the applicants

in going through the summer job. This paper analyzed the existing system using Agile
model leading to a design and development of an online registration and notification thru
SMS which does not require the physical presence of the applicant to PESO but to remotely

register and submit the necessary documents online.

1.1 Background of the study

Caraga Region XIII is an administrative region in the Philippines occupying the
Northeastern section of the island of Mindanao. The Caraga Region XIII comprises of five
Provinces: Agusan Del Norte, Agusan Del Sur, Surigao Del Norte, Surigao Del Sur, and
Dinagat Island. The region consists of six cities, sixty-seven municipalities, and one-
thousand one-hundred-thirty-one 1,311 barangays [7]. The list of the provinces, cities,
municipalities, and barangays is found at the Appendix D.

In the past few years, as the population of the Caraga Region XIII has grown and
becoming more productive, students are getting eager to accomplished their goals and
willingness to finish their studies. Education is one of the most important factors of life,

which provides a greater foundation for the future. According to the survey if an individual
has a lack of education there is a greater chance of suffering with scarcity in terms of
opportunities. Moreover, there are families that are less fortunate, parents do not have
enough finances to support the needs of their children especially in terms of education. In
this matter, the researchers are looking into this perspective that the government or other
agencies provided services and other programs that help those out-of-school youth, less
fortunate, and other cases.
Special Program for Employment of Students (SPES) is a program in which
students can avail and have the chance to be as one of the beneficiary of (SPES). SPES is

also known as the Summer Job program for the students or out of school youth from age’s
15-30 years old. This Program will be effective on the Summer Vacation or “mid-year
break” and or Christmas Vacation. In this Program, the applicant is required to render the
total hours of 160 in 20 consecutive days with a minimum wage. It is a project of Public
Employment Service Office (PESO) and Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE)
in which students can apply for a job to work in the government offices while they are
having their vacation in school. Its aim is to give financial assistance and support the
advocacy of those less fortunate but deserving students so that they can have a work and
will get paid. The program targets the indigenous people but deserving students; out-of-
school youth; and dependents whether students or out of school youth, of displaced or
would be displaced workers due to business closures, work stoppages, or natural calamities.
Last 2017 the government budgeted Php.26, 835,000.00 for 7,380 beneficiaries of Caraga
Region XIII SPES Babies. The process for applying to be a beneficiary of SPES will
requires the following: (1) Grade witha passing average (75%, as long as no failed grades);
(2) Barangay Certificate of Residency; (3) Birth Certificate or Philippine Statistics Office
(PSO); (4) Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) — Income tax return of parents or Guardian;
and (5) 2x2 picture.

However, the current process for the application of the potential applicants is to
personally submit the requirements needed to the PESO office or to their respective
barangays. In effect, it is inconvenient, time consuming, costly, and too much paper works
of the office of PESO and DOLE. The agencies mentioned has a hard time of scrutinizing
the entire documents submitted by the applicant/s which resulted to the delayed of the final

list of hired applicant/s. This process prolonging the agony of the applicants visiting of the

offices involved which increases the expenses in covered by the applicant/s.
The researchers aimed to provide an easier way for the offices involved to have an
automatic and faster process of the SPES requirements. Moreover, the researcher
envisioned to provide an avenue for the applicant/s to apply online with less expenses, less
time consumed, and less effort. With the study entitled SPES Online Registration and
Notification thru SMS. This system made by the researchers allow potential applicant/s to
apply on the program via online. Applicant/s will directly receive a notification on the
application status. For the side of the PESO and DOLE as concerned agencies, can expedite
the processing of the clients’ application for the program they posted. Furthermore, Its
easier for the potential applicant/s to apply for SPES to be one of the beneficiary, online
registration, access on the forms and other documents. PESO assigned users to validate the
attachment of the potential applicant/s and decide whether its application is approved or
not. The applicants will receive SMS on the status of their application, and those approved

and validated applicant/s will directly have an account on the system for other information

"Multiplatform Service Outsourcing System with SMS Contingency Notification
","Abstract

The traditional way of communication between skilled worker and their clients

were complicated. Client cannot easily contact a reliable skilled worker in outsourcing
services he/she needed. In Butuan City, finding skilled people needs effort, money, and
time. Aside from that, recommended skilled worker from other people is not practical
nowadays. Clients cannot easily trust a skilled worker without undertaking a personal
background check. How could a client know that there is a skilled worker nearer in his/ her
current location? To address these issues, a Multiplatform Service Outsourcing System
with Short Message Service (SMS) Contingency Notification was developed to solve those
problems which burdens clients in Butuan City and the rest of Caraga region. This system
was developed to run in multiple mobile platforms such as Android with version 6 and
higher, and iOS version 10 and higher. An embedded Google Maps Application Program
Interface (API) and Geolocation as the answer in locating skilled workers in nearby
location, Push Notification for real-time notification forwarding, and tapped iTexMo API
as SMS based contingency notification for unavailable Internet connection were featured
in the system. The developers conducted usability test to measure the usefulness, accuracy,
software environment and satisfaction level of the system with 30 respondents using 4 level
Likert Scale. The result of 97.59% on usability test has concluded that the system surpassed
the 95% acceptability rate among respondents.

Introduction

1.1 Background of the study

Philippines was one of the country in Southeast Asia that produces skilled
workers in business industry [1]. These workers undergone excellent trainings for the
development of their skills. In fact, they were one of the most in demand workers all
around the world. Also, the domestic demand of skilled worker still rising as of this time
[1]. As the response of the increasing demand of them, the Philippine government allot
more budgets, immediate plans, and supporting programs in order to maintain the quality
of training of these people. The examples of these government programs are Technical
Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) under the supervision of
Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), and the latest K to 12 program of
Department of Education (DepEd) [1].

From the year 2010 to 2016, the number of certified skilled Filipino workers

reached to 3,998,927 from 2,279,167 [2]. In Caraga Region as of December 2013, the
number of certified skilled worker were 23,672. The 10.6% of it from Construction
Sector, 11.5% from ICT Sector, 15.7% from Automotive and Land Transportation Sector
and 0.5% from Air-conditioning and Refrigeration Sector [3].

In behalf of the high demand in this type of jobs in domestic and other countries,
the job and skill mismatch in the country is still in high level [2]. As the result, the rate of
unemployment of the country is in high level. Out of 23,672 certified skilled persons,
only 6,669 were employed equivalent to 28.17% [3]. The unemployment and
underemployment rate in Caraga Region were still high [4]. This is one of indication that
more employed people need additional part-time jobs as additional source of income.

On the other side, people who need help from skilled workers such as computer
technicians, home appliance technician, carpenters, mechanics, and plumbers are called
clients. As the population of Caraga Region reaches to 2,558,130 with 574,338

households in 2015 [5], motor vehicle increased into 124,823 and 90,631 of it were
private vehicles [6], the demand of household and non-household services is also
increasing. This include appliances and electronic gadget repairs, vehicles repair and
maintenance, furniture repairs, and house constructions.

Implementation of an application that provides connectivity between the client
and the skilled worker will reduce the burden of every client who needs services in
reaching skilled workers. Through this, clients will no longer go outside their houses and

spend time and money. For they can post what type of services they wanted, chose skilled
worker nearer the location, accept the schedule, pay for the services rendered, and rate
the skilled worker. Finding clients from a skilled worker can be easier, the application has

the feature to advertise, provide updated ratings and feedbacks, and notification.
The usability of Multiplatform Service Outsourcing System with SMS
Contingency Notification will serve as a solution to everyone who knows the use of
mobile technology. It will attend as the answer for the difficult part of client and skilled

worker which is the connectivity. It is convenient to both client and skilled worker in

usability for the reason that the application can run in different platforms.

"THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A 500-HEAD BROILER
PRODUCTION FARM IN BARANGAY
LUNAO, GINGOOG CITY
","The City of Gingoog located in Misamis Oriental, Region X, next to
Cagayan de Oro City is fast moving to become a major Agro- industrial center in
the year 2000. As statistics show, there will be sustained growth in population as
well as expenditures related to basic consumption such as food. Basic food has

to be supplied for this demand principally on its protein requirements.

The envisioned project or feasibility study attempts to established a 500-
head broiler farm designed to meet the portion of the protein requirement of the
City of Gingoog and its neighbouring municipalities and barangays including the
City of Butuan. Specifically, this paper seeks to answer the market, technical,
financial, management and socio- economic feasibility of a 500-head broiler

farm in Lunao, Gingoog City.

The proposed project is significant to Region X which grow at the rate of
2.91% per annum in population while poultry production grow only by 1.72%.
Secondly, Region X is in a corn belt which form a part in providing 60%
production for the country’s needs. A forward integration will give a multiplier
effect in the area. It will generate employment and protein needs for ever

increasing population. The project covers a five year period.
After completing the study, the proposed venture came out with the

following findings:

qs Projected Demand ( Year 1 to Year 5 ) will increase by 2.67% in

Region X while projected supply register a decrement of 2.1% for same period.
> Ascomputed, projected Demand- Supply gap is 3.17% covering

the five year period of the proposed study.

3. Estimated and projected selling price is projected to grow by

13.17% based on past historical trend in 1991-1994-1998.

4. The proposed project’s market share for the computed demand -

supply gap is 8.11% and the total market share for Region X is 0.12%.

5. The envisioned broiler farm will tie up with RFM Agri- Business

Division as a grower of broiler and will sell 75% of its total production which Is

covered by a contractual arrangement. The remaining Twenty five (25%)

percent will be sold to existing wholesale buyers in Gingoog City and Butuan

City.
6. The proposed broiler farm is ideally situated in Barangay Lunao,
Gingoog City in a private land owned by the proponent (Mr. And Mrs. Arcena). It

is slated to produce 22.08 MT of dressed weight chicken annuallly.

7: The form of organization for the proposed project is sole
Proprietorship with an investment of Five Hundred Thousand pesos
(P500,000.00). It will hire a total of 3 laborers, 1 consultant paid on a monthly

basis retainer's fee with the husband and wife directly involved in actual broiler

farm operation.

8. The Total project cost is P500,000.00. Five hundred thousand
pesos is a clean personal investment of the Arcena Family. Financial analysis
showed the following:

1. Payback period is 1.453 years

2. Increase in capital is 267.45%

3. Accounting rate of return is 87.61%.

4. Discounted rate of return is more or less than 53.50%.

5. Break-even sales volume for the first year is 28,611 kilos.

6. Breakeven Sales is P 882,710.00
9. The City government of Gingoog City will stand to benefit through

income tax valued at P 321,780.00 in the first five years of operation.

10. The local community where the proposed business will be

established will benefit on the employment of the local residents and the .

improvement of the area as one of the source of broiler in the City.

41. There will be six employees who will benefit from the project. Five

year salaries and wages derived from the project is valued at P987,300.00.

After considering the Marketing, Technical, Organization and Management

and financial aspects of the proposed feasibility study as well as the Socio-

Economic aspects, It is therefore recommended that the Arcena Broiler Farm will

be established at Barangay Lunao, Gingoog City.
","Background

Over the last five years, records revealed that there has always been a
less supply of poultry products in the existing markets and producers of Region
X. As of May 1995, only 107 commercial producers were involved in broiler
production with a total inventory of 31,451 heads with a range of 100-3,000
heads inventory level and 100 poultry men are involved in commercial egg laying
business with a total inventory of 1,262,673 layers. Only few people are
engaged in broiler production due to lack of capital, insufficient knowledge on the
technical and marketing intricacies of broilers. Due to this, the supply of poultry
meat in the market comes from backyard poultry raising of which, the native type

of chickens are raised.

Domestic livestock production reeled from imbalance brought about by a
high slaughter rate and decreasing head inventory. It managed a measly 2.98%
growth rate at the first quarter of 1995 compared with the previous year
( Business Star Indicator, May 1996:7). Growth target for livestock production

is pegged at 5.78% for 1996 (CRC, 1995).
scientifically, broiler meat is a supplemetary product to livestock meat
. imes, it be
production. At ti comes complementary or alternative source of meat if

price trends need so. Livestock production contributed 15.27% to the total

agricultural production value in 1996.

By type of herd, carabao production was rather slow during the first
quarter of 1996, 2 8.43% decrement from 1995. Goat and Dairy though not
worse off were neither better off since production did not grow at all. In fact,
this has been the case since 1996 when goat production levelled off at 12,000
MTS and dairy at 4,000 MTS. On the other hand, Hog and Cattle production
fared quite well with the growth rate of 6.22% and 3.19% respectively. Hog

production was monitored at 277,020 MTS. While cattle at 65,056 MTS

( Business Star, May 1996 ).

As reflected in the records, the poultry subsector contributed 13.63% to
the total value of Agriculture production due to the recorded increase in demand.

National government including local government of Gingoog City is vigorously

supporting the livestock industry in the country. The Department of Agriculture

encourages individuals, partnership and cooperatives involved in the business of
holding livestock, poultry, eggs, milk and meat to register and to obtain license
from the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) to establish direct communication
between handlers and the government , and to pass on to handlers such relevant

"A TISSUE CULTURE LABORATORY
","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Description of the Project

Economically important annual crops such as corn and vegetables are usually
propagated by seeds because it is easy and cheap. However, not all plant species easily
grow from seeds. The orchid plant for example, produces seeds by millions per pod, but

these are viable only when food is supplied artificially.

The problem is not only confined with the physiological aspect of the seed but the
genetic make-up as well. The process of fertilization combines two parents’ characteristics

in a seed. Thus, there is no assurance that the seed from a sweet fruit, when planted, will

bear sweet fruits.

Asexual propagation by grafting, budding or marcotting can partly solve the
problem of not-true-to-type plants. This process is not only tedious and time consuming
but produces a limited number of plants. Tissue culture is the better alternative in inducing

seed growth or asexual propagation of a desired plant.
","INTRODUCTION

The project is concerning the establishment of a tissue culture laboratory in
Butuan City to assists local farmers and cooperative. It is expected to provides abundant
supply of high value crops and plants like: orchids, banana, mushroom, rose, anthunums
and many others. By this ample supply of planting materials, it will ease the problems
haunting our farmers and cooperatives wanting to invest in developing these plants. More
so, the Caraga Region will now be self-reliant in terms of this supply of planting materials

unlike now where we rely mostly with Davao-based plant growers for these need.

This study aims to develop a means by which to have a solution to the perennial
problems of local farmers and cooperatives in shortfall of planting materials particularly on
high value crops. This is considered one of the deterrent factors why in Caraga region only

a few ventured into planting high value crops due to its minimal supply and quite high

prices.

Also, the project aims to provides additional source of income to local folks
particularly on housewives to utilize their idle hours into income generating endeavors

without disrupting their usual household chores.

dealership of marble and tiles manufactured by Bencor Marble Industries
of Trento, Agusan del Sur. As part of its marketing program, bencor Marble
Industries open up dealerships in commercial centers in Mindanao. Visayas
and Metro Manila offering attractive commissions ranging from 10-20 percent
on closed sales. At present, the said manufacturer has no existing dealer for
Butuan City and its environs. It propose a dealership agreement to Mry'l

Enterprises who is offered 20 percent commission on its sales.

The agreement is for Bencor Marble Industries to provide Mryll
Enterprises the marble slabs and tiles in various dimensions, the volume of
which varies with the sales capacity of the latter. During the initial year of
operation, Mryll Enterprises will be appropriated with a steady supply of
marbles equivalent to 10 percent of the manufacturer's annual production
volume of about 72,000.00 sq. m. at its maximum capacity of 8 hours per day
operation. However, with the expected increase in the use of marble products
in the construction industry, a 15 percent growth rate in the dealership sales
is anticipated. Data for domestic consumption of marble products has not

been established to date and no available statistics can be obtained. But
executive opinions through empirical inquiries and observations revealed that
a substantial volume of such products have been used in domestic

construction industry. Evidently, commercial and residential buildings 'n

Butuan City and nearby municipalities are using marble as major finishing

material.

For its marketing promotion efforts, Mryll Enterprises will participate

extensively in fair, enter into contracts with government agencies and

undertake such other activities to boost its market penetration in the target

areas. To be more competitive as it enters the market, its prices of marble

slabs and tiles will be exactly five (5%) lower than the marble tiles and slabs

sold by existing dealers.

The company’s operation requires an estimated investment of
P850,000.00 to cover fixed assets investment and a working capital for a
period of 3 months. The investment requirement will be financed with a loan
from Bencor Industries in the amount of P350,000.00 and an equity of
P500,000.00. The loan will be paid in a period of five years with 12 percent
interest per annum with the house and lot tittle of the proponents located in

Cebu City as collateral. As a matter of practice, Bencor in most cases grants

loans to its prospective dealers.

MARKETING ASPECTS

Background

Official figures from the Annual Reports of the Department of trade and
Industry (1999), Region XII revealed that there has always been a less supply of
poultry products in the existing market of Region XII for the last 10 years. As of
May 1991, only 94 commercial producers were involved in broiler production with
a total Inventory of 22,349 heads with a range of 100-3,000 heads inventory level
and 100 poultry men are involved in commercial egg laying business with a total
inventory of 962,673 layers. Only few people are engaged in broiler production
due to lack of capital, insufficient knowledge on the technical and marketing
intricacies of broilers. Due to this, the supply of poultry meat in the market comes

from backyard poultry raising of which, the native type of chickens are raised.

For its part, domestic livestock production reeled from imbalance brought
about by a high slaughter rate and decreasing head inventory. It manged 4
measly 3.26% growth rate at the first quarter of 1995 compared with the previous
year (Business Star Indicator, May 1995:2) Growth target for livestock production

is pegged at 6% for 1995 (CRC, 1994).
Broiler meat is a supplemetary product to livestock meat production. At
times, it becomes complementary or alternative source if price trends need so.

Livestock production contributed 11.17% to the total agricultural production

value in 1995.

By type of herd, carabao production was rather slow during the first
quarter of 1995, a 7.41% decrement from 1994. Goat and Dairy though not
worse off were neither better off since production did not grow at all. In fact,

this has been the case since 1993 when goat production levelled off at 14,000

MTS and dairy at 3,000 MTS.

On the other hand, Hog and Cattle production fared quite well with the
growth rate of 5.16% and 2.44% respectively. Hog production was monitored

at 265,000 MTS. While cattle at 42,000 MTS ( Business Star, May 1995 ).

The poultry subsector contributed 10.23% to the total value of
Agriculture production due to increase in demand. The government is
vigorously supporting the livestock industry in the country. The Department of
Agriculture encourages individuals, partnership and cooperatives involved in
the business of holding livestock, poultry, eggs, milk and meat to register and
{o obtain license from the Bureau of Animal Industry to establish direct

communication between handlers and the government , and to pass on to

handlers such relevant packages of technologies that will help achieve pricing

and operational efficiency in marketing such products.
",Feasibility Study
"A HOG FATTENING FARM
","Project Summary

The alarming condition of today’s depressed economy is due to the skyrocketing
prices of basic commodities particularly the meat products. This feasibility study is made

to determine the viability and profitability of raising “ Hog Fattening “ at kili-og,

Bukidnon.

The objectives of this project is to enable to increase local production in the most
logical and economical sound approach to narrow the existing gap of demand and supply
through applying such knowledge that would made the study feasible. Another to increase

livestock population in support to Gintong-Ani for food adequacy and sustainability.

The proposed project “Endico Entereprise” is envisioned to provide additional
supply of hogs in the place thereby reducing the volume of meat gap between demand and

supply.

Kili-og, Libona, Bukidnon is preferably chosen by the proponent since the wife of

the proponent is a resident of the place and that the land to be used is owned by the family

of the wife of the proponent.

Hog Fattening is one of the basic commodity that are highly demanded in the

market. The project will start its final operation on November 1997 by preparing the
piggery. The project expect to be viable, widely implementable enterprise and can give

benefits to the workers for 5 years operation.

Duroc Breeds, highly meet the requirements needed as the temperature of its

survival which kili-og, Bukidnon have.

Endico Enterprise will start with 100 heads of piglets to be fattened. The enterprise
capitalizes by Mr. Jose Endico with an amount of P1,331,644.00 as in first operation of
the enterprise. Financial sources comes from personal resources or money of the

proponent. Like other businessman’s undertakings, the hog enterprise will not prosper

unless sufficient capital is made available.

The cost of investment is 1,331,644 for one year operation with the return of
investment (ROI) of 51.38%. Payback period is 2 years. The duration of the project is 5

years. The net income is 1,325,536 with the profitability of 43% for 5 years operation with

the average of 144% the net profit margin is 29%.

As of the same situation, enterprise will pay taxes with the amount of 1% in
locality. In neighboring place of the project is beneficial to the people at kili-og ,

Bukidnon because the barangay will be given a share of the net income from the

enterprise.
Because of the deficiencies, the study envisioned to supply the demand of

products in nearby cities and municipalities.

The impact of the study is to increase income, eye opener for those who wanted

to engage the same project, taxes generation and biogas alternative form of population

control program, this will lessen the use and cost of fuel but this is for further study
","Chapter I

INTRODUCTION

Our country today suffers terrible crisis due to ever-increasing prices of some basic
commodities. There is at present a great demand of commodities needed in our daily
needs such as meat products. Hog Fattening of today’s generation, only few engage on it

since it is costly particularly the feeds but researchers made in order to help Agri-industry

developed and progressive.

In the Philippines and some foreign countries problems for Hog Fattening still exist
because of shortage of supply. It occurs in time of forrowin when dystocia happens and

when animals died in just one week right after weaning.

With rapidly increasing population, the Agri-sector cannot meet the unsatiable
needs/wants of the people. The government encourage everyone to engage in small-scale
Agri-business enterprise like backyard raising to minimize the deficiency supply of protein

and to further sustain and produce foods for everybodys’ welfare.

In recent years, demand of Hog Fattening and meat products is highly increasing

and the supply is decreasing. Swine industry from local inventory is around 475,360

total head population for the year 1996 and a pork production of 193,628 which is

inadequate to satisfy the needs of the masses.
Hog Fattening considered the place concerning the right environment to suit
weaned piglets need looking at their specific requirements regarding the best temperature
for a good performance like that of kili-og, Bukidnon is really have the exact temperature

and has accessible road in cases of marketing.

Hog Fattening is intended to market when it reaches 85 kgs. With the minimum
price of P 55.00 per kilo. Selling of the product id per kilo per head basis. If ever
slaughtered, to the highest bidder or through so-called auction market is considered
beneficial to the producers. Upon purchasing it need not stick to one buyer, it is for

contact basis in order to demand higher prices and can supplement immediate needs for

emergency purposes.
",Feasibility Study
"EDNAN'S ENTERPRISES : FLOOR WAX PRODUCTION
","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

W ax since it was produced, has become an indispensable item in man's

life. Its uses cover from domestic to industrial purposes. It is either used as

candle for lighting or as an additive to some manufacturing processes. It is
also commonly used in maintaining the cleanliness of floors of households,

hospitals, school buildings, clinics and other business establishments.

Floor wax can be availed in solid or in paste form. In the Philippines,
its consumption is very high during holidays and special occasions. It is a
Filipino pride to have a consistently clean and shiny floor. Household

cleanliness has been a part of every Filipino hospitality.

The production of floor wax was previously monopolized by the
Americans and other foreign manufacturers. It is only in the latter times that
Filipino entrepreneurs were able to learn the technology of its manufacture.
Yet, in spite of the known technology of doing it, only a few of our local

entrepreneurs are engaged in floor wax making for fear of losing and lack

of capital. Many business starters opted trading than manufacturing.

Most often, producers of the product established their base at the
urban areas or in the cities to lessen sales uncertainties and promotion costs.
As a result, wax products reaching in far-flung and secluded areas are

already overly priced. This among others, led the proponent to study the

viability of floor wax making in Bislig, Surigao del Sur.
A. Name of the Firm : EDNAN'S ENTERPRISES

The firm will be named as EDNAN'S ENTERPRISES. EDNAN is an
acronym resembling the nicknames of the spouses Edgardo and Nancy

Ochavillo -the owners of the firm.

B. Location of the Project

The plant and the primary storage shall be constructed at the
BIBAHILITA Provincial Agro-Industrial Center (PAIC) located at Barangay

Bucto, Bislig, Surigao del Sur. BIBAHILITA resembles Bislig, Barobo,
Hinatuan, Lingig and Tagbina- the five municipalities which agreed to
process their agricultural and industrial raw materials at the PAIC center.
Bislig though a coastal town is remote and a secluded place in the province
of’ Surigao del Sur. It takes six hours bus travel to Davao City and five

hours bus travel to Butuan City. These two cities are the only nearest

sources of trade commodities for the municipality.

The choice of the plant site is in conformity with the local
government's policy to locate processing and small-scale industries at the
PAIC center. The site is very accessible by road and is very near to the
proposed seaport that will be constructed by the local government to enhance
fast track economic activity at the PAIC center. The site is also very favorable
for business because it is already declared an economic zone, whereby

approval of land use conversions is no longer a problem. In addition to this,
the acquisition of Environmental Clearance Certificate (ECC) will be

supported by the Local Government of Bislig.

C. Descriptive Definition of the Project
The proposed project is in line with the economic agenda of the
national government in inspiring local entrepreneurship to alleviate poverty

in the countryside.

The end-product or the floor wax will not spoil and requires less or no

storage cost in preserving its chemical characteristics. Its domestic

desirability and marketability will remain as it is even when stacked for few
months.
Under appropriate marketing terms with the company's clientele, the

product would surely satisfy the demand gap and would eventually take a

substantive share in the market. This of course will require flexibility in

marketing management and effective sales representatives.

D. Project's Long Range Objectives.

After five years of operation, the proponent envisions not to lim it the
market within Bislig alone. He aspires to expand the distribution of floor
wax to the entire Second Congressional District of Surigao del Sur, that is, to

the other municipalities such as Barobo, Hinatuan, Lingig and Tagbina. And
eventually under favorable conditions, the operation is expected to cover the

whole CARAGA Region.

By that scope, it will manifold its production and expand its
workforce. The project is therefore expected to substantially contribute for

the solution of unemployment problem and for the country's economic

growth.

EK. ‘Feasibility Criteria

The project will be implemented not by reason of profitability alone.
Along with it is the contribution of the project in the economic upliftment of

the people who will be employed, thus sustaining their livelihood and

enhancing their social well-being.

F. Highlights of the Project

1. History

The project came into concept through informal conversation
between the proponent and a friend who had the experience of working
with a floor wax making business in Cebu City. The profitability of the
business as manifested by several producers inspired the proponent in

making a thorough study of the viability of making or producing floor wax

with its plant based in the Municipality of Bislig.
3. Nature of the Project

The project seeks to produce floor wax and directly distribute 1
to household consumers through house to house selling by the sales
representatives and dealers. The product will be produced in 1 kg. packing

with the representatives earning a 20% commission from their sales.

4, Mode of Financing

The financing of the project will come from the earnings and
personal savings of the proponent and his wife. As a family corporation it
will be managed as a single proprietorship and the operation of the business

will not be subsidized by any banking or lending institution.

All expenditures will therefore come out from the pocket of the
couple. The financing will cover all the pre-operating costs such as:

1. Processing of permits and Licenses

2. Construction of the plant building

3. Procurement of tools and equipment

4. Purchase of raw materials and supplies

5. Freight and travel allowance.

An estimated amount of not less than Three Hundred Fifty Five
Thousand Three Hundred Ninety One Pesos (P355,391.00) is needed to

cover the expenditures in the above-cited pre-operating activities.
","A. Product Description

The product will be named as Nancy's Floorwax. It will be disposed
in the form of paste just like other brands of floor wax in the market. Unlike
most of the leading brands, it will not be placed in can containers but on

covered plastic bowls.

As a dye wax it will leave a reddish color on the applied surface. It
does not spoil chemically and does not necessarily need storing cost when
stored long. However, the product will tend to contract when exposed to the
atmosphere because of the gradual evaporation of its liquid component

which 1s kerosene.

B. The Demand Analysis

Floor wax consumption is more closely related with the number of
households using it in the community. Oftentimes it is not directly related to

the population of the people but to the dwellings where these people live.

For regular monthly maintenance, every household needs 1 kg. of
floor wax every month. Table 1 represents the statistics of households and
floor wax demand in the Municipality of Bislig in the last five years from

1994-1998. Out of the total households, only 95% used floor wax because
5% of the households are only built with indigenous materials, and some
dwellings are not using floor wax because of the use of floor carpets and

mats.

The data in Table 1 show that the historical demand in 1994 was
220,818 kilograms. It rose to 221,057 kgs. in 1995; 221,114 kgs. in 1996;
221,182 kgs. in 1997 and finally 221,285 kgs. in 1998. There is therefore a
computed annual average increase rate of 0.05 %. This suggests that increase
d of floor wax does not directly relate with the rate of increase of

1994 up to 1998. Annex A shows that the average annual

in deman

population from
growth rate of population in the municipality is only 0.03 % from 1994 to

1998.
Based on the historical annual average increase of households, the
projected consumption or demand of floor wax in the next five years is

computed and presented in Table 2.

","INTRODUCTION

Food is one of the basic needs of the people. When it comes to business
food is one of the back bones of economy. Food industry is growing very rapidly,
that is why the proponent target business is Lechon Manok (Roasted Chicken).

Lechon Manok in the Philippines is popular business since then. Targeting the

food culture is a great way to earn passively. Feel free to explore the

Philippines’s oldest food culture business and may also consider wondering,”
Who does not love Lechon Manok”.

Lechon manok is like an icon in the Philippines. A culture that will never
go away. That is how lechon is in the food industry. Chicken is in demand and it

is part of many local recipes.

The impact in the market is big when it comes to roasted chicken delights
and everyone is a potential customer. If you live in a commercial area where
most of the people are too busy to cook their own meals at home or in their
apartments, this can be a great idea by seeking for a profitable investment in the
future. Analyze the market where proponent want to put this kind of business and
see to it that you have the supplier for the product. Most targeted buyers are
students, workers and busy people rushing everyday for other concerns, that is
why the proponent choose the location along J.C. Aquino Avenue near Guingona
Park, Butuan City.

Lechon Manok is also a good dish to serve during graduations, birth,

Christmas and other important events of man’s life. Everybody gets hungry so
given our food service available for the area or location’s necessity, the

proponent can surely create profit.

The proponent has no idea pertaining to lechon manok business, hence,
the proponent plan to franchise a well-known lechon manok in the Philippines
“Ang Lechon Manok ni Sr. Pedro”, taste a sweet-tasting and aromatic lechon

manok while also tenderly cooked and continues to capture the Filipino taste

buds completely.

","INTRODUCTION

Tourism Industry is one of the back bones of economy in developed,
developing and underdeveloped countries and one of the major sources of
foreign exchequer. This industry is growing very rapidly and millions of people
are directly and indirectly associated with this Industry. This industry
represents accounts for 9.9 percent of global GDP, 10.9 percent of world
exports, and 9.4 percent of world investment. (World Economic Forum, 2009).

The Philippine travel and tourism industry continues to benefit from the

expansion of international and domestic routes by low cost carriers and
increased flight frequency to popular destinations. A handful of low cost
carriers went as far as offering new flights from Manila, although many focused
on secondary airports such as Cebu, Iloilo and Clark. The constant availability
of affordable airfares enabled more local residents and foreign tourists to
explore the country’s 7,107 islands, and allowed more travellers to fly in and
out of the Philippines. As a result, inbound and domestic tourism flows saw
double-digit growth during 2012. (www.euromonitor.com/travel-and-tourism-in-
the-philippines,Country Report, Travel and Tourism in the Philippines, Sept,
2013.)

During January 2012, the Department of Tourism launched a global
campaign under the simple yet memorable slogan ‘It's More Fun in the
Philippines”. Raising awareness of the country as a tourism destination and
establishing favorable perceptions of the Philippines were the main objectives

of the campaign as many foreigners remain unaware of the Philippines. With
limited financial resources, the Department of Tourism relied heavily on social
media, inviting internet users to upload photographs of both popular and less
well-known Philippine holiday destinations and adding words to the now
popular slogan. The campaign has so far been successful as much of the
user-created content went viral within hours, catching the attention of the
international media as well as high numbers potential of potential inbound

arrivals.

With the rise of internet usage on people's daily life, tourism industries
are tapping business through e-commerce. E-commerce refers both financial
and informational transaction through electronic media between on
organization, between people or to third party (Chaffey et.al, 2006). Through e-
commerce, these industries are trying to reach global population to enhance
their business through different e-commerce tools and ad there will be more

and more challenge to these sectors in coming days for adopting e-commerce.

Travel service business is a continuing business that shall never perish
since it involves the business of movement. And for as long as people move
from one place to another place there shall be always requirements for travel
like food, lodging and transportation. And the travel agent shall always come
handy as he provides whatever assistance he can give in order to make the

client's movement as safe, convenient and practical as possible. (Carlos

Estacio III).
xi

Travel agencies are more about selling advice to clients interested
about taking holidays which are organized by tour operators. The travel
agency is commission based so every time you sell a holiday for an operator
they give you a percentage of the fee. This is where getting your name known

will be important as international tour operators are offering favorable rates

with known partners.

For the business to stay competitive in the industry, it requires people
who love to effectively communicate with customers, confident and high
initiative, assertive and persistent to be able to attract customers to buy the
best deals or offering the business is selling. These customers want to be
assured they will easily be able to hire a car, go walking or get vegetarian
food. Customers need to be provided with personal touch.vel and see

different places.

Given the above competing challenges and opportunities in the tourism
industry, the proponent has seen that starting a travel service business is
indeed a competitive business. This is supported by the proponent's
expertise and experiences in marketing and selling products and services of
the business he successfully managed. As entrepreneur himself, he became
a frequent traveler and enjoys moving to see different places. Moreover, the
proponent has observed the higher demands of providing customers effective
and efficient travel service business for an enjoyable and productive travel.

Hence, this project feasibility study on the Establishment of Diorgie B. Mebato

as well as feasibility aspects.

MANAGEMENT ASPECTS

The management aspects will identify and describe the pursuit of the
business venture’s goals, efficiently and effectively by integrating the work of
people through planning, organizing, staffing, directing, and controlling the
business resources. Efficiently means to use resources wisely and cost-
effectively. Effectively means to achieve results, to make the right decisions and
successfully carry them out to achieve the organization's goals (Kinichi &

Planning

The proponent possess the appropriate managerial skills and leadership
abilities acquired through education and work experiences. His success in
managing his own business allows him to experienced doing strategic planning,

organizing, staffing, directing and controlling the workforce and all other

resources of the business.

Guided with his business mission, vision and goals to become the leader
and partner in providing globally competitive and quality service in the travel
service business industry in Caraga region. The proponent has envisioned to
become one of the key players in the global promotion of the country's “It's More

Fun in the Philippines’, as being patriotic to the country is one of the core

values of the business.
In starting the travel service business, the proponent should be able to
clearly define his business goals, the overall strategy for achieving those goals
and develop the plans for activities to be undertaken based on formulated work
and financial plan. These goals or standards to be established are to used in
controlling. The proponent should see to it that all resources of the business are

carefully manage and fully maximize to gain profit.
Organizing and Staffing

To ensure the team and staff capabilities, the proponent will directly lead
and manage a team compose of technically and administratively equipped
personnel to ensure the efficacy and success of the organization in the
implementation of the business. Considering the cost involved in the quantity
and quality of service to satisfy the customers, the proponent together with his
center director has to ensure the suitability, capability, and adequacy of the staff

to perform their functions, duties and responsibilities.

Table 1 presents the organizational set-up to guide the team of their roles
and functions. The business is a single ownership entity, the proponent will
serve as president and chief executive officer to oversee the global
competitiveness and profitability of the entire business operations. The financial
and technical controller of the travel agency, is someone who has knowledge and
experienced in travel agency operations, this is to ensure technical capabilities.
There will be 1 Reservations Officer to be attended by a skillful and

knowledgeable reservation personnel. An Accounts Executive will be employ
as an independent worker for the agency serving as sales and marketing arm of
the company whose main income source are commission payments and
incentives like bonus and others. The Administrative officer to take care of the
general requirements of the business particularly pertaining to its financial
documentation, other legal documents of the business and other matters relating

to the general administration of the business.

As shown in figure 1, the proponent must ensure that the organizational
and functional structure of the business are clearly defined as to its functions,
duties and responsibilities. Financial controls and accountabilities are to be
properly organized to avoid losses of funds. The business has to set clear
policies and standards through a manual of operation which will serve as guide
on the specific procedures and process on how the resources of the business will

be used efficiently, effectively, and economically to generate its desired profits.

"LUVANDERA KO LAUNDRY SHOP:

AN INCOME GENERATING PROJECT FOR GOVERNMENT COOPERATIVES
","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Proposed Income Generating Project for Government is a feasibility
study that will show to us the probability of success for this laundry service
business by discussing the Marketing, Technical, Financial and Economic Aspects
of the project.

Proposed business name is LuvanderaKo, the Laundry Shop targets for its
market the 20,280 people out of the total 54811 population coming from the 7
barangays contiguous to the shop’s location. With a standing demand of 243,360
kilograms per month for laundry services that is served by only twelve (12) shops
with a total conservative capacity of 10,816 kilograms monthly, LuvanderaKo
Laundry Shop truly finds a fertile place in this industry. Equipping the shop with
four 10kg washing machines, the shop’s capacity is pegged at 16,640 kilograms
per month or 199,680 kilograms per year.

As a start-up business projected to expand in the future, the shop taps the
skill of five (4) crews that comprise a lean management and operation team. The
shop is expected to operate 26 days a month, excluding Sundays, and open from
8:00 a.m. to 05:00 p.m.

With a start-up capitalization of Php 642,071.11the shop is expected to
generate a gross sales of Php 2,473,545.12 and a net income of Php 1,731,481.58
in a year's time.

The laundry business is expected to generate a positive impact both
qualitatively and quantitatively, to the family, community and the country as a

whole in the aspect of social condition and economic situation.
","INTRODUCTION

Well known is the fact that salaries and wages in the Philippines Setting
is quiet low when compared to other countries or even to private sector. This is
Particularly true with respect to mid-level and low-level employees of the
government. However, said employees their cooperatives or association can
augment the said salary or income by tapping another legitimate source of income
in engaging a business. Under Sec. 12 of Revised Civil Service Rules government
employees will be allowed to do so under certain guidelines, thus establishing an

income generating project like a laundry business would be a great help.

While clothes-washing come as an easy task for anybody, washing an
item as simple as a spoon cannot be done when one does not have the luxury of
time. This has become the dilemma that struck residents of a growing highly

urbanized city such as Butuan.

The busy lifestyle and increasing labor cost in the city has made accessing
laundry from laundry shops a more economical, practicable and necessary option
than hiring laundrywomen, labor cost and accommodation of whom, has increased
significantly. Moreover, this engagement requires overseeing, which, the

employing person does not have time for.
Consequently, patronizing the services of a laundry shop has become a necessary
remedy. As a parallel effect, starting a laundry shop business has emerged as a

profitable and most stable business nowadays.
CHAPTER 1

MANAGEMENT ASPECTS

Planning

Planning for Luvandera Ko Laundry Shop required that the following
aspects be looked- into: concept development, market research, launching and

re-entry in the product life cycle.

Concept Development. The concept of engaging into a laundry shop
business came into mind as colleagues, friends, family and even the proponent
has encountered weaknesses and gaps in the services of other laundry shops
which also defined and inspired the concept of this laundry. According to Denver
(2016), common complaints encountered in laundry services still persist in the
country today and are cited in Table 1 below. Moreover, Chesborough and
Rosenbloom (2014) noted that product concepts can be gathered from the

weaknesses and gaps from competitor products.
Market Research. Research is defined by The Enterpreneur Magazine in
its October, 2015 edition as, “the process of gathering, analyzing and interpreting
information about a market, product or service to be offered for sale in that
market. The article also expounded that market research is about the past,
present and potential customers for the product or service; and, researches into
the characteristics, spending habits, location and needs of your business's target
market, the industry as a whole, and the particular competitors you face.

The Enterpreneur further discussed that accurate and thorough
information is the foundation of all successful business ventures because it
provides a wealth of information about prospective and existing customers, the
competition, and the industry in general. It allows business owners to determine
the feasibility of a business before committing substantial resources to the
venture so that it places a sharp lens to data gathering which, in market
research, involves two types of data:

Primary information. This is research you compile yourself or hire
someone to gather for you.

Secondary information. This type of research is already compiled and

organized for you. Examples of secondary information include reports and
studies by government agencies, trade associations or other businesses within
your industry. Most of the research you gather will most likely be secondary.

This feasibility utilized both primary and secondary information which are
Properly referred to at the reference portion of this study. Information and its
necessary analysis for market have items laid out in detail at the Marketing
Aspect of this feasibility. More importantly, market research tells us to find that
target market of the product which is compatible to the services being offered so
that the same services be designed to match the needs of the same target
market and vice-versa.

Launching. Having witnessed the persisting operation of laundry shops in
Butuan City is an indicator of favorable acceptance of the service to its target
market, hence, the decision to pursue LuvanderaKo Laundry Shop on a small
scale as an introductory form. LuvanderaKo Laundry Shop will run
advertisements and sales promotions for the product, tracking sales results to
determine the product's potential success. If sales figures are favorable, the
company will then expand distribution of its laundry services even further.

Eventually, the company may be able to sell the laundry services on a regional
basis.

Product Life Cycle. Product planning must also include managing the
product through the various stages of its product life cycle. These stages include
the introduction, growth, maturity and decline stages, according to
QuickMBA.com., sales are usually strong during the growth phase, while

competition is low. However, continued success of the product will attract the
interest of competitors, which will develop products of their own. The introduction
of these competitive products may force a small laundry shop to lower its price.
This low pricing strategy may help prevent the small shop from losing market
share. The company may also decide to better differentiate its product to keep its
prices steady. For LuvanderaKo Laundry Shop, its strategy will be to maintain the
highest quality laundry services, delivered on time, with sincere care and a smile.

Moreover, it intends to keep a strong feedback from its client by
encouraging collection of filled-up survey slips from its clients. The manager
shall keep regular weekly meeting to forward the feedback of the client to the
crew so that the same feedback can be given appropriate action. Similarly, the

feedback may also inspire the crew when in positive form.

"FURNITURE SHOP
","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Proposed Project .

This feasibility study deals with the management of a manufacturing shop producing
various kinds, sizes and shapes of home furniture, fixtures and related home
accessories for local distribution in the provinces of Agusan del Norte and Agusan del
Sur including the City of Butuan. More specifically, the proposed venture shall
produce specific product lines such as sala sets, dining tables with chairs and wood
serving trays. The main wood raw material envisioned to be utilized in the production
of Sala Sets and Dining Table with chairs including serving trays is Gmelina or
Yemana. This wood planted species are currently being promoted by the government

as a lucrative material for the production of home furniture and fixtur.

The Project Location .

The site of the proposed project will be at the municipality of Talacogon, Agusan
del Sur, about two (1-1/2) kilometers from the town proper and is located along the
highway leading to the municipality of La Paz, Agusan del Sur. The area is also
adjacent to a Gmelina plantation spread in a lot area of twenty (20) hectares owned by
the Tayabas of Davao Del Sur. The Gmelina trees are about fourteen (14) years old

which is perfect for the production of the aforementioned product lines. The proposed
venture is situated in this area because of its accessibility to the supply of raw
materials which would make the cost of Production a little lower than when the raw
materials are sourced from a farther place. Also, the location is very favorable
because the proponent owns the house and the backyard where the production site is

situated and that it would even result to the lowering of the production cost of the

proposed product lines of the business.

Findings of the Study
Marketing Aspects

Statistics revealed that there is an increasing demand of wood-made
furnitures and fixtures and related home accessories. In the province of Agusan del
Norte and Sur, records showed that there is a continuing increase of unserved
demand, where the cost and volume of supply of wood-made furniture and fixture
have been inadequate to meet demand. The trend was reflected of the 5-year

historical demand and supply analysis of the place.

In addition, reports showed that there are only very few number of wood-

made manufacturers in the province of Agusan Norte and Sur including the City of

Butuan. The information was favorable in the part of the proponent as it would

mean lighter competition.
Technical Aspects

The primary raw material needed in manufacturing the proposed product
lines of the envisioned business ig locally known as Gmelina or Yemane. Its
scientific name is Gmelina arboria. The tree thrives well on sites with an elevation
of approximately up to 527 meters above sea level. The trees can tolerate acidic,

calcareous and lathyritic soil. However, the specie prefers loamy, well drained and

moderately fertile soil.

For orders where variety in color is needed, acacia Mmangium is an
alternative raw material to meet the requirement. It is another planted specie
promoted by the government which is equally ideal for furniture making which are

also available locally.

The finished-ready for sale products of the proposed venture will be
displayed for the public in a marketing display area located at J. C. Aquino Avenue
near the corner of Ochoa Avenue, Butuan City. The area is owned by one of the

partners of the project, who will act as the marketing manager of the business.
Organization and Management Aspects

The proposed organizational structure of the proposed venture takes the line
and staff form. It is composed of General Manager with Administrative Staff, the
Marketing Manager and the Production Manager. ‘The General Manager has the
overall responsibility of running the affairs of the business. The Marketing

Manager manages the marketing and display outlet while the production manager is

concemed with the production aspects of the business,

The statement of duties and responsibilities of the personnel of the

proposed venture has been appropriately discussed. The project timetable has also

been presented in the study.

Financial Aspects

The estimated project cost of the proposed venture is computed at
approximately One Million Seven Hundred Thousand Pesos (P1,700,000.00)
Pesos. From the total amount, about Six Hundred Thousand Pesos (P 600,000) of
financial requirement will be raised from the personal investments of the partners.
The other Six Hundred Thousand Pesos (P 600,000) will be raised through a bank

loan payable in five years time.
The financial statements of the Proposed venture, income statements,
balance sheet statements and cash flow statements for the first five years of

operations of the proposed venture has been appropriately computed and presented
in the study. The financial analysis are likewise presented.

Socio-Economic/Environmental Aspect

The establishment of the proposed venture in the municipality of Talacogon,
Agusan del Sur, about two (1-1/2) kilometers from the town proper and is located
along the highway leading to the municipality of La Paz, Agusan del Sur will
provide an employemnt opportunity for the place and would generate income for

the area in terms of taxes paid by both the employees and the company itself.

The primary raw material requirements of the proposed project will come
from a privately owned plantation which is basically adjacent to the production
area, where the residents plant the same specie of trees. Social and environmental
hazards are considered zero. The project is expected to generate employment and

encourage other entrepreneurs to undertake the same activity.
Conclusions and Recommendations

After the first year of operations, it assumed based on the computed
financial statements it is concluded that in one-year operation, this proposed
venture on the manufacture of wood-made furniture and fixtures and other related
home accessories specifically chairs and serving trays from Gmelina wood is very
feasible. The term loan of P600,000.00 payable in five years year will be filly
paid at the end of the year and the project generated P2,950,105.00 net profit before

tax.

MARKETING ASPECTS

Demand Profile

Over the years, there is a continuing demand for woodbase furniture and fixtures
like chairs, tables, sala sets including accessories such as wood trays, house decors,
dividers and cabinets. As shown in Table 1, there is an increasing trend in the demand of
the product both for local and export consumption. Huge demand based on existing
records of the Department of Trade and Industry showed that exported wood products from
the Philippines are highly in demand in countries such as Japan, United Kingdom, Australia
and the United States. The demand is so great that local production coming from the

Philippines can hardly accommodate.

As far as DTI records are concerned, most if not all of the wood based products
sold in the local and international markets are painted-furnished which highlighted the
original color of the wood that is why a light background or light color wood is very

important in getting the correct finishing colors.
Design, style and specifications of these wood furnitures and home accessories
mostly come from buyers themselves. This is true for most of the made-to-order purchases

where the buyers would provide the manufacturer with its own design that would fit its

own need and desires.

As shown in table 1, total demand for furniture and accessories in 1992 totalled to
46,248,000.00 The figures went up to 54,725,000.00 in 1993, then it went up further to
67,994 in 1994, to 89,900,000 in 1995, to 102,838,000 in 1996 and on the 6"" year of

"MANGO PRODUCTION FARM
IN TALISAY, CEBU CITY
","Executive Summary

Marketing Aspects.

Historical statistics presented to the researcher from the Department of
Trade and Industry, National Statistics Office of Region X and other government
agencies revealed that there is an increasing trend in the demand of the mangoes

both in the local market and in the export market.

The study also find out that for the last 10 years, there is a deficit in the

supply of mangoes even in the local market.

Another important aspects revealed to the researcher is the idea that the
prices of mangoes retailed in the local and export market has been in an upward
trend from 1986 to 1996. These are reflected in the Department of Trade and

Industry Annual report of 1997.

The Channel of marketing the product will be directly to local wholesalers,

retailers and dealers.

Technical Aspects

The book on The Philippines Recommends Mangoes provided the all the

important aspects related to the production of mangoes from the time the seedlings

are planted to the care of the fruits. With the ‘information provided in the book
and with the assistance of the technical persons from the Department of Trade and

Industry, there is no problem as regards to the Technical aspects of the study.

One more positive aspects of the proposed venture is the place. Gingoog
City is through the years very famous in the production of Mango. The climate
and the soil condition points favorably to the production of mangoes whose quality

can pass very well to the international standards.

Management Aspects

The proposed business will be organized as a Sole Proprietor. The
Proponent will personally manage the farm with the assistance of a Foreman for
supervision purposes and of a Consultant for the technical aspects. The
development of the site will be handled by contract workers while the
maintenance of the farm will be taken cared of by a group of permanent farm

workers. Records of the farm will be handled by a bookkeeper/clerk.

Financial Aspects

The capital requirements for the proposed Project is placed at
P391,223.00. The proponent will invest all the needed amount at P450,000.00.
Profit will start at the beginning of the 6"" year, Financial analysis were computed
where the rate of return, and payback period was computed. Results of the

computation showed that the proposed project is financially feasible.
","Chapter |

Marketing Aspects

The marketing aspects aims to enable the farmer to market their produce
and its-products at the price support level or even higher. Carabao variety is
recommended both for local and export markets. This chapter discusses both the
demand and supply profile, the channel of distribution and marketing and

promotion scheme of the proposed venture.

Demand analysis

While consumption of fresh mango fruits is far from variety, there seems
little doubt that processed products are also demand as evidenced by the
appearance of a variety of mango preparations in groceries and supermarkets.
Mango fruits are specially desirable because of their suitability for processing of
practically all stages of development and their thick flesh when mature or ripe.

Ripe fruits are abundant during the months of April and May. Green fruits are

needed to prepare such popular items as “ Burong Mangga .”

In the international market, the demand for mango in Japan alone is placed

at 191,500 tons per year. Previous yearly production indicated that the Philippine

cannot fill the Japanese market.
Supply Analysis
Mango consumption estimated at 16.3 kg./person / year, in a given locality
is apparently far from the point of satiety. With a very high market promotions in

Japan and Hong kong, demand can be easily created for mango.

Rationale

Human hair grows in varying amounts over the body’s
surface. It is most abundant on the head and does not grow
on the palm of the hands or the soles of the feet.

Different people have different kinds of hair. Pluck
out a strand of the hair on your head and examine it to see
if it is coarse, medium or fine.

Hairstyles have undergone many changes over the years.
At various times in history, both men and women have worn
their hair short, long, curly, wavy, braided and powdered.

In ancient Egypt, women colored their hair with
mudpacks. At times, hairstyle told a great deal about a
person’s place in society. Royalty and nobility wore
elaborate coiffures while ordinary people usually wore

simple styles.

This is to anticipate the demand of the different
hairstyles in the present society of Butuan. Hence, this
project proposal.

Marketing Aspect

The new establishment of 21)’s Information Resource Center in Butuan City has
its own policy to impose the users’ fees and other services in fiscal year 2000. The price

is P 50.00 per hour per user,

Pricing is the component through which management attempts to recover all the
costs of its marketing efforts and is the variable that offers the most flexibility. Price is
where the value of a product to the customer and the company’s compensation for

producing it intersect.

Pricing objectives include profit, profit maximization (setting the price to make
the largest possible revenues), market share (obtaining as many potential customers as

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The egg production is one of the profitable business in the country
because the demand of the product is very high and the price is very competitive.
Chicken eggs are one of the cheapest and excellent sources of protein. People
of all ages are all users of eggs because of its nutritional value. Apart from
being easy to prepare, it is one of the mostly high concentrated forms of
nitrogenous food, about one third of its weight being solid nutriment. It is also
confirmed to have a low-calorie source of protein, Vitamin A, riboflavin, Vitamin
B-12, iron, zinc, phosphorus, potassium, and other nutrients.

Access to information technology that provides technical knowledge,
information and expertise in managing poultry production has made it easy to
undertake egg production business. The Department of Agriculture has been
noted for its full support to the livelihood seekers in order to generate income and
employment to the populace.

Based on the financial analysis presented, the proposed business is
profitable even in its first year of operation though the margin is very minimal. In
the succeeding years, the profit indicated and increasing return on investment
from 42 percent to 57 percent while the payback period indicated to be very fast
since the amount of P4,555,000.00 will be realizable within 2 years.

This shows that the proposed project is a good opportunity for profit generation
and is thus feasible considering the minimum requirement of capital to be

invested plus the availability of the technology in engaging egg production.
Vil

The taxes generated from this project will directly benefit the government
and ultimately the community by collecting at an annual average of P423,227.64
for the first five year period of life of the business.

Moreover, when this project is undertaken, it will encourage and promote
livelihood opportunities among entrepreneurs of small scare industries in the
municipality and region wide. As such, it will augment household income of the
members of the community as a result of employment from this project and more

personnel will be hired if the project expands later on. Thus this project is worthy

to be undertaken.

MARKETING FEASIBILITY ASPECT

Backaround

The egg industry is a major component of the Philippine economy. It
provides employment to about 90,000 farmhands, managers, trades, market

vendors and transit / store helpers.
There are about 1,000 egg farmers in the country where 70 percent (700
farmers) are from Luzon, 15 percent (150 farmers) are from Visayas and 7
percent (70 farmers) are from Mindanao. Almost all the farmers in Luzon are
members of different groups namely: 1) Bulacan Egg Producers Association, 2)
Pampanga / Tariac Group, 3) Nueva Ecija Group, 4) Batangas Group, 5) Rizal
Group. 6) Quezon / Bicol Group. 7) Cavite Group. These seven groups are
considered as the key players of the industry which are also under the umbrella
of the National Federation of Egg Producers of the Philippines. Farmers in
Visayas and Mindanao however have not strengthened themselves into an
organization, which the National Federation of Egg Producers of the Philippines
plans to do as soon as possible.
In Caraga region. there are only two key players involved in the industrv.
As shown in the records of the Bureau of Agricultural Statistics, over the last 5
years since 2000, the region's demand in the utilization of chicken egg poultry
products has been steadily increasing in terms of metric tons while the arowth

","INTRODUCTION

Tourism Industry is one of the back bones of economy in developed,
developing and underdeveloped countries and one of the major sources of
foreign exchequer. This industry is growing very rapidly and millions of people
are directly and indirectly associated with this Industry. This industry
represents accounts for 9.9 percent of global GDP, 10.9 percent of world
exports, and 9.4 percent of world investment. (World Economic Forum, 2009).

The Philippine travel and tourism industry continues to benefit from the
expansion of international and domestic routes by low cost carriers and
increased flight frequency to popular destinations. A handful of low cost
carriers went as far as offering new flights from Manila, although many focused
on secondary airports such as Cebu, Iloilo and Clark. The constant availability
of affordable airfares enabled more local residents and foreign tourists to
explore the country’s 7,107 islands, and allowed more travellers to fly in and
out of the Philippines. As a result, inbound and domestic tourism flows saw
double-digit growth during 2012. (www.euromonitor.com/travel-and-tourism-in-
the-philippines,Country Report, Travel and Tourism in the Philippines, Sept,
2013.)

During January 2012, the Department of Tourism launched a global
campaign under the simple yet memorable slogan “It's More Fun in the
Philippines”. Raising awareness of the country as a tourism destination and
establishing favorable perceptions of the Philippines were the main objectives

of the campaign as many foreigners remain unaware of the Philippines. With
limited financial resources, the Department of Tourism relied heavily on social
media, inviting internet users to upload photographs of both popular and less
well-known Philippine holiday destinations and adding words to the now
popular slogan. The campaign has so far been successful as much of the
user-created content went viral within hours, catching the attention of the
international media as well as high numbers potential of potential inbound

arrivals.

With the rise of internet usage on people's daily life, tourism industries
are tapping business through e-commerce. E-commerce refers both financial
and_ informational transaction through electronic media between on
organization, between people or to third party (Chaffey et.al, 2006). Through e-
commerce, these industries are trying to reach global population to enhance
their business through different e-commerce tools and ad there will be more

and more challenge to these sectors in coming days for adopting e-commerce.

Travel service business is a continuing business that shall never perish
since it involves the business of movement. And for as long as people move
from one place to another place there shall be always requirements for travel
like food, lodging and transportation. And the travel agent shall always come
handy as he provides whatever assistance he can give in order to make the
client's movement as safe, convenient and practical as possible. (Carlos

Estacio Ill).
xi

Travel agencies are more about selling advice to clients interested
about taking holidays which are organized by tour operators. The travel
agency is commission based so every time you sell a holiday for an operator
they give you a percentage of the fee. This is where getting your name known

will be important as international tour operators are offering favorable rates

with known partners.

For the business to stay competitive in the industry, it requires people
who love to effectively communicate with customers, confident and high
initiative, assertive and persistent to be able to attract customers to buy the
best deals or offering the business is selling. These customers want to be
assured they will easily be able to hire a car, go walking or get vegetarian
food. Customers need to be provided with personal touch.vel and see

different places.

Given the above competing challenges and opportunities in the tourism
industry, the proponent has seen that starting a travel service business is
indeed a competitive business. This is supported by the proponent’s
expertise and experiences in marketing and selling products and services of
the business he successfully managed. As entrepreneur himself, he became
a frequent traveler and enjoys moving to see different places. Moreover, the
proponent has observed the higher demands of providing customers effective
and efficient travel service business for an enjoyable and productive travel.

Executive Summary

Chicken broiler is ane of the most Progressive animal enterprises in
the Philippines today. The poultry industry in fact began as the backyard

enterprise but has shifted to the formation of very large integrated contract

farming operations.

The growth of poultry industry in the Philippines has been impressive

but its problems include inefficient moncgerrent one the prevalence of

many destructive poultry diseases and parcittes cannot be ignored.

The chicken is the most exploited species of pouliry, which is utilized

for food production. scientific researchers have been done on this species

for past centuries and it is’ still the focus of. the present and future

experimentation. In the Philippines chicken rank first, while ducks rank

second in economic importance as Source of meat and eggs. .

This feasibility study is trying to determing the feasibility and viability of
putting up a poultry production project in Butuon City to preduce fresh and

first class broiler meat for Caraga and tne Nearby regions. The study has

indicated the following findings:
6
1. The Bureau of Agricultural Statistics in Caraga region documented that
there is an increasing trend in the demand of the chicken for the

five years historical records from 199 to. 2003. Correspondingly, the

study showed an increasing trend in the supply but it is less than in

number than the demand, This is exécied as chicken is one of the

staple food among Filipinos, ‘Also, chicken is a'little cheaper than pork

and beef, .
. Based on the actual dato collated by the Bureau of Agricultural
Statistics, Caraga Regional Office, Butuan City, the price of live chicken
continually increased from 70, 69 per kilo | in 1999, 72.19 in 2000, 75.16 in
2001, 78.09 in 2002, to 80. 771 in 2003. On the other hand, the price per
kilo of fully dressed chicken is a fittle bit higher than live or undressed
chicken. Subsequently from .1999 to 2008 it also posted an increasing
price annually, Given these trends where the price of chicken js:
continuously increasing, it ear be gleched that future projection of
sales or revenue of the business would surely be Increasing in trend in
the succeeding. years where profit i is closely realizable.
For the first year operation, this pIsien Is To. undertake.an annual target

market share of 5.1% based on volume Of its production and is

estimated to increase by 10% every succeeding year,

MARKETING FEASIBILITY ASPECTS
Background

Scientifically, broiler meat is a supplementary Product to livestock

meat production. At ‘mas, it becomes complementary or alternative

source of meat if price trends need so. Broiler mono was estimated at
31.53 million birds during January 1, 2004 Which i is equivalent to 17.4 percent
lower than last year’s level of 38. 2 million birds “(Chicken Industry
Performance Report, Livestock and Poultry Statistics Division, Bureau of
Agricultural Statistics, Department. of Agriculture), The bulk of broiler stocks
(live) was soneentrdted in Central Luzon (31%), Southern Tagalog (29.6%),
southern Mindanao (7.3%), Northern Mindanas (0.5%), and Central Visayas
(5.9%). These regions accounted fos about 80 percent of the total broiler
stocks in the country. ,

The ‘total volume of chicken meat imports in 2003 was 13.6 million
metric tons, valued at 7.1 million pesos: - The total volume of imports in
2003 increased by 12.0 percent and 16.5 percent réspectively, compared |
with the previous year's levels. The first semester volume of imports
significantly increased by 82.7 percent, while in the second semester
importation dropped by 20.4 percent compared with the levels during the

same period last year,

As reflected in the records, the poultry sub-sector contributed 13.63%
to the total value of Agriculture production due to the recorded

increase in demand. .National government including local government

of Butuan City is vigorously supporting the livestock industry in the

couniry. The Department or * Agticutue encourages individuals,

partnership and cooperatives involved | in ihe business of holding livestock,
pouliry, eggs, milk and meat to register and to obtain license from the
Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) to establish direct communication

"CASSAVA PLANTATION
","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Proposed Project

The proposed project is a Cassava plantation farm in Esperanza,
Agusan del Sur. This will be established in a 10 hectare agricultural
land. Cassava, locally known as kamoteng kahoy or balinghoy, has
long been a source of food for many Filipinos. While admittedly,
cassava is very common in Caraga Region and it is readily available in
the market, the produce of this project will not be sold, however, In the
market, but all the produce shall be transported to Cebu where there is

marketing linkages between Cassava Food Plant in Cebu and the

proponent.

The said project will be situated in Barangay Hawilian, Agusan
del Sur. This is more or less 60 kilometers away from Butuan City or
about two hours ride from Butuan City. The place is suitable for

cassava plantation and it is also accessible by land transportation.
","Chapter 1

MARKETING ASPECTS

The Product

Growing cassava crop entails simple farm operations such as
land preparation, Planting, replanting, weeding, cultivation, and
harvesting. Small scale require fifty one (51) mandays, to operate a
hectare of land. The plantation type of production needs fifty-five (55)
mandays per hectare to undertake all the necessary farm operation.

A hectare of land can be expected to produce as much as 50
tons of tubers. Yet under the present conditions, a harvest of 35 tons
per hectare is already economically profitable (Phil. Source) Council for

agriculture and resources — research and development, Los Barfios,

Laguna 1983).

Demand Analysis

There is no specific demand for general consumption
considering that we are yet to establish the consumption rate of more
than 65 million Filipinos. However, a lot of industries have already been
established in the Philippines, thus, determining the demand based on
their raw material requirements of these industries which is cassava

tubers can now be given importance.
Though this study, the proponent Is yet to get the data from

existing food manufacturers on their respective cassava requirements,

an in view of the lack of time, the proponent has depended solely on the

monthly requirements of Cebu Cassava Food Plant.

Considering the varied utilization of cassava from cassava flour,
cassava trips, sago (starch/pellets), noodles production, food, feed, and
to alcohol production, the demand of this product is great. It is
projected that each man consume 15 kilograms of cassava from the
different utilization of cassava. The following table will show its

demand.
Supply Analysis

As it can be cleaned from table 2 and table 7 that the total
production of cassava both from the southern and northern Mindanao
and in Butuan City can not meant the demand of cassava. It is also
shown in table 7 that that there is a perennial and continues demand of
this product to the increase of population and the discovery of good

utilization of this product
Supply Demand Analysis
As shown in Table 9, there is a great gap between supply and
demand. There is a great disparity between supply and demand. This
Situation might have attributed much on the over population where in
the demand of this product has been affected. Other factor might be
the discovery of the us ability of cassava not only utilization as food but

other uses which are also equally important.

Chapter 1
INTRODUCTION

Agricultural production for food consumption is one of the priorities in the
agribusiness sector nowadays. Region 10 population is growing rapidly especially
Cagayan de Oro City. It’s growth rate is 2000 percent and already it has a million people
(focus, 1190:6). One of the major factors is due to the opening of the Cagayan de Oro -
lligan Corridor (CIC) special development projects as a major Agro-Industrial Center in

Mindanao with commence in year 1996. Food is required to serve the growing needs of

the region.

With in the last few decades, animal farming has evolve to become one of the
major industry in the country. This development was brought about by many factors of
which the most significant are increased demand of animal protein, improved methods of

disease prevention and control and improved methods of management and nutrition.

However, even under today’s much intensified system of animal farming “the
protein gap” is is still as real as it was. The country’s production of animal protein needs
are still met by importation of animal products from other countries. The demand of
animal protein could rise further as the Filipino population grows, especially

in Region 10
and become more conscious on proper nutrition. Nevertheless, due to the plunging valu
g e
. r ualit
of the peso, the Filipinos may have to turn to cheap but rich sources of high quality

protein. In this particular respect, the poultry industry will probably play a major role in

narrowing the protein gap. Chicken are among the cheapest sources of high quality

protein owing to the fact that they multiply fast and are very efficient converters of the

feedstuffs into meat and eggs.

~—

Mindanao of which Region 10 is a part, is the major producer of corn and other
feedstuffs of which 60% of the Philippine productionist from this region. Thus the region
‘s a favorable site for livestock and poultry production. Annually the per capita
consumption of poultry meat on dressed weight basis is 6.2 kilogram per person (NSO,

1995). There is a great demand for broiler in Region 10.

MARKETING ASPECTS

Swine Production Background

Records obtained from the Bureau of Animal Industry showed that local
hog production used to be inadequate to satisfy the effective and nutritional
demand for animal protein foods of the rapidly increasing population of Butuan
City and the neighboring municipalities in Agusan del Norte and Agusan del Sur.
Estimates in 1977 showed that per capita consumption of pork was 7.1 kg. With a

gap between demand and supply of 9.36% (SQUIBB,1988 ).

The problem of animal protein shortage was partly solved by importing
meat and meat products, this was done on the third quarter of 1990 and the first
quarter of 1991. This was protested by hog raisers in the Philippines which lead to
its stoppage in April, 1991 in order to protect the local hog industry and prevent
serious drain on the dollar reserves of the country, (Business Star 1991). In order
to provide the urgently needed supply, it was thought that the development of the
swine industry should be pursued with greater vigor and determination. The growth

rate of the industry was as follows:

Source: National Statistics Office, 1996

Effectively, the industry in the Philippines since 1985 which produced 623,

480 Metric Ton was increasing only at the rate of 5.44% per annum.

In Region XIII, there was a slow down inspite of its proximity to feed
supplies. The main setback of production was the high initial capital and the
insufficient technical knowledge of most producers. There were 19 commercial
producers in Caraga Administrative Region comprising Butuan City, Surigao City,
Agusan del Norte and Sur and Surigao del Norte and Sur. with a population of

3,697 heads as of January 1, 1991. The production inventory range is 801,194

heads ( Bureau of Animal Industry, 1996 ).
Philippine production of hogs as of the first quarter of 1996 had a growth
rate of 5.16%, monitored at 265,000 MT production. This was way below the

Bureau of Agriculture Statistics projected growth rate placed at 8.6%.

Demand Analysis

Historical demand for pork has increased by 2.69% on the average for the
entire region of Caraga. Demand was directly proportional with the growth of the
population. This is shown in Table 1. Per capita consumption was pegged at 7.1
kilos. Actual consumption for 1990 was greater than this figure, however

conservative figure was taken to ensure conservative estimates.

Past demand on the average was 598.6 MT per annum. Projected demand

increment was placed at 2.33%. This was equivalent to 655 MT of pork per year.

Supply Analysis

The trends in 1988 - 1996 behaved erratically. This registered a negative
growth of 1. 42 %. The National Meat Inspection Commission (MIC, ) of Region
XIIl countered that there was a high degree of a slaughter period in negative

growth years without replacing the herd due to high demand and coupled with high

cost of production.

MARKETING ASPECTS

Background

Official figures from the Annual Reports of the Department of trade and
Industry (1999), Region XII revealed that there has always been a less supply of
poultry products in the existing market of Region XII for the last 10 years. As of
May 1991, only 94 commercial producers were involved in broiler production with
a total Inventory of 22,349 heads with a range of 100-3,000 heads Inventory level
and 100 poullry men are involved in commercial egg laying business with a total
inventory of 962,673 layers. Only few people are engaged in broiler production
due to lack of capilal, insufficient knowledge on the technical and marketing
intricacies of broilers. Due to this, the supply of poultry meat in the market comes

from backyard poultry raising of which, the native type of chickens are raised.

For its part, domestic livestock production reeled from imbalance brought
about by a high slaughter rate and decreasing head inventory. It manged a
measly 3.26% growth rate at the first quarter of 1995 compared with the previous
year (Business Star Indicator, May 1995:2) Growth target for livestock production

is pegged at 6% for 1995 (CRC, 1994).
Broller meat Is a supplemetary product to livestock meat production. At
limes, it becomes complementary or alternative source if price trends need so.

Livestock production contributed 11.17% to the total agricultural production

Value in 1995,

By type of herd, carabao production was rather slow during the first
quarter of 1995, a 7.41% decrement from 1994. Goat and Dairy though not
worse off were neither better off since production did not grow at all. In fact,

this has been the case since 1993 when goat production levelled off at 14,000

MTS and dalry at 3,000 MTS.

On the other hand, Hog and Cattle production fared quite well with the
growth rate of 5.16% and 2.44% respectively. Hog productlon was monitored

at 265,000 MTS. While cattle at 42,000 MTS (Business Star, May 1995 ).

The poultry subsector contributed 10.23% to the total value of
Agriculture production due fo increase in demand. The government is
vigorously supporting the livestock industry inthe country. The Department of

Supply-Demand Analysis

The historical trend of the broiler supply since 1990 in the Province of
Sultan Kudarat and the entire Region XII has only grown by 2.6% in the average.
There is an increasing —decreasing behavior of supply for Region All while
Davao Province registered a mean growth of 1.83%. This are shown in Tables
1,2, and 3.

Moreover, there was a decrease of 1.15% in 1986 in response to higher
cost of production due {to Increase in oil cost which was translated to high
inflation rate (16.7%). An up trend by 1.12% in 1987 and 5,5% in 1988 was
experienced due mainly to a stabilized rate of inflation (10.2% and 10.0%
respectively). However, the reverse trend occurred in 1989 and 1999 (decrease

in supply by 7.66% and 8.53% respectively for Tacurong City 14.67% and 4.46

for Gen. Santos City).

A. The Project

The project is the proposed establishment of a 400 trees durian plantation with
banana inter-cropping strategy in a s-hectares or 50,000 sq.m. lot owned by the Bacomo
family in Rufaran, San Vicente , Digos, Davao Del Sur.

The project is to be personally manage by the proponent with the help of the
members of the family who are directly members of the partnership and who have gained

adequate and sufficient knowledge in Durian planting. It is intended to strengthen the

existing banana plantation of the family.
","MARKETING ASPECTS

Target Market

The target market of the products of the proposed project will be the general
public of Davao del Sur, Norte and Davao City thru the countless fruit vendors or
contract buyers of either in the local or export market. The current marketing channels of

fresh durian fruits in the Philippines today follow two routes.

a. The first involves the midlemen who contract the fruits in the orchard a month
or earlier before maturity. The contract buyers normally pays the owner 50%
and the balance upon the harvest of the fruits. Then the contract buyers, after

consumation of the price , will take care of the orchard to prevent pilferage

b. The second route involves the owner harvesting the fruits and selling the same

either by wholesale or retail directly in the market places.
Description of the Market

The target market of the proposed venture will be the general public thru fruit

b. The second route involves the owner harvesting the fruits and selling the same

either by wholesale of retail in the market places.
Presently, the farm gate price of durian fresh fruits for wholesale in the local
market range from P50.00 to P100.00 depending on the size. Moreover, other durian pulp
packed in special polystyrene containers has a current price of P90.00 to P170.00 per kilo

in the export market. In the world market, there are only 3 sources of the product, namely;

2. Bureau of Plant Industry (BPI) - Bago, Oshiro, Davao City

Note: The Philippines production is only an estimated figure which is computed based on

the present 8,000 ha. of durian plantation throughout the country.

This suggests that the supply of durian were very slim while the demand of the
product is so great. In Thailand, for example only 7% were exported and 93% were
consumed locally, while Malaysia, only 16% were exported and about 84% were
consumed in their own country. On the other hand, the production volume in the
Philippines is only 7% with that of Thailand and 16% production volume with that of

Malaysia.

Rationale

The establishment of this proposed project has a
number of objectives. However, its main objective is to
provide the public with the excellent food services, which
they can seldom find in Butuan City. This is because in
Butuan, only few restaurants offers satisfaction to their
clients. Some other restaurants offers limited choices of food
or menus. However, other establishments that offer food
services usually caters common menus. Most of which are only
good for snacks. Yet, we have many bakeries that offer bread,
cookies, cakes, and etc. and carenderias that offer a vary
limited choice of food. The proposed project aims to give the
customers’ demand of having a better alternative where they

can have a wider choice of menu, and give the customers

satisfaction to their food preferences.

iti
The restaurant will also accept catering services for

such special occasions with preferable style and food

preference by the customers.

Furthermore there is no need for the residents of Butuan

City to go to other places or location just to find a

preferable place for a choice of celebration for some

important occasions such as birthdays, anniversaries, weddings

and others.

TORICAL DEMAND FOR DRYING

Demand for drying of rice and corn grains usually occurs
during harvest time particularly in the months of April to June and
September to November. Based on the data gathered from the
Department of Agriculture, Provincia] Office, Agusan del Sur,
historical demand averages from 1994 to 1998 is 32,132.20 tons for
rice and 13,465 tons for corn or a total of 45,957.20 tons Please see
table I for Demand for Rice and Corn Drying by Municipality, in

Metric Tons, in Pesos (1994-1998).

Moreover, the province of Agusan del Sur has a total area of
896,000 hectares of lands. Based on the data gathered from the
Department of Agriculture, Agusan del Sur, area planted to corn and
palay for 1998 totalled to 54,989 hectares, 23,182 hectares planted to
corn and 31,807 hectares to rice, roughly 6% of the entire area of

Agusan del Sur. Since Agricultural area suitable to rice and corn in

the province is about 258,000 hectares, only 54,989 hectares of the

total area has been developed leaving 203,011 hectares undeveloped.

ed
agricultural lands are cultivated every year, only 2,039 hein:
‘ es are

Assuming that only 1% of the remaining undevelop

planted to rice and corn every year estimated to Produce 2,436 tons
for corn for one year and 9,744 tons for rice per annum. Assume
further that the 4 municipalities in the ARC Resettlement Area
constitute 18% of the total area planted to corn and 24% of the total
area planted to rice, share of the 4 Municipalities for demand in

drying is 876 tons for corn and 2,339 tons for palay.

PROJECTED DEMAND

Using the Arithmetic Mean Method of Projection, the
projected demand of the 4 municipalities in Metric Tons, and in
Pesos in year 2000-2004 is arrived at by increasing the projected
demand for rice and corn drying at10% per annum. Please see Table

II — Projected Demand for Rice and Corn Drying, by Municipality, in

Metric Tons, in Pesos (2000-2004).
SUPPLY AND PRODUCTION

Supply of Rice and Corn for Drying in 4 Municipalities js
taken from the Department of Agriculture, Agusan del Sur

Production of the 4 Municipalities is reflected in Table III.
PROJECTED SUPPLY

At present, the supply of rice and corn to be dried in the 4
Municipalities is about 36,138 Metric Tons. On the average, the
project assumes a conservative increase of supply of rice and corn to
be dried atl0% per annum. Please refer attached Table IV —

Projected Supply of Rice and Corn to be Dried by Municipality, in

Metric Tons, In Pesos (2000-2004).
DEMAND AND SUPPLY ANALYSIS:

The demand gap is determined by comparing the demand and
supply in 4 municipalities for the past 5 years from 1994 to1998.
Based on the comparison, we have a total demand of 227,986 Metric
Tons of rice and corn to be dried and the supply is only 180,689
Metric Tons of rice and corn. Thus, we have a gap or difference of
47,297 Metric Tons or an average of 9,459 Tons to be dried every

year from 1994 to1998.

The need therefore for the Mechanical Dryers in Agusan
Resettlement ARC is indeed urgent, considering that 9,459 Metric
Tons of rice and corn are in dire service for drying. Please see Table

V - Comparison of Demand and Supply in Agusan del Sur and

payback period of the project is 1 year and 8 months, and has a 16.4% average
return on investment. Through this project, the association will be able to reach
out to the community by providing job to those who are jobless, by extending
their effort through donations, project and creating new projects.
","As the number of health-conscious is increasing nowadays, it is best to
produce a healthy food product. According to FMCG Gurus, 59% have become
more conscious about their overall health and 57% about their immunity. As a
result, 73% say that they prefer to eat and drink healthier. Therefore, a health-
conscious person is concerned about what they should eat and what not to eat
to prevent chronic disease. Thus, the researchers research what to produce

healthy and the raw materials available in their area.

The product to be produced is healthy snack chips, not fry, and no
artificial additives. According to goodnessme.com.au, it is a high source of
dietary fiber, which keeps you more full for longer and makes a difference in
stabilizing your blood sugar — so you do not get a vitality plunge 20 minutes
after eating. Fiber moreover bolsters intestine well-being by making a difference
to keep you regular. It is also a great source of valuable medium-chain-fatty-
acids (MCFAs), a suitable type of saturated fat that tends to be spent as vitality
instead of putting away as fat. And keep in mind that fat fills you up, postponing
stomach purging and leaving a well-rounded coating within the mouth, so you're

feeling fulfilled for hours a short time later.

partnership with the Barangay Council of Ong Yiu that entails the household
of the barangay to practice proper segregation of waste materials. Butuan City
has 86 barangays, and one of the problems facing each barangay’s is the
garbage disposals. And out of 86 barangay’s, we choose barangay Ong Yiu to
give this livelihood project.

Since their preliminary problem, this day is their massive waste disposals, as
a result, they are now using their covered court as their garbage dumpsite.
This business aims to have a zero-waste that will be beneficial to the
community and the environment. However, when we learn how to segregate
the waste that we generate accurately, we can minimize our carbon footprint
and positively impact our environment.

The business will be strategically located at R. Calo streets, Butuan city. It is
located along the highway, which is highly accessible to the household of
barangay Ong yiu and convenient in transporting the product to the respective
tied-up junk-shops. Will reach the business through their physical store,
Tarpaulins and social media. The business shall be open from 8:00 a.m. to
5:00 p.m. from Monday to Saturday.

The initial investment of the proposed business will be a total of three hundred
thousand pesos (300,000), which is generated from the investors. The
business net profit margin would be 35% respectively in the year 1- 5, and the
following month of the operations indicated that the business would recover its
investment cost after five months.

Since the business has a growing market and the potential to gain profit
quickly, the proponents believe that the project is feasible.

consumption.

The prime beneficiary of this project is the members of the Anticala
Farmers Association, which has a total of one hundred (100) farmers who
cultivated Coconut, Abaca, and banana with approximately ninety-eight (98)
hectares of farmland. The proposed project targets an increase of twenty
percent (20%) of new members annually. The projected demand will reach
58,176.00 on Coconut Dehusking Machine and 69,930.00 on Abaca Spindle
Stripping Machine based on the computed result of the survey conducted.

The warehouse of this project will be at Purok 1Barangay Anticala,
Butuan City, which will open every Monday to Friday from 8 am to 5 pm. The
member-borrower can still use the machines during weekends as long as they
booked it during operating hours.

The project will be operated by the Anticala Farmers Association
(ANFA) registered under the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE)
last March 17, 2018, headed by Mr. Eulalio Dalogdog, President. The
member-borrower had to follow organizational policies to grant his request to
borrow.

For the initial operation of the project, it needs 1,420,000.00 pesos
to acquire the tools and equipment required. The government will fund the
capital generation through the grants of a government program and the initial
capital of the association. The assets of this project will reach up to two (2)
Million after five (5) years. The profit will gradually every year considering the
financial assumptions forecasted. It will also take six (6) years and one (1)
month to return the investment.

Project Description

The types of machinery that will provide for the proponents are the
spindle stripping machine and the dried coconut dehusking machine. The
Mobile spindle stripping machine will help the abaca farmers in extracting fiber
faster than using manual. The coconut dehusking machine will allow farmers to
dehusk the Coconut faster, reduce human effort, time consumption, and

provide safety for the operator.

The Anticala Farmers Association (ANFA) is composed of 100 members,

who are a resident of barangay Anticala. Its operation started in October 2016.

Their primary crops are Coconut, Abaca, and banana, in approximately

98 hectares, owned by the association.

In coconut and abaca harvesting, they usually utilize manual labor, which
the farmers encountered a problem since it consumes longer time and expense.
The farmers would likely commend having a dehusking machine and stripping

machine to make their work easier and faster.

population as stated in PhilAtlas, 2015. The community has some existing livelihood
programs, and one of these is they offer eco-friendly bricks during the year 2018.
The livelihood program realized that this would have a significant impact on the
solution to their garbage issue that quickly flooded in some walkways within the
barangay, which also helps attain their primary purpose, which is to achieve a zero-
waste. As the result of the objective of the barangay, they came up with a unique
variation of the products made up of shredded plastic bottles and grind glass bottles.
The development was well-planned and underwent some procedural tests to achieve
the best quality result; however, the effectiveness of developing the eco-friendly
bricks has stopped. Up to these days, the livelihood program is lack progress. For
this matter, the researchers reached out to the Barangay Captain and then
introduced this to them. The Researchers named Eco-builders, and this time they
included the hollow-blocks to be part of the product they offered, and this was the
reason behind the name of this livelihood program as “Eco-Builders: Bricks &

Hollow-blocks”.

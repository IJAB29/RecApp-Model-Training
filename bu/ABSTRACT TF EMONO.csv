CASE ABSTRACT
The researchers conducted a study entitled Customer Satisfaction of
Lifestar Family Karaoke. The study aims to evaluate the customer satisfaction
of Lifestar Family Karaoke for its Customer Service and Physical Environment
of the lobby, KTV rooms and receiving area in terms of spatial layout,

functionality, and ambient conditions.

To evaluate the customer satisfaction of Lifestar Family Karaoke, a
descriptive research method and purposive-convenience sampling technique
was used in gathering the data. A modified questionnaire was also developed
and used a frequency distribution table using weighted mean. The study was
conducted from April 2017 to May 2017. The result of the evaluation showed
that the Physical Environment of Receiving Area of Lifestar got the highest
weighted mean satisfied; which meets customersâ€™ expectation while the three
areas got less satisfied, which is below customersâ€™ expectation, specifically for
the Physical environment of the Lobby, Physical Environment of KTV Rooms,
and Customer Service. For the Physical Environment of the Lobby, they
should add LED lights around the dining area, for the Physical Environment of
the KTV Rooms, they should strictly implement the standard procedure in
spraying the air freshener and the employees should wait for 2 â€” 5 minutes
before letting the customer in, so that the scent of the air freshener would not
be as strong and irritating. For the customer service, they should strictly
implement their standard in greeting customers and put up sanctions for those

employees that fail to follow standard procedures and the employees should

CASE ABSTRACT

Evaluation on Inventory Management of Angging Dry Goods Store in
Buenavista, Agusan del Norte was assessed. There were areas subjected to
the study (forecasting, ordering and controlling) to help the management
change their traditional way of inventory management. The study used the
descriptive method of research and a purposive-complete enumeration
sampling method. About 8 respondents were analyzed that includes the store
manager, cashier, six sales ladies. Results showed that in evaluating the
inventory management of the store, forecasting, ordering and controlling has
a weighted mean of 2.40, 2.80, and 1.43, respectively. In terms of forecasting,
the management lacks knowledge in forecasting that causes them to have
incorrect forecasting of the demand. In ordering, the management does not
have a reorder point for their inventory which causes them to order stocks
always from their suppliers. In controlling, the management lacks control over
its inventory and failed to follow any standard practices. It was concluded that
the areas mentioned above contributed to the increasing number of slow-
moving stocks made for bargain below its original cost which results in the
decrease of the company's net income of the said store. The management
should adopt the FIFO method and POS to have control of the inventory and
avoid obsolescence stocks and conduct training and seminars to educate the
employees of the store.

CASE ABSTRACT

The study evaluated the customer satisfaction of Wings Bakeshop in J.
Satorre Street, Langihan, Butuan City, specifically in Sanitation of the
Bakeshop. The study used descriptive research method to evaluate the
customer satisfaction in terms of sanitation of Wing's Bakeshop.

A total of fifty respondents were surveyed through the use of
questionnaire and interviews. The study employed convenience sampling
method where the respondents of the study were the customers who are there
during the distribution of the survey questionnaire.

The findings revealed that the standard practices of the sanitation that
being set by the bakeshop were observed in few or rare cases. Among the
standard, the implementation of monitoring and handling of the employees were
sometimes based on the standard since the bakeshop has their own practices
in implementing good sanitation. Hence, the level of satisfaction of Wings
Bakeshop is less satisfied.

The finding showed that in order to solve the sanitation problem of the
Wings Bakeshop, the researchers proposed to strictly implement the sanitation. |
This will help the management to improve their sales and to avoid complaints

from the customer.

CASE ABSTRACT

The researchers conducted a study entitled Service Quality of
J&Jenrich General Services. The study aims to evaluate Service Quality of

J&Jenrich General Services for its Assurance, Reliability, Responsiveness

and Tangible.

To evaluate the Service quality of J&Jenrich General Services, a
purposive-complete enumeration technique was used in gathering the data. A
modified questionnaire was also developed and used a frequency distribution
table using weighted mean. The study was conducted from June 2017 to

October 2017.

The result of the evaluation showed that the four dimensions got the
average weighted mean of less satisfactory, which is below customer's
expectation. specifically, for the Assurance, the management should have
proper training before deployment of the workers. For the Tangible, the
management must strictly impose the wearing of official uniform (color coding)
within the client premises and also include the wearing of personal
identification cards (IDâ€™s) at all time; For the Reliability, the management
should assign a foreman to recheck the performance of the workers and to
ensure cleanliness upon leaving their area after the job and for the

Responsiveness, the management should have a printed check list of the

schedule.

CASE ABSTRACT
The researchers conducted a study entitled Customer Satisfaction of
Narra Restaurant on its store environment such as directional signage, layout,
dÃ©cor, lighting, and functionality. To evaluate the customer satisfaction of
Narra restaurant, a descriptive method of research and purposive-
convenience sampling technique were used in gathering the data. A modified
questionnaire was also developed in conducting the survey and the study was
conducted from June 2017 to October 2017.

Furthermore, analyzing the results of the survey, the researchers used
a frequency distribution table using the weighted derived from the
respondents. In addition, the result of the evaluation showed that customers
of the Narra Restaurant are less satisfied to the store environment of the
restaurant in terms of its directional signage, layout, dÃ©cor, lighting and
functionality.

CASE ABSTRACT

The purpose of this paper is to assess the process of physical
inventory management of Robinson's Supermarket Butuan, specifically on its
policies and procedures of warehouse and selling area, receiving area and

Department Head monitoring that has a direct hold on the recording and

counting of inventories using the JDA system.

The scope of the Study focus only on the Food Department with the

(4) four specific areas namely; the warehouse area, selling area, receiving

and Department Head monitoring. With the used of the researcher-structured
questionnaire, the researcher were able to gather primary data from the said
department. Also the books from internet were used to support the study on

the physical inventory management as the secondary data being gathered.

The study started from the month of July to October 2015. Using
descriptive research method, the physical inventory held in Robinsons

Supermarket Butuan-Branch was evaluated.

The findings of the study revealed that the policies and procedures in
the Selling and Receiving areas and in the monitoring of the Department
Head are applied at all times; while policies and procedures in the warehouse
area are applied in most or majority cases or instances. To mention, in the
warehouse area where it got the lowest average weighted mean, it states that
the counter-staff in the warehouse area experienced some difficulties in

counting the products randomly due to improper preparation during physical

inventory.

Thereâ€™s a need to be improved inside the warehouse area. First is
that the merchandisers must provide withdrawal slip that was check by the
trusted employees (releasing officer in-charge) with the signature for
documentation and monitoring especially on the pull-out documents that will
be given in the counter-staff. Second is that definite plans should be prepared
and developed concerning the date of the physical inventory and each person
connected with the inventory-taking thoroughly acquainted with them should
have prepared written and oral instructions. And last is that before the actual
inventory held, categorizing and organizing of the pull-out products and pre-
counting must be done properly to avoid miscounting and randomly record the

pull-out products from the warehouse to selling area.
products that promotes healthy living. (Robinson's supermarket 2002)

CASE OVERVIEW

The present condition of the physical inventory describes that there is
a difference between the manual and computerized inventory. The physical
inventory does not coincide with the JDA system that they used. The policies
and procedure of the supermarket were from delivery of the products; the

receiving clerk will randomly count and quality check of the products to avoid

miss look and uncounted items to be received and carefully entering the
quantity to the system. After the process, the products will store in the
warehouse, chilled storage, and freezer storage for frozen products. Under
the food department the products stored in the warehouse. The process of the
items pulling out from the warehouse to selling area by the merchandisers
was so accessible. All merchandiser has authority to pull-out the products and

sometimes the pulled-out products are not recorded.

In addition, they have no CCTV's inside the warehouse. During the
preparation of inventory, the selling area and warehouse must set and ready
according to each team. One day before the inventory schedule pre-counting
of products must be done and during the inventory, each participant was
assigned to the team leader, scanner, and counter. After scanning the
barcode of each product using (PDT) or Portable Data Terminal as the
scanner, the information gather will upload to the system after inventory. If
there are overages and shortage occur recounting to the specific products,
must be done (3) three days after the final result of the inventory must submit

to the Head Office to update the system of the store.

The data given to researchers shows that there is a difference
between the actual counting and JDA record of the JDA system. Where the
data shows the different parts of JDA system that comprise among description
of different food products actual counting, JDA record and the difference on it.
The description refers to the name with the weight of the products while the
actual count is the remaining products in the store during inventory. (RTV)

that the supplier or the buyer ordered to pull-out for different purposes such as
bundling promotion, fresh stock assurance and near expiry products while

JDA record is the master list of all products received by the store.

The data shows the difference between the actual count to the count
by the JDA system or the computerize record (see Appendix B for reference).
The difference in the left side of the data given shows the negative result and
the positive result. The negative result means that there is a shortage, or
there are missing items (e.g. wastages, theft, pilferage, spoilage, vendor
fraud, administrative error and damage in transit or a store and cashier
errors). And the positive result means that there is an overage on which the
actual count is higher than the computerized count. The reason of the

"Case Overview

The business is currently engaged in the food industry. It offers a
variety of Filipino dishes. According to the management, the employees are
trained on how to conduct their inventory properly. This includes ordering of
goods from the suppliers, receiving, stocking, and recording. The order of
goods was done by the supervisor who is reviewed and approved by the
branch manager. Receiving of stocks is conducted by the stock clerk in which
they performed this by checking the list of ordered goods and present the
verified list to the supervisor for the approval, after that, the stock clerk will
place the said goods to the stockroom for the stocking. According to the stock

clerk, the arranging of goods is done according to the date received.

Based on the gathered information, recording happens when the store
operation starts, which is executed by the following employees; the fry man,
pantry, barman/barmaid, cook, and a stock clerk who are assign during the
shift. Recording process includes, counting the beginning inventory,
comparing of the ending and the beginning inventory, tagging refers to the
listing of the date that covers the usage of the product from the moment the
product was being transferred from its first designation to its final designation,

labelling refers to listing of the name and the date in which the product was
~@ ACLC COLLEGE of Butuan City, Inc. www. amaes.edu.ph
HDS Bullding 999 J.C. Aquino Avenue, Butuan City 4

~ transferred to its final designation until the product is ready for use,

monitoring it is to check the availability of the product.

According to the conducted preliminary interview, before the operation
started, the employees are preparing for their back-ups, this includes; goods,
ingredients, kitchenware and much more for them to be well prepared for the
whole day operation. Fry man is assigned for the fried dishes they are
required to produce the expected standard for the Chicken, Crispy Pata, and
other fried items. The cook is appointed for cooking all the rubyâ€™s favorite this
includes; Nilagang Baka, Kare-Kare, Hipon Sigang, Sigang na Salmon and
many other. The pantry, they are assigned for the garnishing of the dishes.
The barman/barmaid they are assigned for the preparation of the drinks, salad
and dessert. They also stated that there are times when the restaurant is

running out of ingredients, they will just go to the Robinsons Supermarket to

buy a replacement.

According to the gathered information,most of the time during the
recording process, the employees forgot to list down the spoilages and
wastages and to check the shelf life of the said goods because of busy
cleaning on their station before leaving. They do not correctly count theending
inventory because they usually do estimation, and the employees feel weary
in counting the ending inventory. Employees also mentioned that there is over
portioning and over production because the serve items are not consistent
with its proper presentation. These refer to the sizes and weight of the cooked

and prepared product it is because of the hassle call of orders during peak

researchers used descriptive research method to assess the attractiveness of
the promotional strategies of St. Jude Publishing Graphic Design and Printing

"In business, marketing strategies are necessary to achieve success or

even to maintain it. It needs to suit with the nature of the company and their

customers. It could be the edge of a firm to stay in the competition.

The researchers conducted a study entitled Marketing Strategies of
MAC Lending. The study aims to evaluate the existing marketing strategies of
MAC Lending focusing on the Marketing Mix, which are the product, price, place
and promotion of the company. The researchers gathered information through
an initial interview with the management and conducted a survey of their
customers. Moreover, the study used descriptive research method and

purposive convenience sampling technique in collecting the data.

The result of the evaluation showed that the MAC Lending's Customer
service got the highest weighted mean which can understand that it met the
customer expectations in delivering the service while the Marketing Strategies

of the four areas are being disagreed by the customers because it does not

meet the customers' expectation.

The study revealed that the marketing strategies of the company are less
acceptable for it does not meet the expectations of their customers, So there is

a need to improve especially in its product, price, place and promotion

strategies.

Mac Lending should focus on improving their marketing strategies in the

four areas in terms of Product. The company should offer their product to the
government employees and adjust their payment cycle to make it suitable for

them. In terms of place, the company should add more CCTV and one security

guard to make the customer feel safer. The customers also added that they

need to put a bigger signage outside the building so, it will easy to locate for the
new customers. In terms of Price, the company should decrease their interest
to help their customers. They should also consider their clients if they cannot
pay on time. In terms of Promotion, the business should return the giving of
money as referral incentives because it can help them. The Mac Lending should

mean of 2.47, which were disagreed by the respondents, the result means

that the above factors were below the customersâ€™ expectation.

"CASE ABSTRACT

Customer Satisfaction is the quality of product and the service provided
by every organization. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the customer
satisfaction of Brown Bag Bakeshoppe.The researchers used a primary source
of data through an in-depth interview and data collected through survey
questionnaire for dine-in respondents. A total of fifty (50) were surveyed through
the use of questionnaires and interviews. The study employed convenient
sampling where the respondents of the study are customers who purchased
bread in the store.

Descriptive method was used to describe the Customer Satisfaction of
Brown Bakeshoppe. Likert Scale was used to express the response. The
overall rating of customer satisfaction of Brown Bag Bakeshoppe is 2.19 which
has the verbal description of Less Satisfied which is below the customer's
satisfaction. The findings revealed that the design factors had the lowest
response in terms of customer satisfaction, where the building painting is
already old and faded. For the store environment in terms of the ambient factor,
they should add more wall fans to lessen the temperature of the area, change
the busted lights and add more trash bins inside the store. For the design factor,
the bakeshop should repaint their whole store. In terms of social factor, the

"CASE ABSTRACT

The researchers conducted a study entitled Service Quality of
J&Jenrich General Services. The study aims to evaluate Service Quality of
J&Jenrich General Services for its Assurance, Reliability, Responsiveness
and Tangible.

To evaluate the Service quality of J&Jenrich General Services, a
purposive-complete enumeration technique was used in gathering the data. A
modified questionnaire was also developed and used a frequency distribution

table using weighted mean. The study was conducted from June 2017 to

October 2017.

The result of the evaluation showed that the four dimensions got the
average weighted mean of less satisfactory, which is below customer's
expectation. specifically, for the Assurance, the management should have
proper training before deployment of the workers. For the Tangible, the
management must strictly impose the wearing of official uniform (color coding)
within the client premises and also include the wearing of personal
identification cards (IDâ€™s) at all time; For the Reliability, the management
should assign a foreman to recheck the performance of the workers and to
ensure cleanliness upon leaving their area after the job and for the

"CASE ABSTRACT

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cash management of GDC
eBOX Travel Agency. The scope of this study is within the vicinity of GDC
eBOX Travel Agency. There were only (2) respondents; the owner and
manager who were the knowledgeable persons of the operation of the
agency. This study includes areas in cash management namely; budgeting,
cash handling, replenishment and credit granting/monitoring. The method
used in the study is descriptive research where data were gathered through
Oral interview and survey questionnaire. It indicates that the result of the over-
all rating is disagree, which means that the agency implemented and followed
the cash management practices occasionally, thereby resulting to fairly
managed cash.

From the foregoing findings, it was found out that the areas in
budgeting and cash handling got the lowest weighted mean with a verbal
description of disagree. It is recommended that in its budgeting, the agency
should handle its revenue or cash at bank properly by making it useful for the
agencyâ€™s growth and_ sustainability. While in its cash handling, it is
recommended that when the load reaches its minimum level, reorder should
be readily applied to avoid further delays whenever the middleman has

"The study focuses on the analysis of the Motivational Factors among
Employee in Jollibee Drive Thru and identifies the factors affecting and
assess the level of motivation of employee working and their further
verification by factor analysis. The objective is to identify the
motivationalfactors and hygiene factors using Herzberg theory of
motivationand their impact to employee. The identification of motivation
principles is based on a content analysis of professional and scientific
publications aimed at motivation. The results and conclusions of this study
were consequently verified by a quantitative survey, the data of which were
statistically processed. As a suitable statistical analysis to assess the data
from the survey, a factor analysis was chosen. The results of both analyses
proved and verified identical principles of employee management that affect
motivational factors and hygiene factors.

The research findings help to gain a better understanding and insight
into what drives employeesâ€™ motivation in the Jollibee Drive Thru. It enables
management to adopt a more focused approach towards motivating

"This study aims to evaluate the implementation of collection
management practices of Datalan Communication Services to come up with a
possible solution, to minimize if not totally resolve the current problem which
is the slow turnover in collecting accounts receivable and incurring of large

overdue accounts.

The focus of the study includes six (6) areas, the credit reminders,
methods of payment, rewards for punctual or on-time payment, grace period,

penalties for late payments, and process of litigation.

The study engaged the purposive convenience sampling in choosing
only those customers who were available during the routing of the survey

questionnaires for the data gathering were considered as respondents.

The over-all rating of the collection management practices evaluation is
1.97 which resulted to verbal rating of Sometimes. The implementation of
collection management practices of Datalan Communication Services was
lenient of which practices are observed but applied in few instances which
affect the slow turnover of account receivables and incurs the large

percentage of overdue accounts.

Datalan Communication Services should add more efforts in reminding
the due accounts of the debtor and grant rewards to debtors who will pay a
week or so before due date. Datalan should strictly observe in giving

extensions of payments and pursue the litigation when debts reached one (1)
-.

year after all the payment extensions made. These recommendations were

possibly resolve the current problem of the company.

"This study aims to evaluate the inventory process of ANG
YEE Enterprise which is a small-scale hardware located in
Barangay San Vicente, Butuan City. The proponents of this case
study have determined the inventory flow from the preparation of
purchase order to a payment of said items. However, the research
is specifically geared towards identifying areas of concern which is
the storing, arranging and labeling process of the aforementioned
hardware and eventually provides proposals and recommendations
that will be feasible and reasonable to the current predicament of

the company.

The researchers used descriptive research method since it
involves the gathering of data that describes events and situations
which then organized into useful and relevant information. The
respondents, which represent the total population, comprising of the
owner and his employees were subjected to interviews and survey.
The researchers also conducted actual field observation during the

duration of this study.

Results of the survey showed that its inventory process was
occasionally practiced with an overall mean of 2.44 which is
verbally described as SOMETIMES. Under the category of

STORING, the overall mean is 3.21 which means OFTEN
practiced, 2.70 or OFTEN practiced under ARRANGEMENT and
1.42 or NEVER practiced under LABELING. Based on the results, it
can be concluded that the enterprise lacks the proper methods and
practices in the process of storing, arranging and labeling its
inventory. This is due to the fact that the business does not
regularly check its inventory for any sign of defect and deterioration.
With regard to the arrangement, items are not grouped according to
function typically found in a hardware store. On labeling, the

business does not have any form or system of labeling.

Several adjustments and changes could improve the current
inventory process of the enterprise. About the STORING, inventory
should be checked weekly for any sign of damage and
deterioration. Items should be arranged, organized and grouped
according to the most basic grouping of items in a hardware store in
order to avoid items getting mixed-up up with other items. Products
and all forms of storage materials should be labeled accordingly
with the appropriate names and pictures. By having a systematic

"The study evaluated the implementation of cash management of Peak
Foods Processing in Dona Rosario, Tubay, Agusan Del Norte specifically on
the cash budget, cash disbursement, cash collections and cash monitoring.
The study used a descriptive research method to investigate the cash
management of Peak Foods Practices.

The study employed purposive-complete enumeration sampling where
the respondents of the study are the general manager, finance in-charge, and
bookkeeper involved in the cash management of Peak Foods Processing.
The respondents were surveyed through questionnaires and interviews.

The findings revealed that the practices of cash management that is
being implemented by the company were lenient.

The findings implied that in order to solve the cash management
problem of Peak Foods Processing, the researchers proposed that itâ€™s better
that the finance in-charge should provide an expansion or more than the
minimum amount of cash required to allow for some margin of error in
planning. Every transaction should be approved by the general manager with
supporting documents. The company should strictly implement their collection
Process and minimize the collection period and follow the 15 days grace

Period of every transaction. The bookkeeper should prepare and submit a
daily cash report to the general manager. And record all the collected cash

"CASE ABSTRACT

The study evaluated the implementation of Mindanao Consolidated
Cooperative Bank (MCCB), specifically on the collection management under
commercial loans. The study used a descrintive research method to assess
the implementation of collection management.

The focus of the study includes three (3) areas, the credit reminder,
monitoring and foiiow-ups, and process of litigation

A total of forty-one (41) respondents which composed of thirty (30)
customers who availed commercial loans and eleven (11) employees were
Surveyed through the use of questionnaires and interviews. The study
employed purposive-complete enumeration sampling and
purposive-convenience method because the respondents of the study were
customers who were available during the time of the distribution of the survey
questionnaires and employees who were directly involved in the commercial
loans collection management of the Mindanao Consolidated Cooperative

Bank,

The overall rating of the collection management evaluation for
employees is 2.43 with a verbal description of Sometimes and for customers, it
iS 2.14 with a verbal description of Sometimes.

The researchers found out that the procedure of collection management
that is being set by the company was leniently implemented. Among the

procedures, the implementation of litigation was lenient based on the
vi
standards since the company has never reach into the point of litigation from

the year 2012-2017 (May).

The researchers proposed to strictly implement the collection
management standards and promptly remind and follow up the borrower
before or after the borrowers scheduled payment date to have consistent

"CASE ABSTRACT

Manpower utilization is a business concept that describes effectively
how a business uses its manpower or employees. Businesses commonly use
the concept of manpower utilization to evaluate output in relation to labor
costs. Businesses use this concept to find new ways to more effectively
hamess the output of labor. Thus, it is the duty of the manager to find the right
person to do the right work and to allocate work according to the capabilities
of an employee. Then only manpower can be utilized effectively.
Effectiveness in manpower utilization helps the employees to find the

opportunities and to perform accordingly.

The study aimed to evaluate and assess the manpower utilization of
Wat Ever Family KTV Bar, in terms of job description, work scheduling,
supervision and workload, which affect the productivity of the employees who
are directly working in the operations. The primary data will come from the
respondents which are the employees of Wat Ever family KTV Bar; which
consist of cashiers, waiters, barmen, kitchen crews and utilities and it will be
through interviews and survey questionnaire. The secondary data will be from
books, journal article and websites based from the researchers readings,

previous studies, published and unpublished thesis relevant to the study.

The study used the descriptive research method; the researchers
utilized the whole population of Wat Ever Family KTV Bar who are directly
working in the operations. The frequency distribution was used in organizing

the data while frequency distribution table using weighted mean was used
presenting the results of the ratings. The tool used to analyze the weighted
mean of the job description, work scheduling, supervision and workload was
Likert Scale.

The researchers carefully analyzed the results of the study so that in
one way or another it could some help the management of Wat Ever Family
KTV Bar on its decision making on improving such categories: job

description, work Scheduling, supervision and workload that affect the

productivity of the employees.

The tables disclosed that among the four categories, its over-all
weighted mean is 1.2 which means that majority of the category not applied at
all and the manpower utilization is ineffective. With these results it can be
concluded that Wat Ever Family KTV Bars employees in terms of job
description, work scheduling, Supervision and workload is ineffective and that

it greatly affects the productivity of the employees.

The researchers proposed the following recommendations. For the job
description ;for each employee, a good job description helps the employees to
understand their duties and responsibilities, their relative importance of their
duties and how their position contributes to the mission, goals and objectives
of the organization. Contribute to organizational effectiveness by ensuring that

the work carried out by staff is aligned with the organization's mission.

Work Scheduling

The management should consider peak hours when allocating the

number of employees per shift. The employees will appreciate working for a
business that cares about their leisure time. Take employeesâ€™ preferences into
account when scheduling. Distribute highly sought after shifts evenly among
employees as much as possible. Also ask them which days or hours they
have problems with in order to avoid ""violating"" their preferences. The chart
for the schedule should be posted so that it is easy for team members to view

and access it.
Supervision

Support employee's conditions for their motivation. Observe employees
performance and give feedback for their guidance. Tailoring work
assignments rewards and recognition to individual employee needs and
desires. The supervisor needs to consider not only what each employee is
capable of doing but also what assignments will provide challenges and

development opportunities to employees.
Workload

The store manager should generate and implement timely strategies
for dealing with peak periods of demand such as job sharing. Assign the
workload equitably. Educate their employees by providing knowledge on
topics relevant to managing workload, stress management and burnout.

The billing experience has a clear, direct and strong influence on
overall patient satisfaction, especially because it is the last interaction a

patient's likelihood to return to that provider in the future. With this, the study
aimed to evaluate the billing process of Agusan Del Norte Provincial Hospital.

involved in the billing process. The study focused on the assessment of the
billing process of Agusan Del Norte Provincial Hospital. It specifically limits on
the following station; Nurse Station; Laboratory; Pharmacy, X-ray/ Ultrasound;
Billing Section; Social Worker and Cashier. The study used the descriptive
method using the research made survey questionnaire. With the. aid, the
Slovene's formula the researchers were able to identify forty (40) out of fifty
(50) clients in the hospital as the respondents of the study by using purposive
convenience sampling technique. The Likert scale model was used to
evaluate the billing process of Agusan Del Norte Provincial Hospital. Thus the

"CASE ABSTRACT

This research is entitled ""Inventory Control of Banaybanay Dry Good
Storeâ€. This study was conducted in Banaybanay Dry Good Store at Taglatawan,
Bayugan City.

The concerned of the study was to evaluate the inventory control of
Banaybanay Dry Goods Store.

The scope of this study was focuses on the evaluation of the inventory
control of Banaybanay Dry Goods Store specifically physical counting on
receiving, releasing, reporting and recording of inventory which based on the
annual record of the store. There are a total of 9 respondents from the store
which are the manager and the staffs who were knowledgeable about the
inventory control of the store. Also the primary data is through research interview
with the management and employee. Secondary sources are from the customers
and the related studies.

The researchers used the descriptive method, to assess the practices
and procedures for controlling the inventory. Also, the researchers used
purposive sampling and complete enumeration; it is purposive because the
respondents were selected directly from the employee of the store, and it was
complete enumeration because all the nine (9) employee of Banaybanay Dry
Goods store was considered as respondents. The researchers used the

frequency distribution in organizing the data. Data were presented using the
central tendency measures; weighted mean; in the frequency distribution table,

the Likert Scale was used to analyze the data gathered.
The result showed that the evaluation of inventory control of Banaybanay
Dry Good Store was applied in most or majority cases which are effective as
perceived by the respondents. This was further supported by the results of the
study that among the four areas of the study; the Reporting Inventory Control
Processes had the weighted mean of 2.22, and Recording Inventory Control
Processes with the weighted mean of 2.24, which were seldom applied by the
respondents, the result means that the respondents applied in few cases which is
less effective.

As concluded, after thorough evaluation, it was found out that the
Inventory Control processes implemented by Banaybanay Dry Good Store was
quite effective, despite of the issues raised by the customers. Yet, in terms of
recording and reporting of inventories, these were the areas that require
improvements, for these might be the sources of the existing problem of the
business. Therefore the researcher recommends that management should
implement the appropriate internal controls such as; providing index card with
information about the product, listing of remained items in detailed (quality, color,
sizes, and styles) and determine the fast and slow moving items to provide the

"This study aims to evaluate the inventory process of ANG
YEE Enterprise which is a small-scale hardware located in
Barangay San Vicente, Butuan City. The proponents of this case
study have determined the inventory flow from the preparation of
purchase order to a payment of said items. However, the research
is specifically geared towards identifying areas of concern which is
the storing, arranging and labeling process of the aforementioned
hardware and eventually provides proposals and recommendations
that will be feasible and reasonable to the current predicament of

the company.

The researchers used descriptive research method since it
involves the gathering of data that describes events and situations
which then organized into useful and relevant information. The
respondents, which represent the total population, comprising of the
owner and his employees were subjected to interviews and survey.
The researchers also conducted actual field observation during the

duration of this study.

Results of the survey showed that its inventory process was
occasionally practiced with an overall mean of 2.44 which is
verbally described as SOMETIMES. Under the category of

STORING, the overall mean is 3.21 which means OFTEN
practiced, 2.70 or OFTEN practiced under ARRANGEMENT and
1.42 or NEVER practiced under LABELING. Based on the results, it
can be concluded that the enterprise lacks the proper methods and
practices in the process of storing, arranging and labeling its
inventory. This is due to the fact that the business does not
regularly check its inventory for any sign of defect and deterioration.
With regard to the arrangement, items are not grouped according to
function typically found in a hardware store. On labeling, the

business does not have any form or system of labeling.

Several adjustments and changes could improve the current
inventory process of the enterprise. About the STORING, inventory
should be checked weekly for any sign of damage and
deterioration. Items should be arranged, organized and grouped
according to the most basic grouping of items in a hardware store in
order to avoid items getting mixed-up up with other items. Products
and all forms of storage materials should be labeled accordingly
with the appropriate names and pictures. By having a systematic

"This research is entitled ""Collection Mechanism of Solid Employees
Development Cooperative"". This study was conducted in J.C. Aquino, Libertad,

Butuan City.
The concerned of the study was to evaluate the Collection Mechanism of
Solid Employees Development Cooperative.

The scope of this study was focuses on the evaluation of the collection
mechanism of Solid Employees Development Cooperative specifically the
mechanism used in collecting defaults account based on the annual collection
of the cooperative. There are 7 respondents from the cooperative which are the
manager and from the credit committee who were knowledgeable about the
collection mechanism of the cooperative.

The researchers used the descriptive method, to evaluate the
mechanism for collecting the unpaid debts. Also, the researchers used
purposive sampling and complete enumeration; it is purposive because the

respondents were selected directly from the employee of the cooperative, and it
was complete enumeration because all the seven (7) employee of Solid
Employees Development Cooperative was considered as respondents. The
researchers used the frequency distribution in organizing the data. Data were
presented using the central tendency measures; weighted mean; in the

frequency distribution table, the Likert Scale was used to analyze the data

gathered.

The result showed that the evaluation of Collection Mechanism used in

the cooperative was need an improvement, it was found out that the Collection
Mechanism processes implemented by Solid Employees Development was
occasionally practiced and used. Therefore the researcher recommends that
management should implement the appropriate internal controls such as; the
collection strategies, the process to manage outstanding debts, mode of
payment, the collection process, the arrears of member's monthly amortization,
reasons for not paying the monthly amortization, the collection mechanism
existed in the cooperative and especially the other collection mechanism that

"Agusan Del Norte teachers, retirees, employees and community, one
of the Cooperatives in Butuan City, has been experiencing an increase in
delinquent amount of loans and are facing a challenge in collecting payments
from the borrowers from the year 2013 up to 2015. The purpose of this study

is to assess the implementation of its collection policy.

The specific areas of the study are the credit reminders, payment
alternatives, monitoring and follow ups and litigation. The respondents are the
regular members and associate members, these are the members allowed for
loans. The researchers of this study used the descriptive method for the
purpose of evaluation in this case. The survey questionnaire served as a way

of collecting the data of 60 respondents.

The researchers found out that the current collection policy of
ANTRECCO Libertad is fairly implemented and followed. They concluded that

the cooperative is lenient in imposing its collection policy.

The researchers recommend that if the member has no positive
response to their obligation, the cooperative must file a lawsuit against the
debtor so that there will be a settlement in both parties on how the debt will be

"CASE ABSTRACT

This research is entitled ""Credit Assessment of Baikal Lending Investor
Corporation-Butuan"". This study was conducted in Barangay 8 Lapu-Lapu,
Cupin Compound, Butuan City. This study aims to assess the existing credit
assessment of Baikal Lending Investor Corporation-Butuan, specifically on the
four (4) Câ€™s of credit such: the character, capacity, capital and the collateral.

The primary data came from the questionnaire made by the
researchers to be answered by the target respondents who are the existing
borrowers residing at Barangay 8 Lapu-Lapu. The secondary data came from
the books and internet access. The researchers used the descriptive method
to assess the existing credit assessment of Baikal Lending Investor
Corporation-Butuan.

Also, the researchers used purposive-convenience sampling in the
selection of the respondents. It is purposive sampling because the
respondents are those active borrowers. Convenience sampling because the
respondents are those twenty four (24) active borrowers who live in Barangay
8 Lapu-Lapu, CupinCompound, Butuan City.

The researchers used the frequency distribution in organizing the
data. Data were presented using the central tendency measures using the
weighted mean the Likert Scale was used to analyze the data gathered.

The Baikal Lending Investor Corporation-Butuan had experienced a

huge amount in bad debts for the year 2014. The management stated that if
the bad debts will continue to increase, there is a possibility of unrecovered

loss which affects companyâ€™s financial stability.

Therefore, when credit assessment is not followed and implemented to

the loan applicants and active borrowers, the company will experience the
same problem in the future.

The Baikal Lending _ Investor Corporation-Butuan needs to

"Baug CARP Beneficiaries Multi-Purpose Cooperative or BCBMPC
Butuan Branch has been experiencing an increase of delinquent accounts and
as a result are facing a challenge in collecting payments from the member
borrowers which lead into a higher possibility of defaults. The purpose of this

study is to evaluate the implementation of its collection policy.

The specific areas of the study are the payment reminders, monitoring
and follow ups, payment alternatives and litigation in microfinance loan. The
respondents are the account officers who are involved in collecting delinquent
accounts and selected delinquent member borrowers. The researchers of this

study used descriptive method for the purpose of evaluation of this case.

The researchers found out that the current collection policy of BCBMPC
Butuan Branch are rarely implemented and followed. Therefore concluded that

the cooperative is lenient in imposing its collection policy.

The researchers recommend that the cooperative should hire a
collection agency. Second, the cooperative should strengthen their litigation
process through filing a lawsuit against the delinquent member borrowers. And

"The study evaluated the implementation of cash management of Peak
Foods Processing in Dona Rosario, Tubay, Agusan Del Norte specifically on
the cash budget, cash disbursement, cash collections and cash monitoring.
The study used a descriptive research method to investigate the cash
management of Peak Foods Practices.

The study employed purposive-complete enumeration sampling where
the respondents of the study are the general manager, finance in-charge, and
bookkeeper involved in the cash management of Peak Foods Processing.
The respondents were surveyed through questionnaires and interviews.

The findings revealed that the practices of cash management that is
being implemented by the company were lenient.

The findings implied that in order to solve the cash management
problem of Peak Foods Processing, the researchers proposed that itâ€™s better
that the finance in-charge should provide an expansion or more than the
minimum amount of cash required to allow for some margin of error in
planning. Every transaction should be approved by the general manager with
supporting documents. The company should strictly implement their collection
process and minimize the collection period and follow the 15 days grace
period of every transaction. The bookkeeper should prepare and submit a
daily cash report to the general manager. And record all the collected cash

"Assessment in the implementation of Collection Management of Manapa
Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries and Community Cooperative at Km.12, Purok 5,
Manapa, Buenavista, Agusan del Norte, was determined. There were three
areas of collection management employed (payment alternatives, monitoring
and follow-ups, and litigation). The researchers used purposive-complete
enumeration and random sampling method for both employees and
delinquent member borrowers. Also, used modified Likert Scale to analyzed
the data gathered. A total of 97 respondents were surveyed. Among the three
areas of collection management, payment alternatives got the highest
average weighted mean of 2.76 and 2.6 as both perceived by employees and
member borrowers with a verbal description of Often. It was followed by
monitoring and follow-ups with an average weighted mean of 2.68 and 2.53
as perceived by employees and member borrowers with both verbal
description of Often. The litigation got the lowest average weighted mean of
1.76 and 1.80 with a verbal description of Sometimes as perceived by
employees and member borrowers. Based on the results of the study, the

MARBCC was lenient in the implementation of its collection management that

leads to higher delinquent accounts that may affected the operation of the

cooperative. Thus, the researchers would like to recommend the following:

First is that the cooperative should hire an additional collector within the

member. Second, they must fully implement their policy with regards to co-

makers. Third, they should undergo litigation process through filing a lawsuit

against delinquent member borrowers. Fourth, they should send text message

"CASE ABSTRACT

This study aims to assess the existing credit policy of Uhland Loans
Corporation to come up with a possible solution, or at least to minimize the
current problem which is the increasing of defaulted accounts, and
appropriate recommendations for the company. The study focused mainly on
Uhland Loans Corporation Main Branchâ€™s credit policy assessment under
Salary Loan accounts, its active clients in the year 2014 up to the first quarter
of 2015. Active clients under Salary Loan accounts who observed the
implementation of credit policy from New Applicant Officer to Chief Loan
Officer in the main branch are the primary sources of the data. The type of
research methodused in this study is Descriptive Research. The findings of
the study reveal that the credit policy is occasionally practiced that leads to
problems during repayment. Factors that cause defaulted were identified as
follows: incomplete requirements are toleratedupon submission of required
documents, ATM card was the sole collateral needed to acquire a loan which
indicates an unsecured loan. As Epstein and Graham (1991) pointed,
collateral reduces the risk of default. It must be that the company must have
to retrieve from the borrower when the loan is subject to default, the
unpracticed credit investigation through residence visitation must be
executed. A residence visitation verifies all the information provided by the
borrower, Journal Le PropriÃ©taire (2011), it will be the basis of whether the
person is creditworthy, credit orientation must always be done before a loan
application to ensure both loan applicants and co-makers awareness

regarding the covenant they are about to sign into. The researchers
â€”_

recommend the company to follow the credit policies, conduct a thorough
credit investigation and credit orientation for loan applicants and co-makers

"CASE ABSTRACT

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cash management of GDC
eBOX Travel Agency. The scope of this study is within the vicinity of GDC
eBOX Travel Agency. There were only (2) respondents; the owner and
manager who were the knowledgeable persons of the operation of the
agency. This study includes areas in cash management namely; budgeting,
cash handling, replenishment and credit granting/monitoring. The method
used in the study is descriptive research where data were gathered through
oral interview and survey questionnaire. It indicates that the result of the over-
all rating is disagree, which means that the agency implemented and followed
the cash management practices occasionally, thereby resulting to fairly
managed cash.

From the foregoing findings, it was found out that the areas in
budgeting and cash handling got the lowest weighted mean with a verbal
description of disagree. It is recommended that in its budgeting, the agency
should handle its revenue or cash at bank properly by making it useful for the
agency's growth and sustainability. While in its cash handling, it is
recommended that when the load reaches its minimum level, reorder should
be readily applied to avoid further delays whenever the middleman has

"CASE ABSTRACT

The study evaluated the practices of credit management of LIGHT
Microfinance Incorporated in Brgy. San Ignacio Montilla Blvd. Butuan Branch
on areas of credit application, investigation, and approval. The descriptive
research method was used to evaluate the practices of the credit management
of the company. This study employed purposive-complete enumeration
sampling where the respondents are the employees who were involved in the
credit management and used a purposive-convenience sampling method to a
total of one hundred eighty-two (182) clients of LIGHT Microfinance as
respondents. The result showed that as perceived by the employee under credit
application and credit investigation has the average mean of 2.47 with a verbal
description of sometimes while as seen by the clients it has the average
weighted mean of 2.48 with a verbal description of sometimes. The findings
further revealed that the credit management practices of LIGHT Microfinance
Incorporated were occasionally practiced that contribute to their problem of an
increase of delinquent accounts. The researchers proposed recommendations
to minimize the problem of delinquent accounts. Recommendations include the
following: the company must strictly require the clients to submit all the needed
requirements as well as to conduct a loan orientation for new and old clients.
Furthermore the client must have a co-maker that should be a non-client of the
company, must have a thorough investigation to have a firm basis in the
decision of granting loans or not, must hire or assign a collector, must review,

"CASE ABSTRACT

BCMPC or Bohol Community Multi-Purpose Cooperative, a satellite
office located in Nasipit, Agusan del Norte, with its main branch in Bohol, has
been experiencing an increasing number of delinquent payers of loan in the
year 2014-2016 transactions. Eventhough the cooperative has established a
collection policy, the cooperative is still experiencing difficulty in collecting
payments from debtors that will lead to slow loan recovery and may influence

the liquidity of the cooperative. The study aims to evaluate the implementation

of the collection policy.

The specific areas of the study are the credit reminders, monitoring and
follow-up, payments altematives and litigation. The respondents are the
employees and regular members of the cooperative. The researchers of this
study use descriptive method for the purpose of evaluation in this case. The
survey questionnaires serve as a way of collecting the data from the (50) fifty

respondents.

The researchers found out that the current collection policy of BCMPC
is rarely implemented and followed. They concluded that the cooperative is

lenient in imposing its collection policy.
The researchers recommend that the cooperative must apply litigation
against the borrower only if the

rÃ© IS NO positive response to the credit reminders and monitoring and follow

ups knowing that filing a legal case is a long process and is very costly and
might destroy the relationship between the members. The cooperative should
hire a collection agency to pursue the payments of delinquent accounts. In
rewards for punctual or on-time payment, the cooperative should grants
reward at least 1% discount to debtors who will pay a week or so before due
date to encourage the debtor to pay on time. In penalties for late payments,

"CASE ABSTRACT

The researchers conducted a study entitled Evaluation on the Business
Performance of Malambuon Multi-Purpose Cooperative in Brgy. Dumalagan, Butuan
City. Well, assessed Homogenous Purposive Sampling Method was used for
gathering data. A modified survey questionnaire was developed, and a frequency
distribution table was used for the weighted mean and used a Likert Scale to analyze
data. There were 134 sample questionnaires for the member and 22 sample
questionnaires for the management staff employed during the study. The study was
conducted from June up to December 2018. The result of the evaluation showed that
in the area of Learning and growth perspective obtained the highest weighted mean

of 2.97. For Customers perspective, it obtained the lowest weighted mean of 2.55
which both demonstrates contentment m the operatronat and fnanctat pertormance

of the cooperative. It results that in terms of Customer's perspective and Learning
and growth perspective the management staff and coop members are both
contented and satisfied with the performance of the cooperative. However, if this will
continue it will create dissatisfaction to the members because some of their wants
and needs are not attained and performed. Hence, it was recommended that
Malambuon Multi-Purpose Cooperative should offer livelihood and entrepreneurial
loans to its members to assist for them to have their capital, the cooperative must tap

"CASE ABSTRACT

The researchers conducted a study entitled Assessing Customer Satisfaction
in terms of Physical Environment of We Care Fitness Gym in South Montilla
Boulevard, Brgy. J.P.Rizal, Butuan City, Agusan Del Norte. Well assessed
Purposive-Convenience Sampling Method was used for gathering data. A
modified survey questionnaire was developed, and a frequency distribution
table was used for the weighted mean and used a Likert Scale to analyze
data. There were 50 sample questionnaires used for the respondents during
the survey. The study was conducted from June 2018 up to December 2018.
The result of the evaluation showed that in the area of Ambient Condition

Gym have an accurate atmosphere that customers feel comfortable to
perform physical fitness. Signs and Symbols, it reveals that the fitness gym
has proper signage and symbols inside and outside the gym. The Spatial
Layout reveals that the fitness gym does not have enough space for the
equipment as well as the arrangement and design of the gym. The
Functionality obtained the lowest weighted mean of 2.29; it reveals that the
functionality of the equipment of We Care Fitness Gym did not meet the
customer's expectation. This study stated that the customers are not satisfied
with the overall condition of the physical environment of We Care Fitness
Gym which leads to having a dissatisfied customer. This study will help We
Care Fitness Gym to know what would be the changes they could make to
Satisfy the customers. Hence, it was recommended that We Care Fitness
Gym manager should engage more into enhancing the physical environment

CASE ABSTRACT

The purpose of the study is to appraise the current performance of the
light equipment specifically cement mixer and generator and help the
management to create good decision making about the problem. The focus of
the study is to appraise the cement mixer and generator used by the company

in terms of its Usability, Condition, and Quality output.

Due to confidentiality of the identity of the customer of the company,
we donâ€™t have customer sentiments. The respondents of the study is limited
only to those people who is affected with use of the cement mixer and

generator

The descriptive method is used by the researcher for this study
because this will help to appraise the light equipment specifically cement

mixer and generator.

The study reveals that the companyâ€™s cement mixer is less effective in
terms of Usability, Condition and Quality output. The effectivity of the cement
mixer affects the performance of the company because the cement mixer is a
vital part of the build. Cement mixer creates the materials needed for the
foundation of any horizontal and vertical project. It also reveals that the
respondents experienced in few instances that the generator is less useful.
Generator is an important part of constructing a project because generator
provides electricity which is used by the other light equipment such as
wielding machine in which wields the braces needed for the foundation of any

horizontal and vertical projects.

The appraisal of current performance of the light equipment has
revealed that the cement mixer and generator is less useful this could affect
the performance of the company because the company has delayed finish
projects. Continues use of the dilapidated light equipment will increase the

expense of the company due to rent and repair of the light equipment.

The researcher of this study recommends that the company must buy
more new equipment so that the company has its own back up equipment in
case of their equipment fails to work in the middle of a project. The existing
old equipment must be sell so that the company can gain profit on it or
convert that profit as an additional cash for paying the new investment. This
investment might be costly but this also gives the company to maximize their
profit lessen the probable cost that is increasing because of renting
equipment. Which could mean that the investment has the highest rate of

CASE ABSTRACT

Customer Satisfaction on its services offered is a very important concept a
company must understand in order to remain competitive in business and grow.
It is very important for companies to know and assess the customer satisfaction

because it leads to higher customer satisfaction, profitability, reduced cost,

customer loyalty and retention.

The main purpose of this study is to assess the Customer Satisfaction of
Cristal in terms of its Services offered. A survey questionnaire (rating scale) was
used to assess the level of Customer Satisfaction in terms of services offered.
The sampling technique used is The Purposive â€” Complete enumeration
sampling design. Purposive because respondents were selected directly from the
master list of active customers of Cristal Press and Complete enumeration
because all the Twenty (20) active customers of Cristal Press were considered
respondents. Respondents answer the questionnaire and assess the level of
customers satisfaction in terms of services offered of Cristal Press. In presenting
the result of the study, descriptive statistics such as Weighted Mean and
Frequency Distribution Table (FDT) data were used to illustrate the collected
data. The likert scale presented below is used in analyzing the data.

The companyâ€™s general rating of customer Satisfaction revealed that it falls
within the category of Satisfied which can be construed to be on the average

level only. This means that the company was not able to excel on anything but
\

no dimension is being rated less satisfied, all results however disclosed being
satisfied or just in the average level. The company can make better
improvements to reach much satisfied which is above average or very much
satisfied which is far above average.

This study recommends that Cristal Press should put more efforts to
improve its services particularly with emphasis on the five dimensions. Areas
under each dimension whose results are less satisfied should be given more
attention to attain satisfaction level. To elevate the level of Customer Satisfaction
from satisfied to much satisfied and very much satisfied add more machines
which is high-tech and modernized to be productive and to compete in todayâ€™s
competitive market. Management should determine training needs of employee
to acquire or enhance new skills, to enhance behavior and courtesy towards the
customer and to prepare them for higher responsibilities on the use of new high
tech and modernized machines. It will be an advantage of the company because
they can create promotions in terms of high technology used, a very productive
printing institution and a service efficient in terms of delivering products on time.

CASE ABSTRACT
The study was started in the management of Chowking agreed our
letter to conduct research on their company. The researchers conducted a
study in Chowking.Since the study was started, the researchers find that
recruitment and selection process is one of the problems of the restaurant.
But unfortunately, it is the performance appraisal of outsourced employees
since they were hired was the issue of the managers of Chowking. So the
researcher did a study on how to assess the performance appraisal of
outsourced employees in Chowking. The researchers made a survey
questionnaire that only managers will answer to evaluate and quantify the
result regarding the crew's performance appraisal then to create a real data.
The researchers used the descriptive method to describe and assess the
performance appraisal of crews. After the result came up, it shows that the
performance appraisal of crews has been rated fair that falls to below
standards and expectation. All questions have rated fair. The job knowledge,
comprehension and _ intelligence, interpersonal relation, physical energy,
initiative, punctuality and attendance, the attitude of work, industry, respect
and honesty. Although no questions haven't rated poor but still the managers
wants the crews to still improve and exert more effort of their performance
appraisal. Since the result was already showed, the researchers made a
recommendation to help the management of Chowking regarding of their
problems. The researchers want that management must strictly implement the
codes of discipline in Chowking. That management of Chowking must apply

for more benefits and give other incentives to the crews to perform their work

better. So that crews will more determine and motivated to work. The

CASE ABSTRACT

The objective of the study is to evaluate Cost management of PAN de
PUGON, located at 1342 J.C Aquino Avenue, Butuan City (Franchise).

Specifically, on its planning, monitoring and controlling.

The researchers use descriptive method in the study because it

describes the cost management procedures and practices of Pan de Pugon.

The overall ratings of cost management in PAN de PUGON in terms of

Planning got the highest average mean of 1.90 with verbal description of
â€œsometimesâ€. Second is the monitoring which 1.86 got the weighted mean
with verbal description of â€œsometimesâ€. And the controlling got 1.55 with verbal
description of â€œneverâ€. The overall mean of the existing cost management of

Pan de Pugon is 1.77 with verbal description of â€œsometimesâ€.

Based on the result of the study Pan de Pugon was lenient in its

implementation of Cost Management. Procedures are followed but practiced

in two to few cases or instances.

As a recommendation, the management should apply the production

principle â€œBuffer stocksâ€ to meet increasing demand for the products; and be

applied during the production planning for breads and cakes. Apply also the

FIFO Method to avoid spoilage of the products. As to the planning, the

management should have a production plan that would serve as their guide:

what to produce, when to produce and how many to produce in terms of their

production. As to monitoring, the management should assign individuals,

CASE ABSTRACT

Customer Satisfaction is the quality of product and the service provided
by every organization. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the customer
Satisfaction of Brown Bag Bakeshoppe.The researchers used a primary source
of data through an in-depth interview and data collected through survey
questionnaire for dine-in respondents. A total of fifty (50) were surveyed through
the use of questionnaires and interviews. The study employed convenient
sampling where the respondents of the Study are customers who purchased
bread in the store.

Descriptive method was used to describe the Customer Satisfaction of
Brown Bakeshoppe. Likert Scale was used to express the response. The
overall rating of customer satisfaction of Brown Bag Bakeshoppe is 2.19 which
has the verbal description of Less Satisfied which is below the customer's
Satisfaction. The findings revealed that the design factors had the lowest
response in terms of customer Satisfaction, where the building painting is

already old and faded. For the store environment in terms of the ambient factor,
they should add more wall fans to lessen the temperature of the area, change
the busted lights and add more trash bins inside the store. For the design factor,
the bakeshop should repaint their whole store. In terms of social factor, the
management should have a proper uniform for their employees and conduct a

Proper orientation on how to handle customers.

CASE ABSTRACT

The study evaluated the implementation of Inventory Management of
EMCO Plywood Corporation in Magallanes, specifically on the raw materials.
The study used a descriptive research method to evaluate the inventory

management of EMCO Magallanes.

A total of four respondents were surveyed through the use of
questionnaires and interviews. The study employed purposive-complete
enumeration sampling where the respondents of the study were the Manager,
Accounting in-charge, warehousemen and the personnel in-charge involved in

the inventory management of EMCO Magallanes.

The findings revealed that the standard process of inventory
management that is being set by the company was not strictly implemented.
Among the process, the implementation of ordering and controlling process
was too lax based on the standards since the company has their own practices

in implementing inventory.

The findings showed that in order to solve the inventory management
problem of EMCO Magallanes, the researchers proposed to strictly implement

the inventory management standards. This will help the management improve

their inventory control.

CASE ABSTRACT
Pixel.Exe Tarpaulin Printing Services, one of the printing businesses in
Butuan City, has been experiencing an increase of defaulted accounts from 2012
until the present year. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the collection
practices of the firm and after such, propose an enhancement of collection
practices so as to minimize the uncollected and defaulted accounts. Moreover,
the Sc's and the level of implementation of current collection practices are
assessed. The overall principle of this research is to evaluate the collection
practices of the firm that affects the collection of accounts receivables.

The researchers of this study used a descriptive method for the purpose of
evaluation of the case, particularly the collection practices of Pixel.Exe. Through
the survey questionnaires handed to 67 respondents and interview with the
management which served as the primary data of the research, they determined
the current collection practices of the firm. The data were obtained from both
primary and secondary sources which include textbooks, articles, journals, and

the internet.

The study obtained numerous findings based on the data gathered and
interpreted. It was revealed that the current collection practices of Pixel.Exe is
ineffective in a way that it contributes to the increasing defaulted accounts of the

fim. Those collection practices involve credit agreement, credit limit, credit

period, and consistency of reminders of the firm.

The researchers recommend that the collection practices of Pixel.Exe
should include assessment of the creditworthiness of the customers who
purchase on credit. The management should also involve the written agreement
which states the terms and conditions of the credit applied. Discounts and non-
payment charges are recommended for the recovery of the partial amount of
credit granted. In line to this, consistency and persistence of collection
procedures or practices should be applied to avoid the defaulted accounts. Also,
legal actions should be taken by the firm which demands the debtors of the firm
to pay. These measures might help the firm in improving their collection of

customers who availed commercial loans and eleven (11) employees were
surveyed through the use of questionnaires and interviews. The study
employed purposive-complete enumeration sampling and
purposive-convenience method because the respondents of the study were
customers who were available during the time of the distribution of the survey

CASE ABSTRACT

The study evaluated the practices of Inventory Management of Travies
General Merchandise in Las Nieves Agusan del Norte specifically on planning
and controlling. The study used a descriptive research method to investigate

the practices of inventory management of Travies General Merchandise.

A total of thirty nine respondents were surveyed through the use of
questionnaires and interviews. The study employed purposive-complete
enumeration sampling where the respondents of the study were the
management and employees who were involved in the inventory management

of Travies General Merchandise.

The findings revealed that the inventory management practice that is
being set by the company is applied sometimes. The implementation of
planning and controlling procedure was occasionally practiced based on the
Standards since there are no specific personnel assigned to regularly monitor

and update the inventory.

The findings showed that in order to solve the problem regarding the
inventory management practices of Travies General Merchandise, the
researchers = proposed to __ strictly implement â€” the inventory
managementstandard practices through giving recommendations such as
practice contingency planning, set up level of products to be ordered, used
point of sale system and schedule a cycle counting of inventory. This will help

the management improve their inventory planning and controlling.

"CASE ABSTRACT

This study presents the Evaluation on the Principles and Practices of
Accounts Receivable Management that is adopted by Agusan Norte Transport
Service Cooperative in Villa Kananga, Butuan City. This study was descriptive
in nature for the purpose of evaluating the case and Purposive-Complete
Enumeration Sampling Method was used. There were three (3) Accounts
Receivable Management Strategies considered. Likert Scale Model was also
utilized to interpret the Accounts Receivable Management Strategies
employed. Charts, tables and figures were used to report findings. Data was
collected through a modified survey questionnaire administered to the five (5)
respondents of the cooperative. Personal interviews were also conducted to
enhance the validity of information gathered using questionnaires. The three
(3) Accounts Receivable Management Strategies composed of the areas
namely: Credit Extension Policy, Credit Collection Policy and Credit Control
and Monitoring. The results from the study revealed that Credit Extension
Policy has a weighted mean of (2.38), Credit Collection Policy has a weighted
mean of (2.10) and Credit Control and Monitoring has a weighted mean of
(2.13), respectively. All of these strategies were implemented and followed in

few or rare instances in the Accounts Receivable Management Strategies
based on the Likert Scale Model Interpretation. Thus, all of the three (3)
Accounts Receivable Management Strategies constitutes a significant portion
and plays as an important component in the effective management of

"CASE ABSTRACT

The study evaluated the practices of credit management of LIGHT
Microfinance Incorporated in Brgy. San Ignacio Montilla Blvd. Butuan Branch
on areas of credit application, investigation, and approval. The descriptive
research method was used to evaluate the practices of the credit management
of the company. This study employed purposive-complete enumeration
sampling where the respondents are the employees who were involved in the
credit management and used a purposive-convenience sampling method to a
total of one hundred eighty-two (182) clients of LIGHT Microfinance as
respondents. The result showed that as perceived by the employee under credit
application and credit investigation has the average mean of 2.47 with a verbal
description of sometimes while as seen by the clients it has the average
weighted mean of 2.48 with a verbal description of sometimes. The findings
further revealed that the credit management practices of LIGHT Microfinance
Incorporated were occasionally practiced that contribute to their problem of an
increase of delinquent accounts. The researchers proposed recommendations
to minimize the problem of delinquent accounts. Recommendations include the
following: the company must strictly require the clients to submit all the needed
requirements as well as to conduct a loan orientation for new and old clients.
Furthermore the client must have a co-maker that should be a non-client of the
company, must have a thorough investigation to have a firm basis in the
decision of granting loans or not, must hire or assign a collector, must review,

"CASE ABSTRACT

The Evaluation of Credit and Collection Practices of Fundline Finance
Corporation Butuan City Branch was assessed. The study aimed to evaluate
credit and collection practices based on a credit application, credit
investigation, credit approval, credit terms, and collection policy. While the
study used the descriptive method and purposive-complete enumeration. A
total of nine (9) respondents were subjected. Moreover, a four-point Likert
Scale was also used to interpret and analyze the data gathered. Results
showed that the highest average mean 3.06 with a verbal description of Often
under the area of credit application. It was followed by an average mean of
280 with a verbal description of Often under collection policy area. An
average mean of 2.71 with a verbal description of Often under the credit
approval area was on the third line. The second lowest average mean was
2 31 with a verbal description of Sometimes under credit application area. The
lowest mean was 1.64 with a verbal description of Never under the domain of
credit term. It indicates that Fundline Finance Corporation was lenient in its
implementation of credit and collection policy. Therefore, they need proper
implementation following their manual so that the company would not
experience high delinquency accounts. The researchers recommend that the
corporation must have an appropriate designation of work of the employees to
separate the workplace of each employee. Also, the corporation should hire
more financial consultants to become efficient in collecting everyday payment
and delinquent accounts. In rewards for early payment, the corporation should
grant a discount to customers who would pay on time or before the due date.
For the late paying customer, the corporation should charge penalties by
canceling their credit line and do not allow them to re-loan. Thus, evaluating

"CASE ABSTRACT

The researchers conducted a study entitled Evaluation on the Business
Performance of Malambuon Multi-Purpose Cooperative in Brgy. Dumalagan, Butuan
City. Well, assessed Homogenous Purposive Sampling Method was used for
gathering data. A modified survey questionnaire was developed, and a frequency
distribution table was used for the weighted mean and used a Likert Scale to analyze
data. There were 134 sample questionnaires for the member and 22 sample
questionnaires for the management staff employed during the study. The study was
conducted from June up to December 2018. The result of the evaluation showed that
in the area of Learning and growth perspective obtained the highest weighted mean
of 2.97. For Customers perspective, it obtained the lowest weighted mean of 2.55
which both demonstrates contentment in the operational and financial performance
of the cooperative. It results that in terms of Customer's perspective and Learning
and growth perspective the management staff and coop members are both
contented and satisfied with the performance of the cooperative. However, if this will
continue it will create dissatisfaction to the members because some of their wants
and needs are not attained and performed. Hence, it was recommended that
Malambuon Multi-Purpose Cooperative should offer livelihood and entrepreneurial
loans to its members to assist for them to have their capital, the cooperative must tap

CASE ABSTRACT

The study evaluated the implementation of Inventory Management of
EMCO Plywood Corporation in Magallanes, specifically on the raw matenals.
The study used a descriptive research method to evaluate the inventory

management of EMCO Magallanes.

A total of four respondents were surveyed through the use of
questionnaires and interviews. The study employed purposive-complete
enumeration sampling where the respondents of the study were the Manager,
Accounting in-charge, warehousemen and the personnel in-charge involved in

the inventory management of EMCO Magallanes.

The findings revealed that the standard process of inventory
management that is being set by the company was not strictly implemented.
Among the process, the implementation of ordering and controlling process
was too lax based on the standards since the company has their own practices

in implementing inventory.

The findings showed that in order to solve the inventory management
problem of EMCO Magallanes, the researchers proposed to strictly implement

the inventory management standards. This will help the management improve

their inventory control.

CASE ABSTRACT
Media used by Gloreto Suite in Montilla Street,

e was determined. Purposive-Convenience
were three (3) Advertising

Effectiveness in the Advertising
Butuan City, Agusan Del Nort
Sampling Method was used in the study. There
Media considered. Likert-Scale Model was utilized to interpret the advertising

media employed. A total of 64 respondents were chosen to answer the
questionnaires. Among the three (3) advertising media: Flier, Facebook Page,
and Tarpaulin, the result shows that Tarpaulin obtained the highest weighted
mean of (2.08) with a verbal description of the fair which means it only slightly
influenced customers to avail the offered service, hence, less effective. On the
other hand, Flier got the overall weighted mean of (1.75), and the Facebook
page also got (1.73). This further means that these two (2) advertising media
were ineffective in influencing customers to avail the offered service of the
company based on the Likert-Scale Model Interpretation. Herein, the
management fails to manage consistently its advertising media especially its
facebook page which has a higher possibility of reaching a large number of
potential customers. Furthermore, the number of fliers and tarpaulins produced
were not enough in raising awareness of the existence of the business. Hence,
there is a need for the company to change the way it advertised the
establishment by improving the attributes, performance, and execution of its

CASE ABSTRACT

The study evaluated the practices of Inventory Management of Travies
General Merchandise in Las Nieves Agusan del Norte specifically on planning
and controlling. The study used a descriptive research method to investigate

the practices of inventory management of Travies General Merchandise.

A total of thirty nine respondents were surveyed through the use of
questionnaires and interviews. The study employed purposive-complete
enumeration sampling where the respondents of the study were the
management and employees who were involved in the inventory management

of Travies General Merchandise.

The findings revealed that the inventory management practice that is
being set by the company is applied sometimes. The implementation of
planning and controlling procedure was occasionally practiced based on the
standards since there are no specific personnel assigned to regularly monitor

and update the inventory.

The findings showed that in order to solve the problem regarding the
inventory management practices of Travies General Merchandise, the
researchers proposed to strictly implement â€” the inventory
managementstandard practices through giving recommendations such as
practice contingency planning, set up level of products to be ordered, used
point of sale system and schedule a cycle counting of inventory. This will help

the management improve their inventory planning and controlling.

"CASE ABSTRACT

Pera Multi-Purpose Cooperative Butuan Branch has been experiencing an
increase in the delinquent amount of SSS pension loans from the year 2015
to 2017. The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the collection policy
and to the alteration of non-value adding procedures. The specific areas of
the study are the grace period, payment alternative, monitoring, and follow-up
and litigation. The researchers of this study used descriptive method for the
evaluation of this case. The study used the purposive-complete enumeration
sampling method, Frequency Distribution Table in summary and presentation
of data and weighted mean together with the qualitative description in the
evaluation of the procedures. The given grace period had an average
weighted mean of 2.40 with a verbal description of Less Effective. Payment
alternative had an average weighted mean of 2.52 with a verbal description of
Effective. Monitoring and follow-ups with an average weighted mean of 2.80
with a verbal description of Effective. And litigation had an average weighted
mean of 2.28 with a verbal description of Less Effective. The researchers
found out that the current collection policy of Pera MPC in the delinquent
account is less effective. The researchers recommended that the cooperative
must give a grace period of up to 15 days only. Second, the cooperative must
apply litigation consistently against the delinquent borrowers in accordance
with the time frame designated in taking legal action to make the sending of
2â„¢4 and final demand letter effective. Third, the cooperative must take into
reality the use of co-makers. Fourth, the cooperative must accept pledges
from delinquent borrower specifically those pledges that carry value for sale.
Fifth, the cooperative must offer a savings account. Lastly, the cooperative

"CASE ABSTRACT

This study aimed to evaluate the collection management of Isomedical
Ventures Incorporated to come up with possible solution, in order to minimize
or prevent the current problem of the company which is the increasing of
overdue accounts or uncollected payments. The study focuses on the private
customers since the problem are on the private customers. Also, the focus of
the study consist of four (4) areas, the monitoring, planning, billing, and
reminder and follow-up. The study used the purposive and complete
enumeration in choosing the respondents. The researchers both considered
the employees and customers as the respondents of the study. The
employeesâ€™ response in collection monitoring, collection planning, billing and
reminder and follow-up had an average weighted mean of 2.03, 1.95, 2.40,
1.80 with a verbal description of Sometimes. In the customersâ€™ response,
collection planning, billing, reminder and follow-up had an average weighted
mean of 1.90, 2.27, 1.76 with the verbal description of Sometimes.The
collection management of Isomedical Ventures Incorporated was lenient and
observed but rarely followed which resulted to a rapid increased of overdue
accounts in private customers. Isomedical Ventures Incorporated should add
more efforts and be strict in collecting the overdue accounts of the customers
and in order for them not to be taken for granted by the customers. In

"CASE ABSTRACT

The researchers conducted a study entitled Assessing Customersâ€™ Satisfaction

in Physical Environment of Karl's Kitchenette in Buenavista, Agusan del Norte.

To assess the customer satisfaction of Karl's Kitchenette a purposive-

convenience research method is used. There were four (4) areas considered.

A modified questionnaire was developed and used a frequency distribution

table using the weighted mean. A total of 51 respondents is surveyed randomly

and able to answer the given questionnaires. Among the (4) four areas: Store

Signage, Spatial Layout, Ambiance, and Functionality results showed that
Functionality has weighted mean of (2.38), Spatial Layout (2.36), Ambiance
(2.30), and Store Signage (2.01) the result showed that all areas of physical
environment are below satisfactory and below customersâ€™ expectation in the
Likert- Scale Model Interpretation. Thus, it suggests that the signage must be
improved in size while at night time this emphasized by installing light fixtures
to be visible. As for Spatial Layout, provide a kitchen cabinet, change the
boundary wall into a sliding door and window while the Ambiance, install an Air
Conditioner, add light bulb inside the kitchenette that has a maximum wattage,
change the wall paint that was already faded, add decoration that is classy and
is in line with the new trend. Lastly, for functionality, remake the menu list, clean
the fans regularly, remodel the main door, and change the torn out part of the

CASE ABSTRACT

The researchers conducted a study entitled Customer Service
Evaluation of Priscilla City Guest House in South Montilla Boulevard Brgy.
J.P.Rizal, Butuan City. Purposive-Convenience Sampling Method was used
for gathering data. A modified survey questionnaire was developed and a
frequency distribution table was used for the weighted mean and used a Likert
Scale to analyze data. The study was conducted from August 2018 up to

November 2018.

The result of the evaluation showed that in the area of Communication
it generated the average weighted mean of 3.48. In relation to that, Priscilla
City Guest House lacks proper communication that many of its guests are
having negative feedbacks to it. In the area of Assurance, it emphasizes that
somehow the orders must be acknowledged immediately as well as its waiting
time. In the area of Tangibles, restaurant facility is at par but lacking of proper
condiments are the main concern of many of their guest. In the area of
Empathy, being responsive and attentive are somewhat Priscilla City Guest
House service crew falls short on it. Lastly, the area which generated the
lowest average weighted mean is Timeliness, 3.35. Considerably in delivering
good customer service and satisfaction, the business establishment must
practice on being timely especially when the nature of its business is food

CASE ABSTRACT

Pera Multi-Purpose Cooperative Butuan Branch has been experiencing an
increase in the delinquent amount of SSS pension loans from the year 2015
to 2017. The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the collection policy
and to the alteration of non-value adding procedures. The specific areas of
the study are the grace period, payment alternative, monitoring, and follow-up
and litigation. The researchers of this study used descriptive method for the
evaluation of this case. The study used the purposive-complete enumeration
sampling method, Frequency Distribution Table in summary and presentation
of data and weighted mean together with the qualitative description in the
evaluation of the procedures. The given grace period had an average
weighted mean of 2.40 with a verbal description of Less Effective. Payment
alternative had an average weighted mean of 2.52 with a verbal description of
Effective. Monitoring and follow-ups with an average weighted mean of 2.80
with a verbal description of Effective. And litigation had an average weighted
mean of 2.28 with a verbal description of Less Effective. The researchers
found out that the current collection policy of Pera MPC in the delinquent
account is less effective. The researchers recommended that the cooperative
must give a grace period of up to 15 days only. Second, the cooperative must
apply litigation consistently against the delinquent borrowers in accordance
with the time frame designated in taking legal action to make the sending of
2â„¢ and final demand letter effective. Third, the cooperative must take into
reality the use of co-makers. Fourth, the cooperative must accept pledges
from delinquent borrower specifically those pledges that carry value for sale.
Fifth, the cooperative must offer a savings account. Lastly, the cooperative

CASE ABSTRACT

The Evaluation of Credit and Collection Practices of Fundline Finance
Corporation Butuan City Branch was assessed. The study aimed to evaluate
credit and collection practices based on a credit application, credit
investigation, credit approval, credit terms, and collection policy. While the
Study used the descriptive method and purposive-complete enumeration. A
total of nine (9) respondents were subjected.

Moreover, a four-point Likert Scale was also used to interpret and
analyze the data gathered. Results showed that the highest average mean
3.06 with a verbal description of Often under the area of credit application. It
was followed by an average mean of 2.80 with a verbal description of Often
under collection policy area. An average mean of 2.71 with a verbal
description of Often under the credit approval area was on the third line. The
second lowest average mean was 2.31 with a verbal description of
Sometimes under credit application area. The lowest mean was 1.64 with a
verbal description of Never under the domain of credit term. It indicates that
Fundline Finance Corporation was lenient in its implementation of credit and
collection policy.

Therefore, they need proper implementation following their manual so
that the company would not experience high delinquency accounts. The
researchers recommend that the corporation must have an appropriate
designation of work of the employees to separate the workplace of each
employee. Also, the corporation should hire more financial consultants to
become efficient in collecting everyday payment and delinquent accounts. In
rewards for early payment, the corporation should grant a discount to
customers who would pay on time or before the due date. For the late paying
customer, the corporation should charge penalties by canceling their credit
line and do not allow them to re-loan. Thus, evaluating credit and collection

CASE ABSTRACT

An evaluation of the customer satisfaction of Lasar Fast-food & Restaurant
was conducted. A descriptive method of research and a purposive-
convenience sampling technique were used in gathering the data. While, a
modified questionnaire was also developed in conducting the survey. The
study was conducted from June 2018 to October 2018. In analyzing the
results of the survey, the researchers used the frequency distribution and
Likert Scale. Three (3) dimensions (functionality, layout and ambience) were
used in evaluating the physical environment of the restaurant. The result of
the evaluation showed that customers are less satisfied to the physical
environment of the Lasar Fast-food & Restaurant. This means that the
functionality, layout, and ambiance of the restaurant fails to meet the
expectation of the customers. Out of the three (3) areas assessed, layout
got the highest weighted average of 2.49 with a verbal description of less
Satisfactory which means it is below customersâ€™ expectation. On contrary,
functionality got the lowest average weighted mean of 2.33 with a verbal
description of less satisfactory which means it is also below customersâ€™
expectation level. Herein, the management fails to manage and update their
facilities for the customers. Therefore, the management should enhance and
improve the functionalities of their amenities in order to give optimal comfort

"CASE ABSTRACT

Evaluation on Inventory Management of Angging Dry Goods Store in
Buenavista, Agusan del Norte was assessed. There were areas subjected to
the study (forecasting, ordering and controlling) to help the management
change their traditional way of inventory management. The study used the
descriptive method of research and a purposive-complete enumeration
sampling method. About 8 respondents were analyzed that includes the store
manager, cashier, six sales ladies. Results showed that in evaluating the
inventory management of the store, forecasting, ordering and controlling has
a weighted mean of 2.40, 2.80, and 1.43, respectively. In terms of forecasting,
the management lacks knowledge in forecasting that causes them to have
incorrect forecasting of the demand. In ordering, the management does not
have a reorder point for their inventory which causes them to order stocks
always from their suppliers. In controlling, the management lacks control over
its inventory and failed to follow any standard practices. It was concluded that
the areas mentioned above contributed to the increasing number of slow-
moving stocks made for bargain below its Original cost which results in the
decrease of the company's net income of the said store. The management
should adopt the FIFO method and POS to have control of the inventory and

"CASE ABSTRACT
was established during the year 1958 at E. Luna
St, Butuan, 8600 Agusan Del Norte. It offers
d construction products for home-based
ditions, monitoring accounts
c areas of the study. The

Butuan Champion Hardware
Street Corner, Lopez Jaena
hardware products, machines, an
equipment. Credit limit, credit terms and con

receivable and follow-ups were the three specifi
respondents were the management and contractors of Butuan champion

Hardware. The researchers of this study used descriptive method for the
is case. For the sampling

luating and assessing th
nience sampling method for
for the employees. Among

the contractors, while random sampling method
the three areas of the study, credit terms and conditions got the highest
weighted mean of 2.82 and 2.75 as perceive by the contractors and
employees respectively with a verbal description of Often. It was followed by
monitoring and follow-ups with an average weighted mean of 2.50 as
perceived by the contractors and 2.46 as perceived by the employees with
both verbal descriptions of Sometimes. The credit limit got the lowest average
tractors and employees

weighted mean of 2.42 and 2.32 as perceived by con
respectively with a verbal description of Sometimes. Based on the result of
the study, Butuan Champion Hardware has ways to collect payments from the
contractors, but they do not have a standard credit and collection policy to be
followed. Hence, the researchers would like to recommend the following: First,
the business should conduct a credit investigation. Second, the business
should charge over the limit fee for all the contractors. Third, the business

should give a discount rate of 3% for those contractors who fully paid their
re their due date. Fourth, the business should hire an

account 15 days befo
appraiser. Fifth, the business should strictly ask for collateral when the
his credit limit. Lastly, the business should create

"CASE ABSTRACT

e the collection management of Isomedical

Ventures Incorporated to come up with possible solution, in order to minimize
or prevent the current problem of the company which is the increasing of
overdue accounts or uncollected payments. The study focuses on the private
customers since the problem are on the private customers. Also, the focus of
the study consist of four (4) areas, the monitoring, planning, billing, and
reminder and follow-up. The study used the purposive and complete
enumeration in choosing the respondents. The researchers both considered
the employees and customers as the respondents of the study. The
employeesâ€™ response in collection monitoring, collection planning, billing and
reminder and follow-up had an average weighted mean of 2.03, 1.95, 2.40,
4.80 with a verbal description of Sometimes. In the customersâ€™ response,
collection planning, billing, reminder and follow-up had an average weighted
mean of 1.90, 2.27, 1.76 with the verbal description of Sometimes. The
collection management of Isomedical Ventures Incorporated was lenient and
observed but rarely followed which resulted to a rapid increased of overdue
accounts in private customers. Isomedical Ventures Incorporated should add
more efforts and be strict in collecting the overdue accounts of the customers
and in order for them not to be taken for granted by the customers. In
addition, it should set a credit limit to avoid a higher of accounts receivable

CASE ABSTRACT

. . 1 n
This study aims to evaluate the implementation of collectio

management practices of Datalan Communication Services to come up with a

possible solution, to minimize if not totally resolve the current problem which

is the slow turnover in collecting accounts receivable and incurring of large

overdue accounts.

The focus of the study includes six (6) areas, the credit reminders,
methods of payment, rewards for punctual or on-time payment, grace period,

penalties for late payments, and process of litigation.

The study engaged the purposive convenience sampling in choosing
only those customers who were available during the routing of the survey

questionnaires for the data gathering were considered as respondents.

The over-all rating of the collection management practices evaluation is
1.97 which resulted to verbal rating of Sometimes. The implementation of
, collection management practices of Datalan Communication Services was
lenient of which practices are observed but applied in few instances which
affect the slow turnover of account receivables and incurs the large

percentage of overdue accounts.

Datalan Communication Services should add more efforts in reminding
the due accounts of the debtor and grant rewards to debtors who will pay a
week or so before due date. Datalan should strictly observe in giving

extensions of payments and pursue the litigation when debts reached one (1)

"CASE ABSTRACT

Assessment in the implementation of Collection Management of Manapa
Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries and Community Cooperative at Km.12, Purok 5,
Manapa, Buenavista, Agusan del Norte, was determined. There were three
areas of collection management employed (payment alternatives, monitoring
and follow-ups, and litigation). The researchers used purposive-complete
enumeration and random sampling method for both employees and
delinquent member borrowers. Also, used modified Likert Scale to analyzed
the data gathered. A total of 97 respondents were surveyed. Among the three
areas of collection management, payment alternatives got the highest
average weighted mean of 2.76 and 2.6 as both perceived by employees and
member borrowers with a verbal description of Often. It was followed by
monitoring and follow-ups with an average weighted mean of 2.68 and 2.53
as perceived by employees and member borrowers with both verbal
description of Often. The litigation got the lowest average weighted mean of
1.76 and 1.80 with a verbal description of Sometimes as perceived by
employees and member borrowers. Based on the results of the study, the
MARBCC was lenient in the implementation of its collection management that
leads to higher delinquent accounts that may affected the operation of the
cooperative. Thus, the researchers would like to recommend the following:
First is that the cooperative should hire an additional collector within the
member. Second, they must fully implement their policy with regards to co-
makers. Third, they should undergo litigation process through filing a lawsuit
against delinquent member borrowers. Fourth, they should send text message

"CASE ABSTRACT

The researchers conducted a study entitled Assessing Customersâ€™ Satisfaction
in Physical Environment of Karl's Kitchenette in Buenavista, Agusan del Norte.
To assess the customer satisfaction of Karl's Kitchenette a purposive-
convenience research method is used. There were four (4) areas considered.
A modified questionnaire was developed and used a frequency distribution
table using the weighted mean. A total of 51 respondents is surveyed randomly
and able to answer the given questionnaires. Among the (4) four areas: Store
Signage, Spatial Layout, Ambiance, and Functionality results showed that
Functionality has weighted mean of (2.38), Spatial Layout (2.36), Ambiance
(2.30), and Store Signage (2.01) the result showed that all areas of physical
environment are below satisfactory and below customersâ€™ expectation in the
Likert- Scale Model Interpretation. Thus, it suggests that the signage must be
improved in size while at night time this emphasized by installing light fixtures
to be visible. As for Spatial Layout, provide a kitchen cabinet, change the
boundary wall into a sliding door and window while the Ambiance, install an Air
Conditioner, add light bulb inside the kitchenette that has a maximum wattage,
change the wall paint that was already faded, add decoration that is classy and
is in line with the new trend. Lastly, for functionality, remake the menu list, clean
the fans regularly, remodel the main door, and change the torn out part of the

"CASE ABSTRACT

The study was conducted to evaluate the cash management practices of
Saint Gabriel Multi-Purpose Cooperative in Barangay Tiniwisan, Butuan City
on areas of cash control, cash forecasting, investing surplus cash, and debt
management. The study used descriptive research method to evaluate the
cash management practices of the cooperative. The study employed
purposive-complete enumeration sampling where the respondents are the
eight employees who are involved in the cash management practices of
SGMPC. The respondents of the study were surveyed through the use of
questionnaire and interview. The findings revealed that the cash management
practices was not consistently done and explicitly practiced on the areas of
cash control, cash forecasting, investing surplus cash, and debt management
that was implemented and followed leniently. The researchers proposed the
recommendations in order to help the cooperative sustain their operations
such as increasing its membership of nine (9) heads per month, encourage
students below 17 years old and require all the members to Savings deposit,
go on with the established service, shorten the cash collection period from 6-
month into 4-month term, grant and equally allocate funds to all the borrowers
as much as possible, negotiate favorable payment periods on supplies or
equipment up to 30-day period by using purchase order, set number of
borrowers in a month, invest its idle funds to earn income, invest in short term
productive investments such as livestock feeds, limit borrowings, and maintain

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Traffic Congestion Detection with Alternative Path Recommendation is
designed mainly to aid the private drivers in avoiding traffic with the use of its features

in providing real time traffic status and alternative path.

Through study, the researchers determined a number of existing applications
that have the same features and are already used by private drivers. Therefore,
researchers used the traditional transport and vehicular systems that used a V2V
communication, in which data are reliant to the users. Thus, the researchers provided
a feature that is not available to any existing application such as using a CCTV to
provide a real time traffic status and an alternative path. With these features, the
researchers believed that it could really be a good help to private drivers in order to
easily check the traffic status of a specific road, avoid traffic, and shift to routes with

less traffic congestion.

To end, the researchers therefore concluded that the Traffic Congestion

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Andiâ€™s Snackbreak Management System was conceptualized based on
the problems encountered by the management and staff with their Traditional
Processes. The management system covers the major processes mainly:
registration of product, employee profiling, assigning employee, and
assessment of orders. The study aims to turn manual system into a modernized

one. It makes the task easier and eliminates the use of manual processing.

Based on the gathered result, the system is indeed helpful in processing
the transactions. The result was weighted through the usability test scale of the
system and the scoring was based on the mathematical standard of system
usability test scale. The proponents conclude that through the use of the
proposed Management System, the owner, who will become the admin, can
manually add, collect and retrieve products and employee information, and can
also review all transaction logs Also, the cashier can follow up and check the

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The proponents have decided to develop an android phone
security application that could help mitigate the increasing number of missing
phones. The descriptive method of research was used in this study. Surveys
and interviews were conducted in order to know their experiences in losing their
smartphones. The developed application is basically a mobile application which
the user can monitor their phone if their phone is in lost mode with the help of
the features that the developer implemented. One of the objective of this study
is to develop the features in tracing and protecting your android smartphones if
ever it is stolen or gone missing and in longer term will help mitigate phone
missing cases. This will also give benefits to the users because it will somehow
lessen their worries in losing their smartphones. The proponents use a Global
Positioning System (GPS) and Google Map in their application for tracking the

lost phone and monitor it with another devices where it is registered as a backup
phone. The Proponents choose Android Operating System (aOS) in developing
the project for it has a great number people using this mobile operating system
and it is always on demand in every marketplace. The development of this
project is patterned with the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Agile

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The province of Surigao del Norte is rich in natural resources where many
investors are interested in investing when it comes to the leading industries of
Fishery, Agriculture, Mining, and Eco-Tourism. Surigao del Norte is part of
CARAGA that envisions to be the FAME center of the country for the year 2030.
In contribution to the goal of the said region, the researchers come up with the
idea of creating an application that will help potential investors who wants to put
up a business in Surigao del Norte. With the application providing areas and

particular investments on the products of the area.

The proponents adapt the concept of Geographic Information System and
the idea of Decision Support System that will help the investor to expedite
decision making process by providing visual representation of the map of Surigao
del Norte using Open Street Map as the base map of the system. Together with
the map are the data relevant to Surigao del Norte like population density, hazard

susceptibility of a particular area, road maps, facilities, and networks.

During the testing, the proponents conducted a research using the System
Usability Scale Test that will help to evaluate the efficacy of the system. As a

result, the average percentage is 78.63. According to the score measurements
and industry standards, the system is good and doing okay but could use

improvements.

"ABSTRACT

Evacuation Center Locator using Geographical Information System
(ECLGIS) has been developed to find the nearest evacuation center base on
userâ€™s current location in Butuan City. The user should open the global
positioning system (GPS), on their smartphones and after that it would
automatically determine where they are. It would also give nearest evacuation
center based on user current location. This study focuses only on finding the
nearest evacuation center base on userâ€™s current location. Furthermore,
inquiry was also included in this study to become more interactive wherein
individuals in the community can use the application in terms of any
catastrophe and view all nearest evacuation center. Using System
Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as a method in making the application was
very useful and helpful in identifying errors during the development. The
following technologies like Android Studio and ARCGIS are used in making
the application. The proponents conducted a survey for the application quality
of the system to places that has a high risk of imminent threat like flood prone
area and was highly acceptable based on the total mean obtained of 4.70.
The application was indeed useful to the residents of Butuan City who live in
the flood prone area because it helps them find the nearest evacuation center
base on userâ€™s current location before the situation get worst. This eliminates
the manual way of telling the people in Butuan City to evacuate on that certain
school or covered court by barangay officer going to their houses. it was
relevant and important as per needs for safety and welfare of the community.

"ABSTRACT

Agusan River Flood Monitoring using Raspberry Pi with SMS Advisory
has been developed to give warning and to help the residents of the affected
barangays because Butuan City was prone to flooding during rainy season.
This study focuses only on the water level detection and early warning system
(via SMS) that alerts affected residents for a potential flood event and give the
address of the nearest evacuation center in their area. Furthermore, inquiry
was also included in this study to become more interactive wherein individuals
in the community could inquire the actual water level status and the residents
can also turn on and off the SMS notification alert through SMS keyword.
Using System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as a method in making the
software was very useful and helpful in identifying errors during the
development. The following technologies like Raspberry Pi 3 B+, Ultrasonic
Sensor, and GSM are used in making the prototype. The proponent
conducted a survey for the software quality of the system to the affected
barangay and was highly acceptable based on the total mean obtained of
4.52. The software was indeed useful to the residents who live in the flood
prone area because it helps them evacuate early before the situation get
worst. This eliminates the manual way of detecting the water level of the flood
and late receiving of SMS waming of the residents. it was relevant and
important as per needs for safety and welfare of the community.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Aimed to develop a key dispenser with face recognition using Raspberry
pi. It employed developmental research method. There were thirty (30)

respondents utilized to evaluate the developed system. The respondents were
given questionnaire to provide information intended for evaluating the
developed system. The questionnaire was patterned after the international
standard organization (ISO) 1926-1 software quality standard the mean was
used for computation in determining the systemâ€™s functionality, reliability,
accuracy, and security. The developed system provides a modernized and
efficient system for distributing keys. It was developed using iterative waterfall
development model techniques that employed top-down approach as a
strategic method to the system development. The following were performed,
namely: data gathering procedures, requirement analysis, designing, coding,
testing and evaluation, and implementation. The system was found highly
functional, reliable, highly accurate, and highly secure with the total mean
obtained 4.21, 4.12,4.24, 4.39 respectively. The software quality of the system
developed a Key Dispenser with Face Recognition using Raspberry pi was

"ABSTRACT

The proposed ACLC Departmental Scheduling System was created
and designed to supply the needs of the client. The researchers gathered all
the data in order to develop a system which created schedules for the users
freed from hassle going to school just to look for their exam schedules.
Further saying this system is useful for the scheduler and also for the students
to determine their respected schedules. For the instructors, with their busy
schedules, they can save time looking for their exam schedule that they are

going to proctor.

The researchers aim to create an electronic system for departmental
examinations in ACLC Departmental Examination Scheduling System (ADES)
ACLC Butuan while the scheduler stands as an admin and the one who
creates the entire schedule for the departmental examination. The HR can
only view the schedule and indicate the time for the proctors. The instructor

and student can only view their schedule through the mobile app.

The researcher successfully created the system which really helps not

just for the students but also for the scheduler to view their exam schedules.

The researchers, therefore, concluded based on the testing phase that
on the student's side, they fount out that the application is appropriate and
accessible to the students. On the other hand, teachers or instructors also
appreciated the function of the application, especially the viewing of the exam

"ABSTRACT

This study is about the Solar Powered Automated Drying Rack Using
Raspberry Pi. The study is focused on developing a drying rack prototype that
would automatically hide and unhide due to rain instances. The researchers
anchored the study in Home Automation Systems Theory, thus, the study
provided two interfaces that would enable the users to automatically and
manually control the prototype. The study was conducted for the purpose of
finding a solution to the inconvenience that the raining probability gives
whenever clothes are hanged onto the drying rack in an open area. There is a
possibility that it might get wet if there is an unpredicted rain. Or, simply, no one
is around to take care of the clothes when it rains. The proponenis of the study
aimed to develop a solar powered drying rack prototype that would
automatically and manually hide and unhide due to rainfall detection and
weather forecast from the internet. The newly developed system must be
evaluated in terms of functionality, reliability, efficiency and usability. By utilizing
the Waterfall Development Model Methodology, the prototype was improved,
developed and implemented into a hardware product that would benefit people
of different walks of life in a community who are too occupied to monitor their
clothes in the drying rack. In addition, it can be an efficient solution to the
inconvenience since the prototype is solar powered, hence, weather monitoring
and controlling of the drying rack can be carried out at any time of the day
without worrying about power interruption. The prototype used relevant
technologies such as Raspberry Pi 3, Rain Sensor Module and Servo Motor for
rainfall detection and mechanical control of the drying rack. In addition, the
prototype integrated mobile application to remotely control the drying rack. The
study has reached its purpose in developing a solar powered automated drying
rack prototype using raspberry pi. The researchers concluded that the
developed system is acceptable in accordance to the ISO/IEC 9126-1 Quality
Standard Model.

ABSTRACT

Tracer study is an approach which is globally used in most organization
especially in the educational institutions to track and to keep a record of
students once graduated from the institution. This study aims to develop a
Decision Support System (DSS) tool that will analyze the systematic tracing of
graduates and make decisions based on the outcome of the forecast. Decision
Support System (DSS) is an information system that supports business or
organizational decision-making activities. This serves the management,
operations and planning levels of an organization and help people make
decisions about problems that may be rapidly changing and not easily specified
in advance. The proponents used Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average
(ARIMA) a time-series analysis model to forecast the future number of
graduates in the upcoming year as well as the graduateâ€™s productivity and
competitiveness, also the number of employed and unemployed graduates. To
improve decision making and analyzing of data; to generate statistical results a
decision support system tool must be develop. The proponents conducted a
survey to test the developed systemâ€™s efficiency to the graduates as the
respondents and was acceptable based on the obtained 3.95 mean average.
With that, the proponents developed a decision support system that would give
assistance to the institution on the decision-making and planning preparation
regarding on how to improve the curricular programs of BS in Information
Technology, BS in Computer Science, BS in Business Administration major in

Financial Management, BS in Business Administration major in Marketing
Management, Computer-Based Accounting and Associate in Computer

"ABSTRACT

The proposed ACLC Departmental Scheduling System was created
and designed to supply the needs of the client. The researchers gathered all
the data in order to develop a system which created schedules for the users
freed from hassle going to school just to look for their exam schedules.
Further saying this system is useful for the scheduler and also for the students
to determine their respected schedules. For the instructors, with their busy

schedules, they can save time looking for their exam schedule that they are

going to proctor.

The researchers aim to create an electronic system for departmental
examinations in ACLC Departmental Examination Scheduling System (ADES)
ACLC Butuan while the scheduler stands as an admin and the one who
creates the entire schedule for the departmental examination. The HR can
only view the schedule and indicate the time for the proctors. The instructor

and student can only view their schedule through the mobile app.

The researcher successfully created the system which really helps not

just for the students but also for the scheduler to view their exam schedules.

The researchers, therefore, concluded based on the testing phase that
on the studentâ€™s side, they fount out that the application is appropriate and
accessible to the students. On the other hand, teachers or instructors also

appreciated the function of the application, especially the viewing of the exam

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Many clinics are still using paper usage to record all the information and
medical records of a patient and manual system in other clinical activities. The
purpose of this study is to address the concern and solve related problerns by
developing a Polyclinic Management System which aims to support the clinic's
daily activities. This system involves all the clinic activities starting fromm
registration to billing. The system is able to generate all clinic transactions such
as reports, doctor's prescription, patient's information and medical history,
medicine inventory, consultations and billings. It also has queuing and
appointment system for patients to save their time, effort, and resources.

The methods used for this study include Feature Driven Developrnent
(FDD) and Agile Approach which is applied while developing this system. The
design involves Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and Data Flow Diagram
(DFD) to show the logical flow for the system. For the implementation, Apache
is used as a web server, MySQL as a database, PHP Laravel as a scripting
language and Google Chrome as a browser.

Furthermore, the doctor, secretary and patients will give their evaluation
and also opinions to make the system more usable for the clinicâ€™s daily activity.
Overall, this system is able to support the daily clinic operation based on

"ABSTRACT

This study is about Measuring the Level of Ammonia Gas in a Comfort Room
with Flushing Mechanism Activation and Notification Features using
Raspberry Pi. The study was conducted with the purpose of maintaining the
sanitary condition of the comfort room and eliminating foul smell of urine, to
save water, energy and to minimize the work of the utility workers. The
researchers of the study developed a prototype that can detect if the level of
ammonia gas in the comfort room is high and will automatically flush the toilet
bowl, send a notification to the cleaners that the comfort room is in need of
cleaning; the exhaust fan will tum on automatically for 5 minutes only and will
automatically turn off. The air freshener will automatically turn on after the
exhaust fan is off and it will spray for at least 3 minutes. The newly developed
system must be evaluated in terms of functionality, reliability, efficiency and
usability. By using the Waterfall Development Model Methodology, the
prototype was developed and implemented into a hardware output that would
benefit different establishments and its utility workers. The prototype used
technologies such as Raspberry Pi 3, MQ137 Ammonia Gas Sensor, Exhaust
Fan, Air Freshener and Servo Motor for mechanical control of the toilet bowl's
flush. In addition, the prototype integrated mobile application for receiving
notification via internet. The study had reached its purpose and main
objectives. The researchers concluded that the developed system was

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The study is Expert System for Dish Recommendation. This is about
getting the knowledge of a dish expert or a chef and convert it into logical
machine program on how the dish expert or a chef decides after they answer
series of questions and the same thought on how the application generates dish
recipes after the user answered series of questions. This is all about cloning the

decision and translating the rules into terms that a machine can understand.

The proponents proposed to develop the Expert System for Dish

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Real estate registration systems are systems or software that keep
track of real properties available for sale. Using these systems, one can view
information on real estate properties without the need to visit the actual sites.
It also provides system administrators means to keep records of the
transactions involved in the sale of real properties.

GIS is a computer system for storing, displaying, checking related data
about the position on earth surface. GIS can show data in one map to help
people analyze and compare and differentiate the relationship of things in the
earthâ€™s terrain. It also includes locations such as farms, housing and other
relevant establishments.

The Real Estate Registration System with GIS will provide potential
buyers a means to search desired locations at a glance. This is made
possible by utilizing accurate GlS-based maps and up-to-date data from the
local Land Registration Authority. It also lifts the burden from the land sellers
in advertising their properties and alleviates the hassle in real estate sales
processing. With the help of the GlS-based property finder, viewers can use
smartphones or tablets with browsers to easily access the site. The system

also track the available property for sale and it can locate exact location of the

property instead of visiting personally.

The Real Estate Registration System with GIS will help to locate the
exact location of property particularly in Butuan City. The system is the

response to the problem faced in some real estate management companies

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This research entitled, â€œKnow Caraga: An Android Game Applicationâ€ is
a promotional tool for the entire Caraga region. The core concept of the
application is to let the player choose between the three(3) categories namely,
â€œKnow Me Moreâ€ which tackles about the history or information of each
province, the second one is â€œTrulseâ€™, it is named after the combination of a
type of quiz â€œTrue or Falseâ€™, this category focuses on the artifacts that have
been found on the land, also it gives us the calendar of events that is
celebrated in each places, and the last one is the â€œCaragaâ€™s bestâ€™, it shows

the beauty of the tourist spots offered by the nature of Caraga.

After gaining up knowledge from the lessons, the game will proceed to
a different type of quizzes which depends on what category they've chosen.
For the category Know Caraga, you can play a fill in the blank, for the Trulse,
it is true or false, and for the Caragaâ€™s best it is a multiple-choice type of quiz.
Each quiz completed, the player will be given points that can be redeemable

"ABSTRACT

This study is about the Solar Powered Automated Drying Rack Using

Raspberry Pi. The study is focused on developing a drying rack prototype that
would automatically hide and unhide due to rain instances. The researchers
anchored the study in Home Automation Systems Theory, thus, the study
provided two interfaces that would enable the users to automatically and
manually control the prototype. The study was conducted for the purpose of
finding a solution to the inconvenience that the raining probability gives
whenever clothes are hanged onto the drying rack in an open area. There is a
possibility that it might get wet if there is an unpredicted rain. Or, simply, no one
is around to take care of the clothes when it rains. The proponents of the study
aimed to develop a solar powered drying rack prototype that would
automatically and manually hide and unhide due to rainfall detection and
weather forecast from the internet. The newly developed system must be
evaluated in terms of functionality, reliability, efficiency and usability. By utilizing
the Waterfall Development Model Methodology, the prototype was improved,
developed and implemented into a hardware product that would benefit people
of different walks of life in a community who are too occupied to monitor their
clothes in the drying rack. In addition, it can be an efficient solution to the
inconvenience since the prototype is solar powered, hence, weather monitoring
and controlling of the drying rack can be carried out at any time of the day
without worrying about power interruption. The prototype used relevant
technologies such as Raspberry Pi 3, Rain Sensor Module and Servo Motor for
rainfall detection and mechanical control of the drying rack. In addition, the
prototype integrated mobile application to remotely control the drying rack. The
study has reached its purpose in developing a solar powered automated drying
rack prototype using raspberry pi. The researchers concluded that the

"ABSTRACT

The Internet of Things (loT) has caught the attention of the big sectors
of the society in the fields of business, industry, and academy. Technically,
the Internet of Things (loT) is responsible for technologically enhancing day to
day activities, the creation of various products and services in business, and
as an inclusive source of research ideas and topics. Due to ever-growing
populations, the number of vehicles in a city also increases resulting in the
rise of the number of road accidents discovered. The Butuan City Police
Station 1 had a tally of 177 motorcycle accidents from 2016 to the month of
April of this year, 62 or 35% of these are reportedly alcohol-related. More than
9% of motorcycle accidents per year in Butuan City is alcohol-related. By this
reason, the proponents conducted the study entitled Mitigating Vulnerabilities
through Alcohol Detector with Engine Ignition Stopper (ADWEIS) for
Motorcycles. The objective of the study is to develop a device that will be
embedded to the motorcycle and helmet. The proponents decided to develop
a prototype to mimic the functionalities of a motorcycle, an important function
of the prototype is to detect alcohol level, this is made possible by the help of
the MQ3 Alcohol sensor. After blowing to the device for the five-second
countdown, the device will then process if the breath contains alcohol gas. If
the sensor detects 0.08% of blood alcohol content, the device will initiate a
buzzer notification and will cause a stoppage to the ignition of the engine.
Another module is the helmet that will send an SMS notification to the
indicated number if alcohol presence is detected. The proponents decided to
use the Rapid Application Development model which involves fast phase
development with iterative processes. The proponents also used Survey
Questionnaire as a tool for data gathering. The proponents provided 20
questionnaires in relation to the ISO-9126-1 Software Quality Characteristics
to determine overall quality of the prototype. The survey resulted with a mean
of 4.6 on the overall quality stating that the prototype is Acceptable.

"ABSTRACT

Ground shaking is one of the effects of an earthquake. This describes
the vibration of the ground during an earthquake which is an unpredictable
phenomenon. The Philippines is vulnerable to calamities because it is part of
the pacific ring of fire and most of our resources for calamity preparation are
not much on earthquake events. The shaking and moving of the ground from
earthquakes are not predictable, but it can be measured. Seismic activity, which
is the shaking of the ground, is measured by seismographs. The proposed work
is to design a system that can detect ground shaking and provide a dynamic
safety mechanism for building infrastructures. The system will estimate the local
seismic intensity of the ground shaking at the particular location of the
instrument. To determine the magnitude of the shaking the researchers used
the ADXL335 three-axis accelerometer. This sensor can measure the static
acceleration of gravity in tilt-sensing applications, as well as dynamic
acceleration resulting from motion, shock, or vibration and use Arduino UNO as
its main controller. It is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-
use hardware and software and applies the 3-dimensional vector formula to get
the seismograph reading of the shaking. It also applies the Richter scale
formula to calculate the approximate magnitude. The system provides an alarm
signal and safety mechanisms to a building like automatically opening doors
and activating guiding lights. Those dynamic safety mechanisms will trigger the
approximated threshold. Optimistically, the system should help to reduce the
number of injuries and casualties due to its capabilities during a ground-shaking

situation.

"ABSTRACT

; Bill to Coin Exchanger with Notification and Security Features using
Convolutional Neural Network which makes changing bills to coin more modern
and advance. This innovation helps the people for the easy flow of transactions
when it comes to changing coins. It uses Convolutional Neural Network and
Image Processing to determine that the bill is being inserted is authentic or
counterfeit. The machine shows a User Interface which user can choose his/her
coin denomination. The proponents used the System Development Life Cycle
(SDLC) method Iterative Waterfall Model a sequential design process for the
deployment of the processes of the machine. This model is appropriate for the
developed a machine since it is a step by step process, because every phase of
the development can be repeated whenever there are changes along the
development. When the survey was released and finished the results were
tabulated and found out that the developed machine garnered positive responses
from the selected respondents of the study. The developed machine was highly
acceptable and efficient to the users based on the total mean of 4.30 gathered
from the ISO-1926-1 Survey Questionnaire. The proponents concluded that with
the use of Bill to Coin Exchanger with Security and Notification Features using
Convolutional Neural Network and Image Processing would make the
transaction changing bills to coin more efficient, reliable and advance compared
to the current manual processing of transaction.

"ABSTRACT

anine Capture System with GPS for capturing stray

s on isolated or prone areas where a stray dogs usually spotted in the city
using GPS to locate and identify status of the cage. The system has two
primary functions, one is to capture the stray dog with a strong cage and
second is to notify the admin with a photo captured inside the cage when the
trap is activated and then receive a SMS message of the status of the cage
with location. Once a stray dog activated the trap the door will closed by
f the cage. A photo will be send

releasing the servo motor that holds the door o
to the admin website using a camera located above the cage after the trap is

activated. The admin then receives a SMS message about the status and
location of the cage using a fixed GPS location.

ABSTRACT

The study Nurse Assistant Robot: The aim of this study is to aid in the battle
against the spread of Covid-19, a new human coronavirus, in hospitals, public
transportation, airplanes, and other enclosed spaces. In this research, we used
this prototype as an agent to minimize the risk of physical contact. Since our
findings show that a mobile robot is the most successful device for inactivating
microorganisms, we created the Nurse Assistant Robot. The robot is equipped
with one ultra-sonic sensor for detecting any object that trigger and activate the
disinfectant alcohol with the specific distance. Camera to allow the nurse in
charge of the robot to see the direction as it has four wheels for mobility.
Microphone, in order for the patient to communicate with the nurse. Within the
range of the Wi-Fi link, the robot can be operated.

"ABSTRACT

The study aimed to develop a system for monitoring fishpond with
notification component. It employed developmental research method. There were
thirty (30) respondents utilized to evaluate the developed system. The
respondents were given questionnaire was patterned after the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO 9126-1) software quality standard. Mean
was used for computation in determining the systemâ€™s functionality, reliability,
usability, efficiency, and security. The developed system provides a modernized
and efficient system for monitoring the fishpond with reporting components. It
was developed using the iterative waterfall model technique that employed
iterative as a strategic approach to the system development. The following were
performed, namely, data gathering procedures, requirements analysis, designing,
coding, testing and evaluation, and implementation. The system was found highly
functional, highly reliable, highly efficient, and highly usable. The software quality
of the developed system â€œA System for Monitoring Fishpond with Notification
Componentâ€ was acceptable to the users based on the total mean obtained of
4.44. It is therefore recommended that the system be adopted by fisherfolks.

"ABSTRACT

A Microcontroller Based System for Object Disinfection and Sanitation
using Object Detection Technology has been developed scan the item with the
help of camera. The system detects automatically detect the item and
categories as food, non-food, fresh food. The System had a conveyor that
would help the system to allocate item in the proper disinfection and sanitation
section. It used variety type of disinfection and sanitation tools and materials
such as Ultraviolet light, Ultrasonic Mist Maker Humidifier and Sanitizer Spray
alcohol 99% solution. Disinfect and sanitized are the possibility of inactivating
viral, bacterial, and fungal aerosols in a chamber-type air disinfection system
by using an Ultraviolet light array treatment effectively inactivated viral
infectivity, the highest ultraviolet susceptibility, represented by the inactivation
rate constant, was calculated for bacteria, followed by fungi and viruses. The
following technologies like Raspberry Pi, Arduino Uno, Ultraviolet light,
Conveyor, Pi Camera, water sensor, Buzzer, Wiper DC Motor, Humidifier and
Relay are used in making the prototype. The researcher used the survey
questionnaire tool to examine the concept and capabilities for the prototype
according to the ISO-9126-1 software quality characteristics was highly
acceptable based on the total mean obtained of 4.7. The prototype was indeed
useful to the people because it helps them to sanitize the food, non-food and

"ABSTRACT

changing money fon cant pie f ial an news mare
ill to coin more straightforward, more
modern, and advanced. This machine is convenient to people because of its
easy-to-understand flow of transactions regarding changing money from one
form to another. It uses the universal coin acceptor to accept and validate the
inserted coins and the bill acceptor for the inserted bills. The user will choose
what type of transaction he wants, changing coins to cash or cash to coins.
They will also decide the denomination that they wish to have. The
proponents used the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) method
Waterfall model, a sequential design process for developing the prototype.
This SDLC model is appropriate for developing the machine by the
proponents since it is a step by step process. The proponents must finish
each process first before moving on to the next one. After the proponents
released and completed their survey, the results were gathered and tabulated.
The proponents found out that the developed prototype garnered positive
responses from the selected respondents of the study. The prototype
gathered a total mean of 4.38 from the ISO-1926-1 Survey Questionnaire,
which means that it was highly acceptable to the users selected by the
survey. The proponents concluded that the use of Mikay: An Automated
Money Changer would make the transaction changing bills to coin and coin to
cash more efficient, more convenient, reliable, and advanced compared to the

current manual processing of transactions.

"ABSTRACT

Q-Gen: A Web-Based Comprehensive Test Creator for All Field of Study
with Item Analysis Feature has been developed to provide teachers another
way to conduct their exams through making use of technology and allowing
them to no longer be troubled with checking the countless tests passed by their
students as the system will check it in their place instead. Other than that, the
system will also be able to display the Item Analysis for said Test and offer
Teachers the ability to reuse tests made by other teachers through inserting a
Test Bank feature for approved questionnaires. In order to provide an accurate
analysis for each item on the Test, the system will be fully capable of
computing both the Discrimination Index(D.!) and Difficulty Value(D.V) in order
for the teacher to properly evaluate how good a quality of a question is. The
D.V is one of the most useful and most frequently reported item analysis
statistics. It is a measure of the proportion of examinees who answered the
item correctly w. The D.| is a measure of how well an item is able to distinguish
between examinees who are knowledgeable and those who are not, or
between masters and non-masters.

"ABSTRACT

DrPedia: A Facebook Messenger Chatbot to Cater Pediatric Concern
Using Expert System with Embedment of Deep Learning Algorithm has been
developed to help people who are in need, especially the young parents in
their pediatric concerns. This study focused on catering ten common pediatric
illnesses in which the system conversed with the users concerns through
Facebook Messenger and provided natural home remedies and precautionary
measures. Furthermore, symptom checker was also included in this study for
reliability in catering the pediatric concerns of the users wherein the users
gave the symptoms that they are currently experiencing and the system did
the rest. Using Iterative Waterfall Model as a method in developing the system
was very useful and helpful in identifying errors during the development and
testing phase. Technologies such as Heroku, MongdoDB, GitHub, and
Facebook API were used in order to develop the system. The proponents
conducted a survey to the users and experts to identify the quality of the
system. From the results, it was highly acceptable based on the total mean
obtained of 4.41. The system was indeed useful for the users who have
concerns with regards to the health of their children. This gave more
convenient way for the user's lack of knowledge in handling their pediatric
concerns to be catered. The system was relevant and important in this
technological era that prompts to the idea of helping people who are in need.

"ABSTRACT

The Internet of Things (loT) has caught the attention of the big sectors
of the society in the fields of business, industry, and academy. Technically,
the Internet of Things (loT) is responsible for technologically enhancing day to
day activities, the creation of various products and services in business, and
as an inclusive source of research ideas and topics. Due to ever-growing
populations, the number of vehicles in a city also increases resulting in the
rise of the number of road accidents discovered. The Butuan City Police
Station 1 had a tally of 177 motorcycle accidents from 2016 to the month of
April of this year, 62 or 35% of these are reportedly alcohol-related. More than
9% of motorcycle accidents per year in Butuan City is alcohol-related. By this
reason, the proponents conducted the study entitled Mitigating Vulnerabilities
through Alcohol Detector with Engine Ignition Stopper (ADWEIS) for
Motorcycles. The objective of the study is to develop a device that will be
embedded to the motorcycle and helmet. The proponents decided to develop
a prototype to mimic the functionalities of a motorcycle, an important function
of the prototype is to detect alcohol level, this is made possible by the help of
the MQ3 Alcohol sensor. After blowing to the device for the five-second
countdown, the device will then process if the breath contains alcohol gas. If
the sensor detects 0.08% of blood alcohol content, the device will initiate a
buzzer notification and will cause a stoppage to the ignition of the engine.

Another module is the helmet that will send an SMS notification to the
indicated number if alcohol presence is detected. The proponents decided to
use the Rapid Application Development model which involves fast phase
development with iterative processes. The proponents also used Survey
- Questionnaire as a tool for data gathering. The proponents provided 20

- questionnaires in relation to the ISO-9126-1 Software Quality Characteristics
to determine overall quality of the prototype. The survey resulted with a mean
of 4.6 on the overall quality stating that the prototype is Acceptable.

"ABSTRACT

Wearable Blood Pressure Monitoring System Using Arduino In Generating

Status Report Through Web Portal Access is a web with wearable device that

monitor the status of the user and also track the location. This innovation

helps the people who's having a hypertension and cannot monitor daily.

Through developing a web-based application to monitor the status and

coordinates with time and date. With the help of the device the user can

monitor their self using the web or mobile phone. Their relatives can track the
current location of the user. The proponents use the System Development
Life Cycle(SDLC) method Iterative Waterfall Model a sequential design
process for deployment of the processes of the system. The Waterfall Model
is appropriate for developing the system since it is a step by step process that
cannot proceed to the next step unless the proponents finish the step then go
back to the previous step to make sure it is properly done. The proponents
conducted a survey and tabulate the result and found out that the developed
system has positive result based on the selected respondents of the study.
The findings of the study is the developed system was evaluated as
functional, reliable, efficient and usable. The developed system has
acceptable and efficient to the user based on the total mean of 3.95 through
gathering from the ISO-1926. The proponents conclude that by the use of
wearable blood pressure monitoring system using arduino in generating
status report through web portal access is reliable and efficient.

"ABSTRACT

One of the major problems that is occurring to the world, is the rapid
increase of distribution of heat due to climate change. In the current events,
multiple reports of devastation due to heat problems that occur may it be
natural forest fire, melting of ice and other natural damages. One of the most
concem is the effects of heat to a person when exposed to high temperature.
The developers came up with an idea to create a hardware that will detect
heat and temperature in an area in which they added a feature that will send
notifications to saved recipients when the heat increased to an extent that it
may inflict health damages to a person, the researchers conducted a study on
the heat instances in the Philippines as reported by PAGASA and created a
hardware device to compute heat waves. Using heat and humidity sensors

installed to Raspberry Pi, the researchers were able to compute heat real
time. Using the software Twilio, the researchers were able to send text
messages real time containing information about the current heat situation
and help tips on how to hydrate and keep themselves safe from health

damages it may inflict.

Therefore, the researchers were able to hit their objectives and were able to
build a hardware that is equipped with the exact sensors to produce the
desired results and required output. With this the researchers were able to
formulate reliable results to be distributed to the public.

"ABSTRACT

Evacuee Monitoring System with Facial Recognition, Fingerprint Scanner and
Message Notification Service using Open CV was developed to address the
current manual process of monitoring the evacuees during evacuation. The
study focused in monitoring the evacuees during their stay in the evacuation
center. This included their signed in records and also when they received the
relief goods intended for them. This system was created not only to automate
the current manual process but also to address the issue of the staff regarding
the evacuees claiming more relief goods that what was intended for them.
Furthermore, a rescuers mobile app was also developed so that they will be
able to notify those residents who were not yet in the evacuation center to
evacuate. Using the Rapid Application Development as a method in making the
system was useful in identifying the errors during the development period.
Raspberry Pi 3 B, fingerprint scanner and Pi Camera were the main
components for the hardware prototype. Based on the survey conducted, the
total mean obtained is 3.98 with a descriptive rating functional. The developed
system was indeed useful to the evacuees, staffs and rescuers. This eliminated
the manual registering and monitoring of the evacuees in the evacuation
center.

"ABSTRACT

Covid-19 is a pandemic disease that
erupted and exploded at the end
: eeu Start of 2020. Centered on the WHO's declaration (World Health
rganization), the virus has now spread to more than 20 nations and

territories around the world. The Covid19 virus spreads mainly by saliva
droplets or nose discharge.

Studies have been conducted for monitoring local residence accessing
establishments as an aid for contact tracing and data analytics; these studies
are to control the spreading of Covid-19 or known as ""CoronaVirus disease.""
Also, this study focused on the QR code that is used to access people
entering the establishments. The proponent used Model Agile planning,
designing, planning, construction, testing, and implementation. In designing
the System, the advocates used the Agile Approach to comply with the system
specifications. If the first step is finished, the promoter can not proceed to the
next step, but he will move backward from the previous step if there will be
any adjustments.

In this approach, QR codes are issued by Barangay officials' in local
areas. The code does not retrieve the users' location data; instead, it has
three colors, black, red, and blue, that represent which scheduled people are
allowed to enter the establishments. Each code has a unique ID to identify if
the person is authorized to enter an establishment. This approach can serve

available for both an Android device and a computer. The system uses the
Iterative Waterfall Model as useful method in creating the course, and it helps
identify errors during the development and testing phase. The proponents use
Python, Firebase, Bootstrap, Google Maps API, and several other software
packages to develop the system. The proponents also surveyed the different
users to identify the systemâ€™s quality, and the man result obtained was 3.96
which is considered reliable, usable and efficient. E-HATUD: Web Online
Ordering and Delivering System with GPS Tracking for Independent Merchant

"ABSTRACT

Wireless sensor network applications in the agriculture sector are
gaining popularity with the advancement of the Internet of Thing technology.
Predominantly, wireless sensor networks are used in agriculture to sense the
important agriculture field parameters, such as temperature, humidity, soil
moisture level, salinity level, and so on. Technically, the Internet of Thing (loT)
is responsible for technologically enhancing day to day activities. Rice
production in the Philippines is an important aspect of the countryâ€™s food
supply and economy. The Philippines is the 8'"" largest rice production in the
world, accounting for 2.8% of global rice production. By this reason, the
proponents conducted the study entitled Rice field automation system
embedding moisture and salinity detection with notification and irrigation
control facility. The proponent decided to develop a prototype to mimic the
functionalities of irrigation, an important function of the prototype is to detect
moisture and salinity level. The system can trigger the water pump whether it
is automatic or manual, in manual procedure the farmer can on and off the
water pump without the condition of TDS sensor and off in a certain time and
in automatic parts, the irrigation will trigger if he didnâ€™t detect any moisture in
the soil for a certain time with the help of web application. The system also
sends information daily through SMS notification to update the farmer.

"ABSTRACT

Deaf people have difficulty in communicating with others who don't
understand signing. HandTalk: A Mechanical and Sensing Device for Hand
Gesture to Text Translation as an Aid for â€œHearing Impaired Personâ€ has been
developed to assist the non-verbal people to speak. This study involves a
glove with flex sensors that output a text that varies with the degree of bend
made by the fingers. Flex sensors are sensors that change in resistance
counting on the quantity of bend on the sensor. The text will display on LCD
upon bending. The proponents conducted a survey from verbal individuals for
the testing of the prototype, and was acceptable supported the entire mean
obtained of 4.158. The prototype was indeed useful for a hearing impaired
person. During this project, the hardware that used are Arduino, LCD display

"ABSTRACT

A Centralized Garbage Status Monitor with Automated Intelligent Features has
developed to help people that need especially in our Cities, Barangay and also our trash
collector who needs to inform as early as can do to monitor there MRF so that is can

a. prevent and always clean their MRF. This project uses Iterative Waterfall Model as a

method in developing the system, it was a very useful and helpful in identifying errors
during the development and testing phase. This project concerned the human health of
our society is because the gases of our trash cause disease in our health, with the help
of this project it can prevent the gases that surrounded our MRF so that it canâ€™t affect to
our trash collector and also maintain the cleanliness of our MRF. The project was relevant
important in this technological era that prompts the idea of helping people are in need.
This project has some features also it has an intelligent program that manipulate all the
sensors to prevent and be monitored by the staff of that specific barangay. The project
could give more satisfying result or output that could help them improve the cleanliness
of our MRF. This project could detect the Hydrogen Sulfide on the trash and it could give
more signals to all the sensors on the prototype to notify them in that specific MRF that
has a bad odor, and that time the trash collector will take that so that the odor couldnâ€™t
spread the gases in the surroundings. This project could give time management for the
trash collector and prevent odor gases that caused disease to our health.

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The proposed Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) File Tracking System
was designed and developed according to the needs of the institution. The
researchers gathered all the requirements and information in order to develop

the proposed system.

The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) File Tracking consists of sub
systems namely the Document Management System, Monitoring and Billing
System, Record keeping, Information System, and Android Based Mobile
Smart Tracking System. These sub systems are designed for viewing the
filesâ€™ movement. Also, the proposed system can track the papersâ€™ movements

by using android application designed for viewing the filesâ€™ movement.

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The research in speech recognition has been intensively carried out
worldwide, spurred on by advances in signal processing, algorithms, architectures,
and hardware. Speech and text recognition systems have been developed for a wide
variety of applications, ranging from small vocabulary keyword recognition over dial-
up telephone lines, to medium size vocabulary voice interactive command and control
systems on personal computers, to large vocabulary speech dictation, spontaneous
speech understanding, and limited-domain speech translation. In this chapter we
review some of the key advances in several areas of speech and text recognition. We
also briefly discuss the requirements in designing successful real-world applications
and address technical challenges that need to be faced in order to reach the ultimate

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The province of Surigao del Norte is rich in natural resources where many
investors are interested in investing when it comes to the leading industries of
Fishery, Agriculture, Mining, and Eco-Tourism. Surigao del Norte is part of
CARAGA that envisions to be the FAME center of the country for the year 2030.
In contribution to the goal of the said region, the researchers come up with the
idea of creating an application that will help potential investors who wants to put
up a business in Surigao del Norte. With the application providing areas and

particular investments on the products of the area.

The proponents adapt the concept of Geographic Information System and
the idea of Decision Support System that will help the investor to expedite
decision making process by providing visual representation of the map of Surigao
del Norte using Open Street Map as the base map of the system. Together with
the map are the data relevant to Surigao del Norte like population density, hazard

susceptibility of a particular area, road maps, facilities, and networks.

During the testing, the proponents conducted a research using the System
Usability Scale Test that will help to evaluate the efficacy of the system. As a

result, the average percentage is 78.63. According to the score measurements

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Grand Palace Chinese Restaurant is one of the iconic food
destinations in Butuan City. The business started in September
2011, with its building structure formed similar to a Chinese
temple with mixed modern innovation. With the mission to ensure
that each guest receives prompt, professional, friendly and
courteous service.

The essence of this system is to create a web-based
payroll system with daily time record to cater the security needs of
both the employees and the human resource in precision of time
logs records, payslip information and accessibility of information.

Grand Palace uses the manual tallying of log records and
manual calculation of salary for the employees. The system is
used to make records and to avoid impartial salary and time
recordsâ€”an honest record without any other possible inaccuracy

and to have full meticulous results of transactions.

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Technology nowadays is growing fast and it affects the developing
organizationâ€™s success. The evolution of technology plays an important role in
developing this system. ACLC Butuan is one of the growing institutions. The
finance department of ACLC still using the old Assessment and Cashiering
System with an error occurs. The proponents proposed to create new system

which still in-line with the process of the old system to replace the old system

and eliminate those errors and boost the service of the institution to their clients.

Assessment and Cashiering System with Online Queuing is a system
mainly for Accounting and Cashier Staff and Queue Administrator. The ACLC
especially in the finance department is still using the old system which the user
cannot add or save raw fees of the students in the system, there is no system
user management where the administrators can add or update users and
provide a privilege to access the system of a certain user also the system is
developed using the VB6 platform; there are compatibility issues between the
Said platform and new operating systems and errors there are errors found and

the queuing system is limited only for three stations. As this problem found by
the proponents, we come up to a decision in developing the ACB Educational
Assessment and Cashiering System with Online Queuing which develop using
PHP platform to provide a new system and eliminate those errors found. This

system has user management which staff can add or update user, also it can
d stations and

arrow fos of students and he

"ABSTRACT

Agusan River Flood Monitoring using Raspberry Pi with SMS Advisory

has been developed to give warning and to help the residents of the affected
barangays because Butuan City was prone to flooding during rainy season.
This study focuses only on the water level detection and early warning system
(via SMS) that alerts affected residents for a potential flood event and give the
address of the nearest evacuation center in their area. Furthermore, inquiry
was also included in this study to become more interactive wherein individuals
in the community could inquire the actual water level status and the residents
can also turn on and off the SMS notification alert through SMS keyword.
Using System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as a method in making the
software was very useful and helpful in identifying errors during the
development. The following technologies like Raspberry Pi 3 B+, Ultrasonic
Sensor, and GSM are used in making the prototype. The proponent
conducted a survey for the software quality of the system to the affected
barangay and was highly acceptable based on the total mean obtained of
4.52. The software was indeed useful to the residents who live in the flood
prone area because it helps them evacuate early before the situation get
worst. This eliminates the manual way of detecting the water level of the flood

"ABSTRACT

GreenBot is an automated indoor greenhouse management system for
microgreen plants that allows the user to manage, monitor and be notified of its
growth and status from planting until harvesting. The purpose of this research
is to develop an accurate, portable but automated indoor greenhouse for
microgreen plants using cheaper materials in order to help the user manage
their microgreens even if they are not around or without direct user intervention.
The programing languages used for GreenBot are Python for server-side
processes and for modules in controlling hardware, JavaScript for user
interface functionalities, HTML and CSS for user-interface design. GreenBot
uses Twillio SMS platform for sending SMS notification. The system uses
pythonanywhere.com for the webhosting of systems online interface. The
Hardware modules used by the system are DHT11 sensor module which is
used for taking the temperature and humidity, Soil moisture sensor and analog
to digital module which is used for measuring water level and soil moisture level,
LED lights for lighting. Brushless DC exhaust fan for ventilation, camera for
taking up pictures, water pump for watering plants and Raspberry Pi which is
the main component of the system that contains the system files, scripts and
assets used by GreenBot. The materials and interface used by the system
helps the user to grown their microgreen plant even if theyâ€™re not around
because of the automation of lighting, ventilation and watering of the plants.
The user also stays on track by SMS notification sent by the GreenBot about
the status of the machine like temperature, humidity and the water container
level. User can also see their plants remotely by visiting the systems online
page and by clicking take picture button to see the plants. Greenbot is really
helpful especially for people who are home growing microgreens themselves

ABSTRACT

Bookista - An Electronic Library System with Augmented Reality is a web
and mobile application which makes your library experience more modern and
advance. This innovation helps the student and librarian for the easy flow of
transactions inside the library. It promotes Augmented Reality through the use
of your android mobile device. The application lets you scan the QR code of
every book then it offers not only the eBook version but also other related

books, online references and the details of the book. This web and mobile
based application is a modern innovation for the library experience of every
user. The proponents used the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) method
Iterative Waterfall Model a sequential design process for the deployment of the
processes of the system. This model is appropriate for the developed system
since it is a step by step process, because every phase of the development can
be repeated whenever there are changes along the development. When the
survey was released and finished the results were tabulated and found out that
the developed software garnered positive responses from the selected
respondents of the study. The developed system was highly acceptable and
efficient to the users based on the total mean of 4.70 gathered from the ISO-
4926-1 Survey Questionnaire. The proponents concluded that with the use of
Bookista: An Electronic Library System with Augmented Reality in the library

"ABSTRACT

The prototype GrabBage: A Hand Gesture Controlled Garbage Picking
Bot provides an innovative solution to environmental issues mainly to the
garbage problem. It aims to minimize the amount of trash that ends up in the
landfills and oceans wherein the prototype integrates the capabilities of human
hand gestures for environmental protection by developing a Hand Gesture
Controlled Garbage Picking Bot. The proponents also take action to the
previous study about the level of information and education campaign on solid
waste management and household practices on solid waste disposal in Butuan
City. The overall conclusion to the study states that the level of IEC in both rural
and urban barangays of Butuan City is poor. The data provides evidence that
methods such as public forum or general assembly, focus group discussion,
installation of tarpaulin and other signs, television ad and radio broadcast,
house to house information campaign, and school campaign were seldom
carried out and one of the recommendations set is the need to create new
structures, and undertake innovative plans that are more responsive to the
needs of the communities. By the proponentsâ€™ idea, it establishes mechanisms
through the prototype to improve awareness and broad dissemination of
relevant information on efficient disposal of garbage. In summary, this
innovation has been prepared with the motivation of being useful to
entrepreneurial projects based on robotics technology used in environmental
protection. The prototype serves as a starting point in terms of providing

"Abstract

Vehicular Locking System with Real-Time Location Monitoring using
GPS and Arduino has been developed to give locking system and monitoring
system and to help the vehicular owners in Butuan City because of the fast-
growing populating of vehicle owners. This study focuses on locking,
monitoring and give messaging command (via SMS) that communicate with
the vehicular owner to update the vehicle owners from theft or unwanted
access to the vehicle. Furthermore, an inquiry was also included in this study
to become more interactive wherein individuals in the community could
inquire the actual vehicle status and the owners can also turn on and off the
SMS notification alert through SMS keyword. The vehicle can be monitored
through the web application. Using the System Development Life Cycle
(SDLC) as a method in making the software was very useful and helpful in
identifying errors during the development. The following technologies like
Arduino Uno, GSM and Buzzer are used in making the prototype. The
proponents conducted a survey for the software quality of the system to the
vehicular owners and was highly acceptable based on the total mean
obtained of 4.1956. The prototype was indeed useful to the vehicular owners
because it helps them to monitor the vehicle in the situation if someone else's
in the family used it. This eliminates the manual way of locating the vehicle
real-time and late receiving of SMS warning of the vehicular owners. It was
relevant and important as per the needs for safety and welfare of the

"ABSTRACT

A Web Portal Application for Accessing Micro Credit Records has been
developed to help lenders to view borrowers credit records especially their
previous credit from other lending company or institution. And to have
decision making for basis through credit scores as a measure of a persons
creditworthiness to identify if the borrowers are good payer or not. This study
focuses on lending company and other institution so they can easily view their
borrowers credit records with the credit score. The proponents used the
method of FICO (Fair Isaac Corporation) Credit scoring model as basis in
obtaining the credit score of the borrowers. The proponents conducted a
survey to test the developed system efficiency to the lenders as respondents
and was acceptable based on the obtained 4.07 mean average. With that, the
proponent developed a system for lenders to view their borrowers previous
credit records from other company and make decision through credit score of

"ABSTRACT

The study is about A Geotagging and Detection System of Smokers Using
Deep Learning using Raspberry Pi 4. The study focuses on developing a
hardware device that detects smokers from the undesignated area, the
hardware device also navigates and verifies the location of the smokers. The
researchersâ€™ conducted this study for the reason that this may be one of the
solutions to the inconvenience of a secondhand smoker. Thereâ€™s a possibility
though that the percentage rate of object detection is not accurate for instance
like dark areas. The researchersâ€™ goal is to provide a hardware device that
detects people who don't abide by the smoking ban law. The hardware device
provides also navigation to the smokersâ€™ position. This hardware device entitles
A Geotagging and Detection System of Smokers Using Deep Learning must
evaluate in terms of functionality, reliability, efficiency, usability. By using the
Prototype Approach Model Methodology, the prototype developed was
improved and it can benefit the secondhand smoker from breathing the smoke
of cigarettes. Also, the hardware device is automated hardware device that can
roam around within range. This would be an efficient solution to the authorities
that is too occupied to other work. The prototype used relevant technologies
such as Raspberry Pi 4 as microcontroller, Object detection module, and Global
Positioning System for the detection of smoker and location of smoker. The
study has reached its purpose in developing A Geotagging and Detection

System of Smokers Using Deep Learning using raspberry pi.

"ABSTRACT

This study is about Fensec: An automated fence intruder detection using
Self -organizing Map. The study focuses in developing system that would
automatically notifies the owner or the personnel in-charge if there is an intruder
detected over the fence by sending an alarm to the web application and also
sending SMS notification to the owner of the building and house. The study was
conducted for the purpose of finding an alternative solution for the problem of
having a rampant house break-in nowadays. There is a possibility that the
security cannot attain and monitor the premise 24/7 in which the owner cannot
look up to their houses. The researchers aimed to develop an automated fence
intruder detection that would automatically detect fence intruder in the business
buildings and houses who have fences in their properties. The new developed
system must be evaluated in terms of functionality, reliability, efficiency and
usability. By developing the system, the water fall development model was used
in order not proceed to the next development phase if the first phase is not yet
finished. The system and prototype were improved and implemented into an
imbedded system to benefit people who has fences to their homes and
business buildings. In addition, it can be an efficient solution to the risk of every
buildings and houses because of its features that can automatically detect a
fence intruder during day and night. The study has reached to its purpose in
developing an automated fence intruder detection in a real time capturing of
intruder. During the survey for the system quality, the system came up with the
average of 3.84 which means the system is acceptable. The researchers
conclude that the developed system is acceptable in accordance to the ISO/IEC

"ABSTRACT

Mobile learning is an exciting and important movement. In our ever-
changing marketplace, today pre-school students are being educated. Largely
for jobs that has not yet been invented. The problem is that not all pre-school
students can identify objects easily. Based on the survey, teachers are
frequently used as a manual lecture, hence, the proponents decided to
develop an application for them to automatically identify and can help to the
pre-school students through this application. The proponents decided to use

the top-down approach which was essential in breaking down the modules of
e-Tudlo: A Mobile Learning Tool for Pre-School in Object Identification to gain
insight this application. The goal of this study was to provide an application
which can help or support to the pre-school students of Butuan City by means
of detecting objects immediately. The proponents gathered all the data
needed to develop an application from the pre-school students of Butuan City.
The data collected has been studied and analysed by the proponents to
determine the objectives in line with the project goals. These data serve as
the reference to design and modify the application that will be created. The
user can interact with the application through the camera. When the camera
facing to the objects, it will display information of the data and automatically
speak it out. Users require password when they want to exit the application.
The e-Tudlo: A Mobile Learning Tool for Pre-School in Object Identification
has met the objectives of the study.

"ABSTRACT

a An implementation of Vehicle to Vehicle Communication for Automobile
Collision Avoidance using Ad-hoc Network has been developed to provide an
optimal solution on vehicle collisions. This study focuses only on helping people
to avoid vehicle accidents that leads to both minor and major injuries and worse
is death. Using the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as a method in
developing the prototype it enhances the development to make the evaluation
of each module easier â€” it also, act as a guide of the proponents. The
proponents used an offline system named Ad-hoc network in the prototype in
sending and receiving the predefined messages that includes information of the
vehicle such as plate number, speed and geographic location. The following
electronic components and technologies were utilized in developing the vehicle
to vehicle communication: Raspberry Pi 3 B+ as the microcontroller, LCD (16 x
2 12C), Piezo Speaker, Buttons, Breadboard, Jumper Wires, NEO6M GPS
Module and MCP3008. The proponents carefully analyzed all the necessary
data gathered from the internet and conducted a survey to assess the quality
of the system â€” to a fifty (50) respondents composed of eighteen (18) car
owners, ten (10) car renter and twenty-two (law enforcers). The assessment
accumulated 4.13 total mean, equivalent to highly acceptable. The device is
indeed an ideal solution to help the prevention of vehicle collisions â€” enables
the drivers to communicate and transmit information towards the other vehicle.

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The proponents have decided to develop an android phone
security application that could help mitigate the increasing number of missing
phones. The descriptive method of research was used in this study. Surveys
and interviews were conducted in order to know their experiences in losing their
smartphones. The developed application is basically a mobile application which
the user can monitor their phone if their phone is in lost mode with the help of
the features that the developer implemented. One of the objective of this study

is to develop the features in tracing and protecting your android smartphones if
ever it is stolen or gone missing and in longer term will help mitigate phone
missing cases. This will also give benefits to the users because it will somehow
lessen their worries in losing their smartphones. The proponents use a Global
Positioning System (GPS) and Google Map in their application for tracking the
lost phone and monitor it with another devices where it is registered as a backup
phone. The Proponents choose Android Operating System (aOS) in developing
the project for it has a great number people using this mobile operating system
and it is always on demand in every marketplace. The development of this
project is patterned with the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Agile

Approach. The proponents used the agile as a guide to get their goals and to

have an effective and efficient mobile application.

ABSTRACT

The study aimed to develop a system for monitoring fishpond with
notification component. It employed developmental research method, There were

thirty (30) respondents utilized to evaluate the developed system. The
respondents were given questionnaire was patterned after the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO 9126-1) software quality standard. Mean
was used for computation in determining the system's functionality, reliability,
usability, efficiency, and security. The developed system provides a modernized
and efficient system for monitoring the fishpond with reporting components. It
was developed using the iterative waterfall model technique that employed
iterative as a strategic approach to the system development. The following were
performed, namely, data gathering procedures, requirements analysis, designing,
coding, testing and evaluation, and implementation. The system was found highly
functional, highly reliable, highly efficient, and highly usable. The software quality
of the developed system â€œA System for Monitoring Fishpond with Notification
Componentâ€ was acceptable to the users based on the total mean obtained of
4.44. It is therefore recommended that the system be adopted by fisherfolks.

"ABSTRACT

Pedestrian road crossings have become a major issue in road
accidents, especially in urban areas where the issue of control exists. To
improve the mobility between the drivers and the cross walkers, a pedestrian
lane recognition system is necessary. Pedestrian awareness is essential for
improving road safety. Hence, the proponents came up with the idea of
pedestrian recognition system aimed to recognize the presence of pedestrian
lane and automatically performs motion control to stop whenever an obstacle
or a person crossing is detected. The purpose of this report is to provide an
overview of research studies on pedestrian safety. Raspberry Pi camera
module using the method of color thresholding is used for image processing
and classifying image as pedestrian lane or not. This identifies two-
dimensional images using RGB color model that will recognize the color
preferred by the user in the camera recognition and ultrasonic sensor. The
proponents made an analysis of the peculiarities of the task of surveillance for
pedestrian crossings and presented a pedestrian recognition system. A
thorough investigation was performed on a test image in order to validate the
system's effectiveness. The efficiency of the system is affected by real-time
processing and the error rate of recognition. In general, the system helps the
people and the drivers to cross pedestrian lane in a well-organized and more

secure way.

"ABSTRACT

PayAppBus- A Cashless Payment Transaction Application for Bus
Commuters using Mobile Load Balance through Location-Based Dynamic
Fare Computation is a mobile application that makes bus commuters, bus
conductors and admin more advance. This Innovation helps the bus
commuters pay fare using mobile load balance with the help of QR code for
security purposes. It promotes PayAppBus through the use of your android
mobile device. The application lets you scan the QR code being provided by
the selected bus then wait for the next process to be conducted by the
conductor which will conduct all the information given by the bus passenger.
This mobile based application is created to modernized the flow of fare
etiquette of every bus commuter. This will help not just the bus passengers
but also the conductors and admin in making their work more secure and
fast. The developed application is highly acceptable and efficient to users.
The researchers conclude that with the use of PayAppBus- A Cashless
Payment Transaction Application for Bus Commuters using Mobile Load
Balance through Location-Based Dynamic Fare Computation would make
the transaction more efficient inside the bus station, reliable and advanced
compared to the current manual processing of fare transaction.

"ABSTRACT

An Implementation of TESDA Competency Based Training Delivery
Transaction Management System has been prepared by the proponents to
help TESDA Provincial Office on monitoring their trainers and trainee to
ensure that their trainers are doing their job accordingly. The study focused on
monitoring the trainers and trainees by means of using charts and notifying
the Provincial Office when a sudden activity has been done by the trainers
and trainees such as answering the Pre-test and Post-test. Furthermore,
automatic changes have been implemented into its charts and also if given a
change this is the first system to be used and implemented on TESDA for
monitoring their trainers and trainees. During the development the proponents

used System Development Life Cycle (SDLC), this method was very useful on

identifying errors. The proponents used python and flask to connect on the
webpage with the side server data which is MySQL database. Python flask is
easy to call the template from the website which passed through the host and
URL to ensure the software quality, the proponents conducted a survey result
and got the result of 4.225. The result proves that the software is indeed
useful and helpful on monitoring TESDA Provincial office trainers and
trainees. Also using this system eliminates manual way of monitoring their
trainees and trainers and can rest assured that their trainers are doing their
job accordingly. The system also helps to all trainers to do work paperless
and send the data automatically to generate record of a certain trainees.

"ABSTRACT

This study is about Measuring the Level of Ammonia Gas in a Comfort Room
with Flushing Mechanism Activation and Notification Features using
Raspberry Pi. The study was conducted with the purpose of maintaining the
sanitary condition of the comfort room and eliminating foul smell of urine, to
save water, energy and to minimize the work of the utility workers. The
researchers of the study developed a prototype that can detect if the level of
ammonia gas in the comfort room is high and will automatically flush the toilet
bowl, send a notification to the cleaners that the comfort room is in need of
cleaning; the exhaust fan will turn on automatically for 5 minutes only and will
automatically turn off. The air freshener will automatically turn on after the
exhaust fan is off and it will spray for at least 3 minutes. The newly developed
system must be evaluated in terms of functionality, reliability, efficiency and
usability. By using the Waterfall Development Model Methodology, the
prototype was developed and implemented into a hardware output that would
benefit different establishments and its utility workers. The prototype used
technologies such as Raspberry Pi 3, MQ137 Ammonia Gas Sensor, Exhaust
Fan, Air Freshener and Servo Motor for mechanical control of the toilet bowlâ€™s
flush. In addition, the prototype integrated mobile application for receiving
notification via internet. The study had reached its purpose and main
objectives. The researchers concluded that the developed system was
acceptable in accordance to the ISO/IEC Software Quality Test.

"Abstract

Vehicular Locking System with Real-Time Location Monitoring using
GPS and Arduino has been developed to give locking system and monitoring
system and to help the vehicular owners in Butuan City because of the fast-
growing populating of vehicle owners. This study focuses on locking,
monitoring and give messaging command (via SMS) that communicate with
the vehicular owner to update the vehicle owners from theft or unwanted
access to the vehicle. Furthermore, an inquiry was also included in this study
to become more interactive wherein individuals in the community could
inquire the actual vehicle status and the owners can also turn on and off the
SMS notification alert through SMS keyword. The vehicle can be monitored
through the web application. Using the System Development Life Cycle
(SDLC) as a method in making the software was very useful and helpful in
identifying errors during the development. The following technologies like
Arduino Uno, GSM and Buzzer are used in making the prototype. The
proponents conducted a survey for the software quality of the system to the
vehicular owners and was highly acceptable based on the total mean
obtained of 4.1956. The prototype was indeed useful to the vehicular owners
because it helps them to monitor the vehicle in the situation if someone elseâ€™s
in the family used it. This eliminates the manual way of locating the vehicle
real-time and late receiving of SMS warning of the vehicular owners. It was
relevant and important as per the needs for safety and welfare of the

community.

"ABSTRACT

DrPedia: A Facebook Messenger Chatbot to Cater Pediatric Concern
Using Expert System with Embedment of Deep Learning Algorithm has been
developed to help people who are in need, especially the young parents in
their pediatric concerns. This study focused on catering ten common pediatric
illnesses in which the system conversed with the users concerns through
Facebook Messenger and provided natural home remedies and precautionary
measures. Furthermore, symptom checker was also included in this study for
reliability in catering the pediatric concerns of the users wherein the users
gave the symptoms that they are currently experiencing and the system did
the rest. Using Iterative Waterfall Model as a method in developing the system
was very useful and helpful in identifying errors during the development and
testing phase. Technologies such as Heroku, MongdoDB, GitHub, and
Facebook API were used in order to develop the system. The proponents
conducted a survey to the users and experts to identify the quality of the
system. From the results, it was highly acceptable based on the total mean
obtained of 4.41. The system was indeed useful for the users who have
concerns with regards to the health of their children. This gave more
convenient way for the userâ€™s lack of knowledge in handling their pediatric
concerns to be catered. The system was relevant and important in this
technological era that prompts to the idea of helping people who are in need.

"ABSTRACT

The study aimed to develop a system for monitor
notification component. It employed develonmental reaaaren raied tees wera
thirty (30) respondents utilized to evaluate the developed system. The
respondents were given questionnaire was patterned after the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO 9126-1) software quality standard. Mean
was used for computation in determining the system's functionality, reliability
usability, efficiency, and security. The developed system provides a modernized
and efficient system for monitoring the fishpond with reporting components. It

was developed using the iterative waterfall model technique that employed
iterative as a strategic approach to the system development. The following were
performed, namely, data gathering procedures, requirements analysis, designing,
coding, testing and evaluation, and implementation. The system was found highly
functional, highly reliable, highly efficient, and highly usable. The software quality
of the developed system â€œA System for Monitoring Fishpond with Notification
Componentâ€ was acceptable to the users based on the total mean obtained of
4.44. It is therefore recommended that the system be adopted by fisherfolks.

"ABSTRACT

uee Monitoring System with Facial Recognition, Fingerprint Scanner and
aannege Notification Service using Open CV was developed to oppo ag
current manual process of monitoring the evacuees during evacuation.
study focused in monitoring the evacuees during their sta
center. This included their signed in recor
relief goods intended for them. This system was created not only to automate
the current manual process but also to address the issue of the staff regarding
the evacuees Claiming more relief goods that what was intended for them.
Furthermore, a rescuers mobile app was also developed so that they will be
able to notify those residents who were not yet in the evacuation center to
evacuate. Using the Rapid Application Development as a method in making the
system was useful in identifying the errors during the development period.
Raspberry Pi 3 B, fingerprint scanner and Pi Camera were the main
components for the hardware prototype. Based on the survey conducted, the
total mean obtained is 3.98 with a descriptive rating functional. The developed
system was indeed useful to the evacuees, staffs and rescuers. This eliminated
the manual registering and monitoring of the evacuees in the evacuation
center.

ABSTRACT

Bill to Coin Exchanger with Notification and Security Features using

Convolutional Neural Network which makes changing bills to coin more modern
and advance. This innovation helps the people for the easy flow of transactions
when it comes to changing coins. It uses Convolutional Neural Network and
Image Processing to determine that the bill is being inserted is authentic or
counterfeit. The machine shows a User Interface which user can choose his/her
coin denomination. The proponents used the System Development Life Cycle
(SDLC) method Iterative Waterfall Model a sequential design process for the
deployment of the processes of the machine. This model is appropriate for the
developed a machine since it is a step by step process, because every phase of
the development can be repeated whenever there are changes along the
development. When the survey was released and finished the results were
tabulated and found out that the developed machine garnered positive responses
from the selected respondents of the study. The developed machine was highly
acceptable and efficient to the users based on the total mean of 4.30 gathered
from the ISO-1926-1 Survey Questionnaire. The proponents concluded that with
the use of Bill to Coin Exchanger with Security and Notification Features using
Convolutional Neural Network and Image Processing would make the
transaction changing bills to coin more efficient, reliable and advance compared
to the current manual processing of transaction.

Keywords: Convolutional Neural Network, image processing, bill acceptor, bill

"ABSTRACT

The Intemet of Things (loT) has caught the attention of the big sectors
of the society in the fields of business, industry, and academy. Technically,
the Internet of Things (loT) is responsible for technologically enhancing day to
day activities, the creation of various products and services in business, and
as an inclusive source of research ideas and topics. Due to ever-growing
populations, the number of vehicles in a city also increases resulting in the
rise of the number of road accidents discovered. The Butuan City Police
Station 1 had a tally of 177 motorcycle accidents from 2016 to the month of
April of this year, 62 or 35% of these are reportedly alcohol-related. More than
9% of motorcycle accidents per year in Butuan City is alcohol-related. By this
reason, the proponents conducted the study entitled Mitigating Vulnerabilities
through Alcohol Detector with Engine Ignition Stopper (ADWEIS) for
Motorcycles. The objective of the study is to develop a device that will be

embedded to the motorcycle and helmet. The proponents decided to develop

a prototype to mimic the functionalities of a motorcycle, an important function

of the prototype is to detect alcohol level, this is made possible by the help of
the MQ3 Alcohol sensor. After blowing to the device for the five-second

countdown, the device will then process if the breath contains alcohol gas. If
the sensor detects 0.08% of blood alcohol content, the device will initiate a
buzzer notification and will cause a stoppage to the ignition of the engine.
Another module is the helmet that will send an SMS notification to the
indicated number if alcohol presence is detected. The proponents decided to
use the Rapid Application Development model which involves fast phase
development with iterative processes. The proponents also used Survey
Questionnaire as a tool for data gathering. The proponents provided 20
questionnaires in relation to the ISO-9126-1 Software Quality Characteristics
to determine overall quality of the prototype. The survey resulted with a mean
of 4.6 on the overall quality stating that the prototype is Acceptable.

"ABSTRACT

The study aimed to develop an automated pig feeding with depth
analysis using computer vision. The study was conducted to illustrate the
piggery business and how it process. There were Thirty (30) respondents used
to test the system and gathered information in Slaughter House Butuan City
and Buenavista Agusan del Norte. The study aimed to develop a piggery in
terms of automatic feeding and water refilling and also to determine the sizes
of the pigs. In terms of software development the system will notify the owner if
the water tank and food storage is empty. The questionnaire was patterned
after the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) software quality
standard. Mean was used for computation in determining the functionality,
efficiency, usability and reliability. It was developed using the waterfall model
as a developmental approach. The following were performed namely; planning,
requirements gathering, analysis, design, development, testing, debugging and
deployment. The developed project was found functional, reliable, and efficient
on the total mean of 4.16, 4.08, 4.16 and 4.1 respectively. The software quality
of the developed system an automated pig feeding with depth analysis using
computer vision was highly acceptable to the users based on the total mean
obtained of 4.0. It is therefore recommended that the system be adopted by the

"ABSTRACT

Water Level and Wind Intensity Identification using Microcontroller with
Message Notification Service for Alarm and Waming System has been
developed to give waming and to help the residents of the affected puroks
because Butuan City was prone to flooding and wind storm during rainy and
windy seasons. This study focuses only on the water level detection and wind
intensity and early waming system (via SMS) that alerts affected residents for
a potential flood and wind event and give status through to the facebook
notifications. Furthermore, inquiry was also included in this study to become
more interactive wherein individuals in the community could inquire the actual

water level status and wind status where residents can also turn on and off the
SMS notification alert through SMS keyword. Using System Development Life
Cycle (SDLC) as a method in making the hardware was very useful and helpful
in identifying errors during the development. The following technologies like
Arduino Uno, Ultrasonic Sensor, Anemometer, Sim900 GSM and Network
Booster are used in making the prototype. The proponents conducted a survey
for the hardware quality of the system to the affected puroks and was highly
acceptable based on the total mean obtained of 4.52. The software was indeed
useful to the residents who live in the flood prone area because it helps them
evacuate early before the situation get worst. This eliminates the manual way
of detecting the water level of the flood and wind intensity of the wind storm and
late receiving of SMS warming of the residents. It was relevant and important as
per needs for safety and welfare of the community. The keywords are â€œwater
levelâ€™, â€œwind statusâ€ and â€œall statusâ€.

"ABSTRACT

Wearable Blood Pressure Monitoring System Using Arduino i
Status Report Through Web Portal Access is a web with wearable ovis the
monitor the status of the user and also track the location. This innovation
helps the people who's having a hypertension and cannot monitor daily.
Through developing a web-based application to monitor the status and
coordinates with time and date. With the help of the device the user can
monitor their self using the web or mobile phone. Their relatives can track the
current location of the user. The proponents use the System Development
Life Cycle(SDLC) method Iterative Waterfall Model a sequential design
process for deployment of the processes of the system. The Waterfall Model
is appropriate for developing the system since it is a step by step process that
cannot proceed to the next step unless the proponents finish the step then go
back to the previous step to make sure it is properly done. The proponents
conducted a survey and tabulate the result and found out that the developed
system has positive result based on the selected respondents of the study.
The findings of the study is the developed system was evaluated as
functional, reliable, efficient and usable. The developed system has
acceptable and efficient to the user based on the total mean of 3.95 through
gathering from the ISO-1926. The proponents conclude that by the use of
wearable blood pressure monitoring system using arduino in generating
status report through web portal access is reliable and efficient.

Keywords: Web-based application, track the location, SDLC method Iterative

"Abstract

Driving Detection with Vehicular Motion Control
to reduce the number of vehicular accidents due to
using four-wheeled

Optimized palate
ism is develope

Oe Ving This study focuses on drivers who are -
vehicles travelling almost everywhere accessible. The use of four-wheele
vehicles have been increased since its first manufacture and because of this,
accidents caused by drunk-driving using these vehicles have also been rising.
In order to accomplish the main objective, the prototype detects both the
drowsiness and the alcohol intoxication of the driver using the driverâ€™s breath.
it will calculate the measurement of the eye every time itâ€™s closed or opened
with the use of the Eye Aspect Ratio to verify if the driver is drowsy or not. At
the same time, it will have the sensor to measure the alcohol content in the
drivers breath. The following technologies that are used in making the
prototype are following: Raspberry Pi 3 as the microcontroller, MQ-3 Alcohol
Sensor Module as utilized to detect alcohol in breath, Raspberry Pi Camera
used for stream and eye detection. With the use of the System Development
Life Cycle (SDLC) specifically the Iterative Waterfall Model the proponents
were able to track errors throughout the development process. Resulting from
the total mean obtained of 4.50 from the survey conducted means that the
proponents find the prototype beneficial to them. In conclusion, this study will
be helpful to the community to lessen road accidents caused by drunk-driving.

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The proposed Butuan City Boarding House Locator was designed and
developed according to the information the proponents have gathered. The
researchers gathered all the requirements and information in order to develop

the proposed system.

The Butuan City Boarding House Locator consists of 3 different web
portals the search portal, owner portal and admin portal, The search portal
allows the search user to search for a boarding house according to the search
user conditions. The owner portal allows all registered boarding house owner
in the system to update his/her boarding house availability and vacancy. If the
vacant number reaches 0 the system automatically update the availability to
full and if the vacancy number is equal to 1 or more not exceeding the total
number of boarders the system will automatically update the availability to
available. The admin portal allows the admin to register boarding house
owner and their boarding house to the system. The admin will give accounts
to the registered owner so they can use the system in updating their boarding

house information.

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Traffic Congestion Detection with Alternative Path Recommendation is
designed mainly to aid the private drivers in avoiding traffic with the use of its features

in providing real time traffic status and altemative path.

Through study, the researchers determined a number of existing applications
that have the same features and are already used by private drivers. Therefore,
researchers used the traditional transport and vehicular systems that used a V2V
communication, in which data are reliant to the users. Thus, the researchers provided
a feature that is not available to any existing application such as using a CCTV to
provide a real time traffic status and an alternative path. With these features, the
researchers believed that it could really be a good help to private drivers in order to

easily check the traffic status of a specific road, avoid traffic, and shift to routes with

less traffic congestion.

To end, the researchers therefore concluded that the Traffic Congestion
Detection with Alternative Path Recommendation was able to achieve the objectives

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The province of Surigao del Norte is rich in natural resources where many
investors are interested in investing when it comes to the leading industries of
Fishery, Agriculture, Mining, and Eco-Tourism. Surigao del Norte is part of
CARAGA that envisions to be the FAME center of the country for the year 2030.
In contribution to the goal of the said region, the researchers come up with the
idea of creating an application that will help potential investors who wants to put
up a business in Surigao del Norte. With the application providing areas and

particular investments on the products of the area.

The proponents adapt the concept of Geographic Information System and
the idea of Decision Support System that will help the investor to expedite
decision making process by providing visual representation of the map of Surigao
del Norte using Open Street Map as the base map of the system. Together with
the map are the data relevant to Surigao del Norte like population density, hazard

susceptibility of a particular area, road maps, facilities, and networks.

During the testing, the proponents conducted a research using the System
Usability Scale Test that will help to evaluate the efficacy of the system. As a

result, the average percentage is 78.63. According to the score measurements

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Real estate registration systems are systems or software that keep track of
real properties available for sale. Using these systems, one can view information on
real estate properties without the need to visit the actual sites. It also provides
system administrators means to keep records of the transactions involved in the sale

of real properties.

GIS is a computer system for storing, displaying, checking related data about
the position on earth surface. GIS can show data in one map to help people analyze
and compare and differentiate the relationship of things in the earthâ€™s terrain. It also
includes locations such as farms, housing and other relevant establishments.

The Real Estate Registration System with GIS will provide potential buyers a
means to search desired locations at a glance. This is made possible by utilizing
accurate GlS-based maps and up-to-date data from the local Land Registration
Authority. It also lifts the burden from the land sellers in advertising their properties
and alleviates the hassle in real estate sales processing. With the help of the GIS-
based property finder, viewers can use smartphones or tablets with browsers to

easily access the site. The system also track the available property for sale and it

can locate exact location of the property instead of visiting personally.

The Real Estate Registration System with GIS will help to locate the exact
location of property particularly in Butuan City. The system is the response to the
problem faced in some real estate management companies without Geographic

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Food Shop Locator in Butuan City using Mapping Application is
designed to give an advance and useful application for people to easily find
food shops that are near and affordable for the family and love ones. Also it
provides features that are necessary for an effective way of having a Food

Shop Locator using Mapping Application.

Through this study, the researchers are well aware that there are
plenty of existing application that have the same features and are already
used by other people. Hence, the researchers provided features that are not
available in other existing application such as finding the nearest restaurant
that is affordable for the userâ€™s budget and also having to choose what food
they like. With these features, the researchers believed that it could be a
benefit help for the users in order for them to have an easy access in finding

food shops.

To this end, the researchers conclude that the Food Shop Locator in
Butuan City using Mapping Application was achieved and it can be used for

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The proponents come up with a mobile application idea that will assist people

on their demands on services in the context of technical expertise. The descriptive
method of research was used in this study. Surveys and interviews Were conducted in
order to identify the common services needed by people, access of these services and
people who can provide the service. The project is basically a mobile application in
which a client can access and request for services to service provider. One of the
objectives of this study is to give suggestion of service provider with high credibility
to address the needs of the clients, and at the same time to locate service providers.
This will also give benefits to the service provider, because it will somehow
propagate the extent of its operation to a wider market. The proponents use a Global
Positioning System (GPS) and Google Map for tracking of both client and service
providerâ€™s location within Butuan City. The proponents choose android O.S. in
developing the project for its numerous users and demand on the market. The
development of this project is patterned with the System Development Life Cycle
(SDLC) Agile Approach. The proponents used the agile as a guide to get their goals
and to have an effective and efficient system. Theories and concepts of CSS, HTML,

PHP, internet, Google Map, computer programming, and various software and

hardware platforms are deemed necessary for the making of the project.

ABSTRACT

Tracer study is an approach which is globally used in most organization
especially in the educational institutions to track and to keep a record of
students once graduated from the institutionâ€™ This Study aims to develop a
Decision Support System (DSS) tool that will analyze the systematic tracing of
graduates and make decisions based on the outcome of the forecast. Decision
Support System (DSS) is an information system that supports business or
organizational decision-making activities. This serves the management,
operations and planning levels of an organization and help people make
decisions about problems that may be rapidly changing and not easily specified
in advance. The proponents used Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average
(ARIMA) a time-series analysis model to forecast the future number of
graduates in the upcoming year as well as the graduateâ€™s productivity and
competitiveness, also the number of employed and unemployed graduates. To
improve decision making and analyzing of data; to generate statistical results a
decision support system tool must be develop. The proponents conducted a
Survey to test the developed systemâ€™s efficiency to the graduates as the
respondents and was acceptable based on the obtained 3.95 mean average.
With that, the proponents developed a decision support system that would give
assistance to the institution on the decision-making and planning preparation
regarding on how to improve the curricular programs of BS in Information
Technology, BS in Computer Science, BS in Business Administration major in
Financial Management, BS in Business Administration major in Marketing
Management, Computer-Based Accounting and Associate in Computer

"ABSTRACT

Evacuation Center Locator using Geographical Information System
(ECLGIS) has been developed to find the nearest evacuation center base on
userâ€™s current location in Butuan City. The user should open nice global
positioning system (GPS), on their smartphones and after that it nie
automatically determine where they are. It would also give nearest evacuation
center based on user current location. This study focuses only on finding the
nearest evacuation center base on user's current location. Furthermore,
inquiry was also included in this study to become more interactive wherein
individuals in the community can use the application in terms of any
catastrophe and view all nearest evacuation center. Using System
Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as a method in making the application was
very useful and helpful in identifying errors during the development. The
following technologies like Android Studio and ARCGIS are used in making
the application. The proponents conducted a Survey for the application quality
of the system to places that has a high risk of imminent threat like flood prone
area and was highly acceptable based on the total mean obtained of 4.70.
The application was indeed useful to the residents of Butuan City who live in
the flood prone area because it helps them find the nearest evacuation center
base on user's current location before the situation get worst. This eliminates
the manual way of telling the people in Butuan City to evacuate on that certain

ABSTRACT

GreenBot is an automated indoor greenhouse management system for
microgreen plants that allows the user to manage, monitor and be notified of its
growth and status from planting until harvesting. The purpose of this research
is to develop an accurate, portable but automated indoor greenhouse for
microgreen plants using cheaper materials in order to help the user manage
their microgreens even if they are not around or without direct user intervention.
The programing languages used for GreenBot are Python for server-side
processes and for modules in controlling hardware, JavaScript for user
interface functionalities, HTML and CSS for user-interface design. GreenBot
uses Twillio SMS platform for sending SMS notification. The system uses
pythonanywhere.com for the webhosting of systems online interface. The
Hardware modules used by the system are DHT11 sensor module which is
used for taking the temperature and humidity, Soil moisture sensor and analog
to digital module which is used for measuring water level and soil moisture level,
LED lights for lighting. Brushless DC exhaust fan for ventilation, camera for
taking up pictures, water pump for watering plants and Raspberry Pi which is
the main component of the system that contains the system files, scripts and
assets used by GreenBot. The materials and interface used by the system
helps the user to grown their microgreen plant even if theyâ€™re not around
because of the automation of lighting, ventilation and watering of the plants.
The user also stays on track by SMS notification sent by the GreenBot about
the status of the machine like temperature, humidity and the water container
level. User can also see their plants remotely by visiting the systems online
Page and by clicking take picture button to see the plants. Greenbot is really
helpful especially for people who are home growing microgreens themselves
that doesnâ€™t always have the time to manage it whether itâ€™s for personal
consumption or for business purposes.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Aimed to develop a key dispenser with face recognition using Raspberry
pi. It employed developmental research method. There were thirty (30)
respondents utilized to evaluate the developed system. The respondents were
given questionnaire to provide information intended for evaluating the
developed system. The questionnaire was patterned after the international
Standard organization (ISO) 1926-1 software quality standard the mean was
used for computation in determining the systemâ€™s functionality, reliability,
accuracy, and security. The developed system provides a modernized and
efficient system for distributing keys. It was developed using iterative waterfall
development model techniques that employed top-down approach as a
Strategic method to the system development. The following were performed,
namely: data gathering procedures, requirement analysis, designing, coding,
testing and evaluation, and implementation. The system was found highly
functional, reliable, highly accurate, and highly secure with the total mean
obtained 4.21, 4.12,4.24, 4.39 respectively. The software quality of the system
developed a Key Dispenser with Face Recognition using Raspberry pi was

"ABSTRACT

Evacuation Center Locator using Geographical Information System
(ECLGIS) has been developed to find the nearest evacuation center base on
userâ€™s current location in Butuan City. The user should open the global
positioning system (GPS), on their smartphones and after that it would
automatically determine where they are. It would also give nearest evacuation
center based on user current location. This study focuses only on finding the
nearest evacuation center base on userâ€™s current location. Furthermore,
inquiry was also included in this study to become more interactive wherein
individuals in the community can use the application in terms of any
catastrophe and view all nearest evacuation center. Using System
Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as a method in making the application was
very useful and helpful in identifying errors during the development. The
following technologies like Android Studio and ARCGIS are used in making
the application. The proponents conducted a survey for the application quality
of the system to places that has a high risk of imminent threat like flood prone
area and was highly acceptable based on the total mean obtained of 4.70.
The application was indeed useful to the residents of Butuan City who live in
the flood prone area because it helps them find the nearest evacuation center
base on userâ€™s current location before the situation get worst. This eliminates
the manual way of telling the people in Butuan City to evacuate on that certain

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The proposed Butuan City Boarding House Locator was designed and
developed according to the information the proponents have gathered. The
researchers gathered all the requirements and information in order to develop

the proposed system.

The Butuan City Boarding House Locator consists of 3 different web
portals the search portal, owner portal and admin portal. The search portal
allows the search user to search for a boarding house according to the search
user conditions. The owner portal allows all registered boarding house owner
in the system to update his/her boarding house availability and vacancy. If the
vacant number reaches 0 the system automatically update the availability to
full and if the vacancy number is equal to 1 or more not exceeding the total
number of boarders the system will automatically update the availability to
available. The admin portal allows the admin to register boarding house
owner and their boarding house to the system. The admin will give accounts

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Andis Snackbreak Management System was conceptualized based on
the problems encountered by the management and staff with their Traditional
Processes. The management system covers the major processes mainly:
registration of product, employee profiling, assigning employee, and
assessment of orders. The study aims to turn manual system into a modernized

one. It makes the task easier and eliminates the use of manual processing.

Based on the gathered result, the system is indeed helpful in processing
the transactions. The result was weighted through the usability test scale of the
system and the scoring was based on the mathematical standard of system
usability test scale. The proponents conclude that through the use of the
proposed Management System, the owner, who will become the admin, can
manually add, collect and retrieve products and employee information, and can
also review all transaction logs Also, the cashier can follow up and check the
customer's order and lastly, the employee can monitor and check their pay

income daily and also access their personal information.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

ACLC E-Classroom Management System is designed as a useful tool
to help the ACLC of Butuan for their learning process. It provides some
features that will improve the interaction of instructors and students during or

after class hours.

The proponents are well aware that there plenty of existing systems
that have the same functions and features that are used by other schools. In
that case, the proponents provided a feature that is not available on other
existing systems and that is the data integration of Student Information
System (SIS) and Enrollment System of ACLC so that the system will
automatically generate all the data. With these feature, the proponents
believed that it would help the ACLC of Butuan to improve the deliberation of

each class because the system will immediately assign the class sectioning.

To this end, the proponents therefore concluded that, ACLC E-
classroom Management System was able to achieve all the objectives and it
can be used to help the ACLC of Butuan. Furthermore, the mean result of the

Survey conducted is 90.4 the system is considered as efficient.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The proponents come up with a mobile application idea that will assist people
on their demands on services in the context of technical expertise. The descriptive
method of research was used in this study. Surveys and interviews were conducted in
order to identify the common services needed by people, access of these services and
people who can provide the service. The project is basically a mobile application in
which a client can access and request for services to service provider. One of the
objectives of this study is to give suggestion of service provider with high credibility
to address the needs of the clients, and at the same time to locate service providers.
This will also give benefits to the service provider, because it will somehow
propagate the extent of its operation to a wider market. The proponents use a Global
Positioning System (GPS) and Google Map for tracking of both client and service
providerâ€™s location within Butuan City. The proponents choose android O.S. in
developing the project for its numerous users and demand on the market. The
development of this project is patterned with the System Development Life Cycle
(SDLC) Agile Approach. The proponents used the agile as a guide to get their goals
and to have an effective and efficient system. Theories and concepts of CSS, HTML,
PHP, internet, Google Map, computer programming, and various software and

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The proposed Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) File Tracking System
was designed and developed according to the needs of the institution. The
researchers gathered all the requirements and information in order to develop

the proposed system.

The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) File Tracking consists of sub
systems namely the Document Management System, Monitoring and Billing
System, Record keeping, Information System, and Android Based Mobile
Smart Tracking System. These sub systems are designed for viewing the
filesâ€™ movement. Also, the proposed system can track the papersâ€™ movements

by using android application designed for viewing the filesâ€™ movement.

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

With the use of the Android Studio and OpenCV, the proponents were
able to create an android application that can swap faces through live camera
feed. Thus, the Proponents entitled it as the Android Face Swapping
Application. With the use of smart phones, camera manipulation by adding
photo effects became a trend, and from there, the face-swapping feature had
been born and the Proponents have thought to study it and make their own.

Through this study, the proponents have been aware that camera
manipulation is the building block of the so-called augmented reality which is
now being studied by IT professionals today. The augmented reality has a
tremendous impact to our future because it alters reality real time. For
example, an application that analyzes signboards with foreign words and
translates it to English through a live camera feed. It is an application which
can help numerous of foreign travelers that does not know any other language
than their own. Therefore, by studying the basics of the camera manipulation,
we can improve our understanding of augmented reality and maybe in the
future, the proponents can think of an application that can be beneficial to the

community.

The Android Face Swapping Application has one major feature which
is of course, to swap faces in real time. But since swapping two faces is too
common, the proponents decided to increase the number of faces to be
swapped into a minimum of three faces up to five. The proponents therefore

"ABSTRACT

An Application in Detecting Disease and Pest Infestation in Rice Plant
using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), has been developed to give
solution to the Department of Agriculture Caraga Regional Office by detecting
disease rice plant and pestâ€™s infestation in rice plant using the application. And
also, the Department of Agriculture Caraga Regional Office helps the farmers
aware of the diseases and pests attack their rice field. Furthermore, inquiry was
also included in this study to become more interactive wherein the Department
of Agriculture will help the farmers to determine their rice plant is infested with
pest and what possible disease it has. Using System Development Life Cycle
(SDLC) as a method in making the application was very useful and helpful in
identifying errors during the development. The proponents use an algorithm
which is Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that will process a photo of a rice
plant and it will serve as the detector.

"Wearable Blood Pressure Monitoring System Using Ardui ;
Status Report Through Web Portal Access is a web with wearable deviee they
monitor the status of the user and also track the location. This innovation
helps the people who's having a hypertension and cannot monitor daily
Through developing a web-based application to monitor the status and
coordinates with time and date. With the help of the device the user can
monitor their self using the web or mobile phone. Their relatives can track the
current location of the user. The proponents use the System Development
Life Cycle(SDLC) method Iterative Waterfall Model a sequential design
process for deployment of the processes of the system. The Waterfall Model!
is appropriate for developing the system since it is a step by step process that
cannot proceed to the next step unless the proponents finish the step then go
back to the previous step to make sure it is properly done. The proponents
conducted a survey and tabulate the result and found out that the developed
system has positive result based on the selected respondents of the study.
The findings of the study is the developed system was evaluated as
functional, reliable, efficient and usable. The developed system has
acceptable and efficient to the user based on the total mean of 3.95 through
gathering from the ISO-1926. The proponents conclude that by the use of
wearable blood pressure monitoring system using arduino in generating
status report through web portal access is reliable and efficient.

Keywords: Web-based application, track the location, SDLC method Iterative

"Book Indexing with Regular Expression Pattern Matching using Optical
Character Recognition â€” A web based book indexing system with regular
expression pattern matching and optical character recognition. This innovation
helps the librarian to share the information regarding books. The system lets
you upload the file image of back-of-the-book indexes that will be extracted
with the use of optical character recognition software called Python Tesseract
OCR Engine. This OCR engine will let you extract the text from the file image
and save into the database. This system also has a search feature that has a
pattern matching that matches the books who has a related topics. The
Proponents used the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Agile
Development Method. This model is appropriate for the development of the
system since there can be many changes throughout the development stage
of the system. When the survey was released and finished the results were
tabulated and found out that the developed system received positive
feedbacks from the respondents of the study. The developed system was
highly accepted and efficient to the users based on the total mean of 3.27
gathered from the |ISO-1926-1 Survey Questionnaire. The proponents
conclude that the Book Indexing with Regular Expression Pattern Matching
using Optical Scanner will have a wide variety of knowledge to be spread and
will make the searching for books and related books be more efficient, reliable
and more advanced compared to the current manual procedures.

Keywords: Book Indexing, OCR, Regular Expression, PyTesseract, Back-of-

The study aimed to develop an automated pig feeding with depth
analysis using computer vision. The study was conducted to illustrate the
piggery business and how it process. There were Thirty (30) respondents used
to test the system and gathered information in Slaughter House Butuan City
and Buenavista Agusan del Norte. The study aimed to develop a piggery In
terms of automatic feeding and water refilling and also to determine the sizes
of the pigs. In terms of software development the system will notify the owner if
the water tank and food storage is empty. The questionnaire was patterned
after the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) software quality
standard. Mean was used for computation in determining the functionality,
efficiency, usability and reliability. It was developed using the waterfall model
as a developmental approach. The following were performed namely; planning,
requirements gathering, analysis, design, development, testing, debugging and
deployment. The developed project was found functional, reliable, and efficient
on the total mean of 4.16, 4.08, 4.16 and 4.1 respectively. The software quality
of the developed system an automated pig feeding with depth analysis using
computer vision was highly acceptable to the users based on the total mean
obtained of 4.0. It is therefore recommended that the system be adopted by the

"An Implementation of TESDA Competency Based Training Delivery

Transaction Management System has been prepared by the proponents to
help TESDA Provincial Office on monitoring their trainers and trainee to
ensure that their trainers are doing their job accordingly. The study focused on
monitoring the trainers and trainees by means of using charts and notifying
the Provincial Office when a sudden activity has been done by the trainers
and trainees such as answering the Pre-test and Post-test. Furthermore,
automatic changes have been implemented into its charts and also if given a
change this is the first system to be used and implemented on TESDA for
monitoring their trainers and trainees. During the development the proponents
used System Development Life Cycle (SDLC), this method was very useful on
identifying errors. The proponents used python and flask to connect on the
webpage with the side server data which is MySQL database. Python flask is
easy to call the template from the website which passed through the host and
URL to ensure the software quality, the proponents conducted a survey result
and got the result of 4.225. The result proves that the software is indeed
useful and helpful on monitoring TESDA Provincial office trainers and
trainees. Also using this system eliminates manual way of monitoring their
trainees and trainers and can rest assured that their trainers are doing their
job accordingly. The system also helps to all trainers to do work paperless
and send the data automatically to generate record of a certain trainees.

"ABSTRACT

Pedestrian road crossings have become a major issue in road
accidents, especially in urban areas where the issue of control exists. To
improve the mobility between the drivers and the cross walkers, a pedestrian
lane recognition system is necessary. Pedestrian awareness is essential for
improving road safety. Hence, the proponents came up with the idea of
pedestrian recognition system aimed to recognize the presence of pedestrian
lane and automatically performs motion control to stop whenever an obstacle
or a person crossing is detected. The purpose of this report is to provide an
overview of research studies on pedestrian safety. Raspberry Pi camera
module using the method of color thresholding is used for image processing
and classifying image as pedestrian lane or not. This identifies two-
dimensional images using RGB color model that will recognize the color
preferred by the user in the camera recognition and ultrasonic sensor. The
proponents made an analysis of the peculiarities of the task of surveillance for
pedestrian crossings and presented a pedestrian recognition system. A
thorough investigation was performed on a test image in order to validate the
system's effectiveness. The efficiency of the system is affected by real-time
processing and the error rate of recognition. In general, the system helps the
people and the drivers to cross pedestrian lane in a well-organized and more

secure way.

"ABSTRACT

DrPedia: A Facebook Messenger Chatbot to Cater Pediatric Concern
Using Expert System with Embedment of Deep Learning Algorithm has been
developed to help people who are in need, especially the young parents in
their pediatric concerns. This study focused on catering ten common pediatric
illnesses in which the system conversed with the users concerns through
Facebook Messenger and provided natural home remedies and precautionary
measures. Furthermore, symptom checker was also included in this study for
reliability in catering the pediatric concerns of the users wherein the users
gave the symptoms that they are currently experiencing and the system did
the rest. Using Iterative Waterfall Model as a method in developing the system
was very useful and helpful in identifying errors during the development and
testing phase. Technologies such as Heroku, MongdoDB, GitHub, and
Facebook API were used in order to develop the system. The proponents
conducted a survey to the users and experts to identify the quality of the
system. From the results, it was highly acceptable based on the total mean
obtained of 4.41. The system was indeed useful for the users who have
concerns with regards to the health of their children. This gave more
convenient way for the userâ€™s lack of knowledge in handling their pediatric
concerns to be catered. The system was relevant and important in this
technological era that prompts to the idea of helping people who are in need.

Abstract

Vehicular Locking System with Real-Time Location Monitoring using
GPS and Arduino has been developed to give locking system and monitoring
system and to help the vehicular owners in Butuan City because of the fast-
growing populating of vehicle owners. This study focuses on locking,
monitoring and give messaging command (via SMS) that communicate with
the vehicular owner to update the vehicle owners from theft or unwanted
access to the vehicle. Furthermore, an inquiry was also included in this study
to become more interactive wherein individuals in the community could
inquire the actual vehicle status and the owners can also turn on and off the
SMS notification alert through SMS keyword. The vehicle can be monitored
through the web application. Using the System Development Life Cycle
(SDLC) as a method in making the software was very useful and helpful in
identifying errors during the development. The following technologies like
Arduino Uno, GSM and Buzzer are used in making the prototype. The
proponents conducted a survey for the software quality of the system to the
vehicular owners and was highly acceptable based on the total mean
obtained of 4.1956. The prototype was indeed useful to the vehicular owners
because it helps them to monitor the vehicle in the situation if someone elseâ€™s
in the family used it. This eliminates the manual way of locating the vehicle
real-time and late receiving of SMS warning of the vehicular owners. It was
relevant and important as per the needs for safety and welfare of the

"An implementation of Vehicle to Vehicle Communication for Automobile
Collision Avoidance using Ad-hoc Network has been developed to provide an
optimal solution on vehicle collisions. This study focuses only on helping people
to avoid vehicle accidents that leads to both minor and major injuries and worse
is death. Using the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as a method in
developing the prototype it enhances the development to make the evaluation
of each module easier â€” it also, act as a guide of the proponents. The
proponents used an offline system named Ad-hoc network in the prototype in
sending and receiving the predefined messages that includes information of the
vehicle such as plate number, speed and geographic location. The following
electronic components and technologies were utilized in developing the vehicle
to vehicle communication: Raspberry Pi 3 B+ as the microcontroller, LCD (16 x
2 |2C), Piezo Speaker, Buttons, Breadboard, Jumper Wires, NEO6M GPS
Module and MCP3008. The proponents carefully analyzed all the necessary
data gathered from the internet and conducted a survey to assess the quality
of the system â€” to a fifty (50) respondents composed of eighteen (18) car
owners, ten (10) car renter and twenty-two (law enforcers). The assessment
accumulated 4.13 total mean, equivalent to highly acceptable. The device is
indeed an ideal solution to help the prevention of vehicle collisions â€” enables
the drivers to communicate and transmit information towards the other vehicle.

"Ground shaking is one of the effects of an earthquake. This describes
the vibration of the ground during an earthquake which is an unpredictable
phenomenon. The Philippines is vulnerable to calamities because it Is part of
the pacific ring of fire and most of our resources for calamity preparation are
not much on earthquake events. The shaking and moving of the ground from
earthquakes are not predictable, but it can be measured. Seismic activity, which
is the shaking of the ground, is measured by seismographs. The proposed work
is to design a system that can detect ground shaking and provide a dynamic
safety mechanism for building infrastructures. The system will estimate the local
seismic intensity of the ground shaking at the particular location of the
instrument. To determine the magnitude of the shaking the researchers used
the ADXL335 three-axis accelerometer. This sensor can measure the static
acceleration of gravity in tilt-sensing applications, as well as dynamic
acceleration resulting from motion, shock, or vibration and use Arduino UNO as
its main controller. It is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-
use hardware and software and applies the 3-dimensional vector formula to get
the seismograph reading of the shaking. It also applies the Richter scale
formula to calculate the approximate magnitude. The system provides an alarm
signal and safety mechanisms to a building like automatically opening doors
and activating guiding lights. Those dynamic safety mechanisms will trigger the
approximated threshold. Optimistically, the system should help to reduce the

number of injuries and casualties due to its capabilities during a ground-shaking
situation. ,

"This study is about Fensec: An automated fence intruder detection using
Self -organizing Map. The study focuses in developing system that would
automatically notifies the owner or the personnel in-charge if there is an intruder
detected over the fence by sending an alarm to the web application and also
sending SMS notification to the owner of the building and house. The study was
conducted for the purpose of finding an alternative solution for the problem of
having a rampant house break-in nowadays. There is a possibility that the
security cannot attain and monitor the premise 24/7 in which the owner cannot
look up to their houses. The researchers aimed to develop an automated fence
intruder detection that would automatically detect fence intruder in the business
buildings and houses who have fences in their properties. The new developed
system must be evaluated in terms of functionality, reliability, efficiency and
usability. By developing the system, the water fall development model was used
in order not proceed to the next development phase if the first phase is not yet
finished. The system and prototype were improved and implemented into an
imbedded system to benefit people who has fences to their homes and
business buildings. In addition, it can be an efficient solution to the risk of every
buildings and houses because of its features that can automatically detect a
fence intruder during day and night. The study has reached to its purpose in
developing an automated fence intruder detection in a real time capturing of
intruder. During the survey for the system quality, the system came up with the
average of 3.84 which means the system is acceptable. The researchers
conclude that the developed system is acceptable in accordance to the ISO/IEC

"ABSTRACT

The study aimed to develop a Doctor assistant IOT in health sector with
the use of heartbeat sensor, temperature sensor and _ notification using
Raspberry Pi. The study was conducted to illustrate the doctor assistant and
how it processes. The study aimed to develop a system for monitoring patients
with notification component is to monitor the patientâ€™s heartbeat pulse, blood
sugar, blood pressure, and their body temperature and to notify the doctor for
an abnormal heartbeat, blood pressure, blood sugar and body temperature
behavior of the patientsâ€™. The questionnaire was patterned after the
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) software quality standard.
Mean was used for computation in determining the functionality, efficiency,
usability and reliability. It was developed using the Iterative waterfall model as
a development model. The following were performed namely; requirements,
design, implementation, verification, deployment, and maintenance. The
developed project was found functional, reliable, and efficient on the total mean
of 4.16, 4.08, 4.16 and 4.1 respectively. The software quality of the developed
system an loT in Health Sector that monitors the heartbeat, blood sugar, blood
pressure, and temperature of the patients using microcontroller was highly
acceptable to the users based on the total mean obtained of 4.0. It is therefore
concluded that the developed system is acceptable in accordance with ISO/IEC
9126-1 Quality Standard Model based on the results and findings of the study
obtained from gathered data and interviews from the different respondents.

"ABSTRACT

Information Technology also plays important role in terms of healthcare
procedure. This paper focuses on expanding healthcare information because it
IS one of having important function in this society which could also help the
medication in much easier way. As the researcher observed, in such clinic
medication there are some of them still using manual system while the
communication technologies had a significant impact on healthcare and the
delivery of health services. Thus the technologies have the ability to create,
transmit, store and manage individualâ€™s health data. The main purpose of this
Study is to assess some medical process to adopt at least the benefits of using
technologies that can improve operational and administrative efficiencies
including clinical outcomes, documentation and information flow of a clinic
services. Furthermore, the ability for patients to obtain information to better
manage their condition and to communicate with the health system can also
improve the efficiency and quality of care. Information technology allows
healthcare providers to collect, store, retrieve, and transfer information
electronically. However adoption and benefits have not been uniformly
distributed and reliability of success has been difficult, therefore it is necessary
to improve the quality, cost, efficiency and capacity of the healthcare service.
While having the develop project been found functional, reliable, and efficient
on the total mean of 4.34 4.43 4.53 4.43 respectively. Moreover Information
technology has the potential to substantially improve healthcare by bringing
decision support to the point of care, by providing vital strategies and by
allowing routine quality measurement to become reality.

"Nowadays, the motorcycle is the primary way of transportation, and most
of the countries, especially the Philippines, are enforcing their cities to wear a
helmet when driving a bike. In Caraga Region, According to the traffic section
police station in Butuan City. Seventy-two accidents are recorded in 2017
because the person is under the influence of an alcohol. She/he is not allowed
to drive, but still, these rules are being violated, and one of the major problems
is the increasing rate of motor vehicle theft in the country. The study sought to
develop and incorporate the use of (MATH GT) A Helmet Alcohol Detection
Motorcycle Anti-Thief and GPS Tracker in riding a motorcycle. It has an
intelligent device installed in the helmet and the vehicle, using the (MATH GT)
cell phone application to operate and control the system, has a theft safety
system. It communicates with the vehicle units to switch off the ignition and
alarming system of the vehicle if there is a threat or if it is in a dangerous
situation, the helmet alcohol detector ensures that the rider is not in the
influence of alcohol with the help of the (MQ3) alcohol sensor. Using the (GPS
gf-07), the rider can be traced immediately if an accident or the motorcycle has
been stolen. This system aims to help our fellow riders ensure their safety and
assist them in their protection and motorcycle. The proponents decided to use
the Rapid Application Development model, which involves fast phase
development with an iterative process. The proponents also used Survey
Questionnaire as a tool for data gathering. The survey resulted in a mean Of

"Abstract

AFAtay: Portable Sanitation and Disinfection System for Public Vehicular
Transport Utilization is using Arduino has been developed to provide public
vehicle the automated sanitation and disinfection system and to help the
passenger in Butuan City because of the fast spreading of COVID-19. This
study focuses on sanitizing and disinfecting the way by offering the passengers
free temperature thru thermal scanner, auto hand sanitation and body
disinfection. Using the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as a method in
making the hardware was very useful and helpful in identifying errors during the
development. The following technologies like Arduino Uno, Infrared non-
contact thermal scanner, Ultra sonic sensor and Buzzer are used in making the
prototype. The proponents conducted a survey for the hardware quality of the
system to the passenger and was highly acceptable based on the total mean
obtained of 4.43. The prototype was indeed useful to the passengers because
it helps them avoid contamination and have a hygienic environment. This
eliminates the manual way of sanitizing and disinfecting hand and body of the
public vehicular transportation. It was relevant and important as per the needs
for safety and welfare of the community.

"ABSTRACT

The Smart Blind Stick is based on ultrasonic sensors and Arduino for visually
impaired individuals. People with visual impairments frequently rely on outside
assistance, which can come from humans, trained dogs, or unique electronic devices
that act as decision-making aids. As a result, we were inspired to create a smart blind
stick to help people overcome their constraints. We achieved this goal by placing
ultrasonic sensors and water sensors in strategic locations on the stick, which
activated the sound and conveyed information about the environment to the user. We
presented a low-cost, lightweight device with a microprocessor that analyses signals
and notifies visually impaired people to any obstacles, water, or dark places by using
the LED lights to enable them to be recognized by others. The system comprises
obstacle and moisture detection sensors that receive, process, and send signals to an
alarm system, which then notifies the user.

"ABSTRACT

Car-napping remained most prevalent. Car manufacturers continuously work
hard to improve the security features of their products. This is the primary reason why
most car owners nowadays decide to invest in third-party anti-theft devices to protect
their vehicles. Unfortunately, carnappers are keeping up. Motor vehicles are the
primary mode of transportation for most of us and are often an indispensable part of
our lives. Car-related thefts are among the most common offenses calling for a police
response. The lack of information regarding the location of the stolen vehicle and the
slow initial investigation time made the process of finding the vehicle difficult. The
vehicle tracking system is a complete fleet management and security solution. The
proponents came up with the idea of developing an Ad-hoc based Vehicle Tracking
System. This device will enable the users to detect the stolen vehicle at the moment
the ad-hoc tracking device pairs up. The device will send the time of detection via
message to the other device, which will be displayed on the LCD monitor of the

"ABSTRACT

The Web-based Calamity Assistance Locator is a web-based system that can
help people during calamities like earthquakes and flooding. The system can be
accessed through a smartphone connected to the internet. The user/evacuees are
required to fill in the required information and then choose the barangay where they
are registered. After registering, the user must log in and select the type of calamity,
such as a flood or an earthquake. A list of suggested areas will be shown. The
advantage of the system is that, it recognizes the health condition (c.g. with health
condition, pregnant or PWD (Person with Disability)) of the users, which allows them
to find an evacuation facility that is suitable for them, and to have a standard capacity
in every evacuation facility. Upon reservation, the user can click the button to view
the larger map, which directs the mobile device to the GPS and shows the route to the
assigned location. The minimum requirement of the mobile phone for the system Is at
least 2GB of RAM and must have an operating system (OS) version of Marshmallow
v.6.0 API level 23 or any higher version in order to have smooth and efficient

"ABSTRACT

The Fire Alarm System has been developed to provide an optimal solution for
fire spreading. This study focuses only on helping people avoid fire spreading, leading
to minor and significant injuries, and worse is death. Using the System Development
Life Cycle (SDLC) to develop the prototype enhances the development to make the
evaluation of each module easier â€” it also acts as a guide for the proponents. The
proponents used an offline system named Fire Alarm System in the prototype in sending
the predefined messages that include information of the household such as Name of the
owner, address, and Fire Level. The following electronic components and technologies
were utilized in developing the House to Fire Station communication: Arduino Uno as
the microcontroller, LCD (16 x 2 I2C), Piezo Speaker, Buttons, Breadboard, Jumper
Wires, GSM sim900a, MQ2 Gas Sensor and IR Flame Sensor. The proponents carefully
analyzed all the necessary data gathered from the internet. They surveyed to assess the
quality of the system â€” to fifty (50) respondents composed of forty-nine (49)
Households, one (1) Fire Marshal of BFP Butuan. The assessment accumulated 4.31
total mean, equivalent to highly acceptable. The device is indeed an ideal solution to
help the prevention of Fire Spreading â€” enabling the house to communicate and transmit
information towards the Fire Station.

"ABSTRACT

There is an abundance of hotel recommendation Systems available on the
Internet, such as Trivago, Grab Hostel, and Zillow Mobile. Problems arise when finding
a nearby house rental in Butuan City. Implementation of House Rental Management
System has been developed to provide an optimal solution on physically finding rental
houses and paper-based processes on managing rental houses. The system will find the
nearby house rental available, and it will make comparisons with other rental houses
for the tenants to make their choice according to the features requirement. The method
of data collection for collecting user requirements is an interview, and the source of
data for the system's functionalities is primary data. The development of the system
follows the waterfall model methodology. This system's interface is written and
designed using python, client-side scripting using JavaScript. and server-side scripting
using python. The system has three users: administrator, owner, and tenant. The
proponents carefully analyzed all the necessary data gathered from the internet and

conducted a survey to assess the guality of the system â€” to thirty (30) respondents
composed of ten (10) house rental owner, and twenty (20) house renter. The assessment
accumulated 4.47 total mean, equivalent to highly acceptable. The device ts indeed an
ideal solution to help landlords efficiently manage their information digitally and, in
return, makes it casy for the customers to scarch for houses-to-let since it helps the
landlords advertise their rental houses.

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The proponents came up with an idea of developing a DSS: Wedding
Planner Mobile Application that mainly concerns couples who plans to
organize their own wedding event and the store managements of different
wedding ideas who wants to market their businesses. It has a main objective
which is to provide suggestions from application of the different businesses
within Butuan City that provides the needs of the Customer users. The results
are based on the questions and categories that the Customers filled upon
within their respectively own personal taste of planning ideas. This mobile
application is publicly accessed by the Customer users but is not easily be
accessed by Clients or the store managements. They need to ask first to the
proponents and developers of the mobile application to negotiate their
business in order for them to have an access on it. The proponents decided to
develop it as a mobile application and not a web-based system in order for the
users to handily access the Wedding Planner Application through by using
their android phone or android gadgets anywhere and anytime. The
development of the project has a timeline of five months and through using
the Agile Method, the proponents are guided to have a proper management of

"The Mobile Classroom App for Senior High School is designed to give
advance and useful way of learning for Senior High School Students at ACLC. It

provides features that are really needed for an effective way of having a Mobile

Classroom Application.

Through this study, the researchers are well aware that there are plenty of
current existing applications that have the same features and are already used
by other schools. Hence, the researchers provided features that are not available
to other existing applications such as Checking of Attendance, Sending Message
to Parents, and Real-Time Chatting to Teachers and Students. With these
features, the researchers believes that it could really be a good help for the users
in order for them to have an easy access in doing their daily activities at school

and for the parents, they could easily monitor the students attendance in school.

To this end, the researchers therefore conclude that the Mobile Classroom

"This research entitled, â€œKnow Caraga: An Android Game Applicationâ€™ is
a promotional tool for the entire Caraga region. The core concept of the
application is to let the player choose between the three(3) categories namely,
â€œKnow Me Moreâ€ which tackles about the history or information of each
province, the second one is â€œTrulseâ€™, it is named after the combination of a
type of quiz â€œTrue or Falseâ€™, this category focuses on the artifacts that have
been found on the land, also it gives us the calendar of events that is
celebrated in each places, and the last one is the â€œCaragaâ€™s bestâ€™, it shows

the beauty of the tourist spots offered by the nature of Caraga.

After gaining up knowledge from the lessons, the game will proceed to
a different type of quizzes which depends on what category theyâ€™ve chosen.
For the category Know Caraga, you can play a fill in the blank, for the Trulse,
it is true or false, and for the Caragaâ€™s best it is a multiple-choice type of quiz.
Each quiz completed, the player will be given points that can be redeemable
at a partnered physical store. With this additional feature, the player will not

"With the new school year, the ACLC College of Butuan Library underwent
many changes including its personal and librarian, with these changes however
the institution is still using an outdated library system where its lacks many

modules that could improve its operations.

The primary objective is this project is to develop a library system that would
replace the existing system being used in the school library, the system would
address the much-needed improvements in library transactions by introducing

"ACLC Course Recommendation System is implemented to consider
the matter that ACLC of Butuan has an existing system for placement exam
but produces no results. Extra modules and functions are also executed which

are not available in the existing system.

The primary objective of this project is to support the student from
choosing course during the enrollment period. The system has the ability to
recommend courses that are appropriate for the student's skills and
knowledge. Examination is required as part of the whole course

"Grand Palace Chinese Restaurant is one of the iconic food
destinations in Butuan City. The business started in September
2011, with its building structure formed similar to a Chinese
temple with mixed modern innovation. With the mission to ensure
that each guest receives prompt, professional, friendly and
courteous service.

The essence of this system is to create a web-based
payroll system with daily time record to cater the security needs of
both the employees and the human resource in precision of time
logs records, payslip information and accessibility of information.

Grand Palace uses the manual tallying of log records and
manual calculation of salary for the employees. The system is
used to make records and to avoid impartial salary and time
recordsâ€”an honest record without any other possible inaccuracy

and to have full meticulous results of transactions.

"ABSTRACT

Genetic algorithms (GA) is an optimization technique for searching very large
spaces that models the role of the genetic material in living organisms. A small
population of individual exemplars can effectively search a large space because
they contain schemata, useful substructures that can be potentially combined to
make fitter individuals. Formai studies of competing schemata show that the best
policy for replicating them is to increase them exponentially according to their
relative fitness. This turns out to be the policy used by genetic algorithms. Fitness is
determined by examining a large number of individual fitness cases. This process
can be very efficient if the fitness cases also evolve by their own GAs. This study
was aimed to focus in creating seating pian in which lot of wedding organizers
considered as one of the difficult task in wedding planning. Genetic Algorithm have
been used in many fields of optimization the researcher believed that it can do much
more in the field of Seating Arrangement and to produce a mode! that is consisted
of optimization technique to produce a nearly optimal seating plan and presented
via 2D simulation. It has been hypothesized that Genetic Algorithm is capable of
processing the inputted name of guests and their relationships through the main
principles of biological evolution. In addition, the researcher faced many challenges
in terms of development and implementation of the algorithm to the software.
However, the result of the study shows that the researcher can produce a nearly
optima! solution through some generations of offspring that have been produced

"Andi's Snackbreak Management System was conceptualized based on
the problems encountered by the management and staff with their Traditional
Processes. The management system covers the major processes mainly:
registration of product, employee profiling, assigning employee, and
assessment of orders. The study aims to turn manual system into a modernized

one. It makes the task easier and eliminates the use of manual processing.

Based on the gathered result, the system is indeed helpful in processing
the transactions. The result was weighted through the usability test scale of the
system and the scoring was based on the mathematical standard of system
usability test scale. The proponents conclude that through the use of the
proposed Management System, the owner, who will become the admin, can
manually add, collect and retrieve products and employee information, and can

also review all transaction logs Also, the cashier can follow up and check the

"Book Indexing with Regular Expression Pattern Matching using Optical
Character Recognition - A web based book indexing system with regular
expression pattern matching and optical character recognition. This innovation
helps the librarian to share the information regarding books. The system lets
you upload the file image of back-of-the-book indexes that will be extracted
with the use of optical character recognition software called Python Tesseract
OCR Engine. This OCR engine will let you extract the text from the file image
and save into the database. This system also has a search feature that has a
pattern matching that matches the books who has a related topics. The
Proponents used the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Agile
Development Method. This model is appropriate for the development of the
system since there can be many changes throughout the development stage
of the system. When the survey was released and finished the results were
tabulated and found out that the developed system received positive
feedbacks from the respondents of the study. The developed system was
highly accepted and efficient to the users based on the total mean of 3.27
gathered from the ISO-1926-1 Survey Questionnaire. The proponents
conclude that the Book Indexing with Regular Expression Pattern Matching
using Optical Scanner will have a wide variety of knowledge to be spread and
will make the searching for books and related books be more efficient, reliable
and more advanced compared to the current manual procedures.

"An Application in Detecting Disease and Pest Infestation in Rice Plant
using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), has been developed to give
solution to the Department of Agriculture Caraga Regional Office by detecting
disease rice plant and pestâ€™s infestation in rice plant using the application. And
also, the Department of Agriculture Caraga Regional Office helps the farmers
aware of the diseases and pests attack their rice field. Furthermore, inquiry was
also included in this study to become more interactive wherein the Department
of Agriculture will help the farmers to determine their rice plant is infested with
pest and what possible disease it has. Using System Development Life Cycle
(SDLC) as a method in making the application was very useful and helpful in
identifying errors during the development. The proponents use an algorithm
which is Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that will process a photo of a rice

"Aquabot An Aquatic Microcontroller Based Floating Garbage using
Object Detection Technology has been developed to collect small pieces of
floating garbage on the water surface and to help the residents lived near in
coastal areas because many people don't pay attention in picking up garbage
on the water surface. This study focuses only on the small pieces of floating
garbage on the water surface. It has object detection to get the floating
garbage and put it into the trash bin. After collecting the garbage the sensor
will sense the weight of the garbage if it's already reaches to the maximum
load it can carry. The user can control the robot manually through the use of
RÂ¥ Controller and also the robot can identify garbage alone. The GPS serves
as a navigation to locate the starting point of the robot. Furthermore, it has
video feedback to see the collected small pieces of floating garbage. The
following technologies like Raspberry Pi 4, and Arduino are used in making
the robot. The proponent conducted a survey for the robot to the people lived
near in coastal areas was highly acceptable based on the total mean obtained
of 4.7. The robot was indeed useful to the residents who live in the coastal
areas because it helps them to collect the small piece of floating garbage to
help them in cleaning and preserve the environment. This eliminates the
manual way of collecting the garbage. It was important to be more safety and

"Ground shaking is one of the effects of an ea

the vibration of the ground during an earthquake whieh ie an Gone sbes
phenomenon. The Philippines is vulnerable to calamities because it is part of
the pacific ring of fire and most of our resources for calamity preparation are
not much on earthquake events. The shaking and moving of the ground from
earthquakes are not predictable, but it can be measured. Seismic activity, which
is the shaking of the ground, is measured by seismographs. The proposed work
is to design a system that can detect ground shaking and provide a dynamic
safety mechanism for building infrastructures. The system will estimate the local
seismic intensity of the ground shaking at the particular location of the
instrument. To determine the magnitude of the shaking the researchers used
the ADXL335 three-axis accelerometer. This sensor can measure the static
acceleration of gravity in tilt-sensing applications, as well as dynamic
acceleration resulting from motion, shock, or vibration and use Arduino UNO as
its main controller. It is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-
use hardware and software and applies the 3-dimensional vector formula to get
the seismograph reading of the shaking. It also applies the Richter scale
formula to calculate the approximate magnitude. The system provides an alarm
signal and safety mechanisms to a building like automatically opening doors
and activating guiding lights. Those dynamic safety mechanisms will trigger the
approximated threshold. Optimistically, the system should help to reduce the
number of injuries and casualties due to its capabilities during a ground-shaking
situation.

"Web Based Access Portal to Facilitate Fund Sourcing and Transaction
Management for Scholars and Sponsor has been developed to provide
scholarship for the students who are not capable in paying tuition fees or not
well enough. Also to guide potential sponsors where they can share their
blessings by supporting a student and choosing for scholarship to support.
The system is able to generate code name of the student which will be
presented to the sponsor instead of their full name. It also has four users
which is the administrator, scholar in-charge, funds in-charge and sponsor.
The study used System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as a method which
applied while developing the system. The design involves Entity Relationship
Diagram (ERD) and Data Flow Diagram (DFD) to show the logical flow for the
system. For the implementation, Apache is used as a web server, MySQL for
database, PHP Laravel as a scripting language and Google Chrome as a
browser. The proponents conducted survey for the software quality of the
system to the scholar coordinator and possible sponsors and was acceptable
based on the total mean obtained of 3.89. The system evaluation was based
from real users and the system is able to perform the task correctly.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Mobile
Classroom App for Senior High School is designed to give
advance and y j
Seful way of learning for Senior High School Students at ACLC. It

rovides fea
p tures that are really needed for an effective way of having a Mobile
Classroom Application.

Through this Study, the researchers are well aware that there are plenty of
current existing applications that have the same features and are already used
by other schools. Hence, the researchers provided features that are not available
to other existing applications such as Checking of Attendance, Sending Message
to Parents, and Real-Time Chatting to Teachers and Students. With these
features, the researchers believes that it could really be a good help for the users
in order for them to have an â‚¬asy access in doing their daily activities at school

and for the parents, they could easily monitor the students attendance in school.

To this end, the researchers therefore conclude that the Mobile Classroom

App for Senior High School was able to achieve the objective and it can be used

for future application purposes.

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The proposed Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) File Tracking System
was designed and developed according to the needs of the institution. The
researchers gathered all the requirements and information in order to develop

the proposed system.

The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) File Tracking consists of sub
systems namely the Document Management System, Monitoring and Billing
System, Record keeping, Information System, and Android Based Mobile
Smart Tracking System. These sub systems are designed for viewing the
filesâ€™ movement. Also, the proposed system can track the papersâ€™ movements

by using android application designed for viewing the filesâ€™ movement.

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The proponents came up with an idea of developing a DSS: Wedding
Planner Mobile Application that mainly concerns couples who plans to
organize their own wedding event and the store managements of different
wedding ideas who wants to market their businesses. It has a main objective
which is to provide suggestions from application of the different businesses
within Butuan City that provides the needs of the Customer users. The results
are based on the questions and categories that the Customers filled upon
within their respectively own personal taste of planning ideas. This mobile
application is publicly accessed by the Customer users but is not easily be
accessed by Clients or the store managements. They need to ask first to the
proponents and developers of the mobile application to negotiate their
business in order for them to have an access on it. The proponents decided to
develop it as a mobile application and not a web-based system in order for the
users to handily access the Wedding Planner Application through by using
their android phone or android gadgets anywhere and anytime. The
development of the project has a timeline of five months and through using
the Agile Method, the proponents are guided to have a proper management of

"Andiâ€™s Snackbreak Management System was conceptualized based on
the problems encountered by the management and staff with their Traditional
Processes. The management system covers the major processes mainly:
registration of product, employee profiling, assigning employee, and
assessment of orders. The study aims to turn manual system into a modernized

one. It makes the task easier and eliminates the use of manual processing.

Based on the gathered result, the system is indeed helpful in processing
the transactions. The result was weighted through the usability test scale of the
system and the scoring was based on the mathematical standard of system
usability test scale. The proponents conclude that through the use of the
proposed Management System, the owner, who will become the admin, can
manually add, collect and retrieve products and employee information, and can
also review all transaction logs Also, the cashier can follow up and check the
customerâ€™s order and lastly, the employee can monitor and check their pay

income daily and also access their personal information.

"The proposed ACLC Departmental Scheduling System was created
and designed to supply the needs of the client. The researchers gathered all
the data in order to develop a system which created schedules for the users
freed from hassle going to school just to look for their exam schedules.
Further saying this system is useful for the scheduler and also for the students
to determine their respected schedules. For the instructors, with their busy

schedules, they can save time looking for their exam schedule that they are
going to proctor.

The researchers aim to create an electronic system for departmental
examinations in ACLC Departmental Examination Scheduling System (ADES)
ACLC Butuan while the scheduler stands as an admin and the one who
creates the entire schedule for the departmental examination. The HR can
only view the schedule and indicate the time for the proctors. The instructor

and student can only view their schedule through the mobile app.

The researcher successfully created the system which really helps not

just for the students but also for the scheduler to view their exam schedules.

The researchers, therefore, concluded based on the testing phase that
on the studentâ€™s side, they fount out that the application is appropriate and
accessible to the students. On the other hand, teachers or instructors also

"Incident report of crime is committed by somebody that happened in
stated place where the crime occurred includes person involved or the suspect
and the crime committed. It is an unexpected and usually dangerous situation
that calls for immediate action. This project contains a detailed survey on
responding crime event in Butuan City and proposed a system to reduce
problems in reporting and responding crimes by tracing the location of the said
incident. The researchers proposed an idea to have a real-time process of
reporting crime event. This system will accept wanted person and missing
person using an application and located the place where the incident happened
using GPS and directly report to the nearest Police Outpost through SMS. The
researchers uses V-Shaped Model as their guide in creating the system. The
project begins with requirements, system design, implementation, testing and
acceptance or maintenance. Development and Evaluation of Mobile and Web-
based Application for Police Station Crime Report (DEMWAPSCR) is to be
implemented in PNP. This system will provide a new digital way of reporting
and responding crime event in Butuan City to make sure that the system is
working correctly. System Usability Test (SUS) is conducted to test the result
of the system. It consists of a 16 items questionnaire with seven response

"Mahay Elementary School Enrollment System was conceptualized
based on the ideas, problems encountered by the school staff with their
Enrollment Processes. The enrollment system covers the major processes
mainly: registration of student and employee profiling, assigning of teachers,
sectioning, assessment of fees and grading system. The study aims to turn
manual system into a computerized one. [t makes the task easier and

eliminates the use of manual processing.

Based on the result we gathered, the system is indeed helpful in
processing the transactions. The result was weighted through the usability
test scale of the system and the scoring was based on the mathematical
Standard of system usability test scale. The proponents conclude that through
the use of the proposed Enrollment System, the information and
communication technology-In charge, who will become the Admin, who
manually add, collects and retrieve studentâ€™s information, Advisers who list the
enrollees and grade students, principal who monitors the students information
and general parent-teacher association treasurer who manually do the

assessment of fees may take their advantages in order to meet their work

faster and effective.

"Grand Palace Chinese Restaurant is one of the iconic food
destinations in Butuan City. The business started in September
2011, with its building structure formed similar to a Chinese
temple with mixed modern innovation. With the mission to ensure
that each guest receives prompt, professional, friendly and
courteous service.

The essence of this system is to create a web-based
payroll system with daily time record to cater the security needs of
both the employees and the human resource in precision of time
logs records, payslip information and accessibility of information.

Grand Palace uses the manual tallying of log records and
manual calculation of salary for the employees. The system is

used to make records and to avoid impartial salary and time
recordsâ€”an honest record without any other possible inaccuracy

and to have full meticulous results of transactions.

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This research entitled, â€œKnow Caraga: An Android Game Applicationâ€ is
a promotional tool for the entire Caraga region. The core concept of the
application is to let the player choose between the three(3) categories namely,
â€œKnow Me Moreâ€ which tackles about the history or information of each
province, the second one is â€œTrulseâ€, it is named after the combination of a
type of quiz â€œTrue or Falseâ€, this category focuses on the artifacts that have
been found on the land, also it gives us the calendar of events that is
celebrated in each places, and the last one is the â€œCaragaâ€™s bestâ€™, it shows

the beauty of the tourist spots offered by the nature of Caraga.

After gaining up knowledge from the lessons, the game will proceed to
a different type of quizzes which depends on what category theyâ€™ve chosen.
For the category Know Caraga, you can play a fill in the blank, for the Trulse,
it is true or false, and for the Caragaâ€™s best it is a multiple-choice type of quiz.
Each quiz completed, the player will be given points that can be redeemable

"ACLC E-Classroom Management System is designed as a useful tool
to help the ACLC of Butuan for their learning process. It provides some
features that will improve the interaction of instructors and students during or

after class hours.

The proponents are well aware that there plenty of existing systems
that have the same functions and features that are used by other schools. In
that case, the proponents provided a feature that is not available on other
existing systems and that is the data integration of Student Information
System (SIS) and Enrollment System of ACLC so that the system will
automatically generate all the data. With these feature, the proponents
believed that it would help the ACLC of Butuan to improve the deliberation of

each class because the system will immediately assign the class sectioning.

To this end, the proponents therefore concluded that, ACLC E-
classroom Management System was able to achieve all the objectives and it

"The research in speech recognition has been intensively carried out worldwide,
spurred on by advances in signal processing, algorithms, architectures, and hardware.
Speech and text recognition systems have been developed for a wide variety of
applications, ranging from small vocabulary keyword recognition over dial-up
telephone lines, to medium size vocabulary voice interactive command and control
systems on personal computers, to large vocabulary speech dictation, spontaneous
speech understanding, and limited-domain speech translation. In this chapter we
review some of the key advances in several areas of speech and text recognition. We
also briefly discuss the requirements in designing successful real-world applications
and address technical challenges that need to be faced in order to reach the ultimate
goal of providing an easy-to-use, natural, and flexible voice interface between people

and machines.

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Technology nowadays is growing at a quick pace and it affects the
developing organizationâ€™s success. The evolution of technology plays an
important role in developing this system. ACLC Butuan is one of the growing
institutions whose faculty continues to use manual process in creating test
questionnaires. With this in mind, the researcher proposes to create a system

that will replace the manual system to provide the ACLC faculty with more

efficient service.

ACLC Test Bank is a system mainly for Dean, Program Head, Instructors
and Printing in-charge. ACLC is still using the manual process in making test
questionnaire every examination. As this problem found by the proponents, we
come up to a decision in developing the ACLC Test Banking System to provide
the instructors an easier and faster way to create test questionnaires, table of
specifications and syllabi. The instructors donâ€™t need to create new questions
and test questionnaires because it is already stored in the ACLC Test Banking

"With the use of the Android Studio and OpenCV, the proponents were
able to create an android application that can swap faces through live camera
feed. Thus, the proponents entitled it as the Android Face Swapping
Application. With the use of smart phones, camera manipulation by adding
photo effects became a trend, and from there, the face-swapping feature had
been born and the proponents have thought to study it and make their own.

Through this study, the proponents have been aware that camera
manipulation is the building block of the so-called augmented reality which is
now being studied by IT professionals today. The augmented reality has a
tremendous impact to our future because it alters reality real time. For
example, an application that analyzes signboards with foreign words and
translates it to English through a live camera feed. It is an application which
can help numerous of foreign travelers that does not know any other language
than their own. Therefore, by studying the basics of the camera manipulation,
we can improve our understanding of augmented reality and maybe in the
future, the proponents can think of an application that can be beneficial to the

community.

The Android Face Swapping Application has one major feature which
is of course, to swap faces in real time. But since Swapping two faces is too
common, the proponents decided to increase the number of faces to be
Swapped into a minimum of three faces up to five. The proponents therefore

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Technology nowadays is growing fast and it affects the developing
organizationâ€™s success. The evolution of technology plays an important role in
developing this system. ACLC Butuan is one of the growing institutions. The
finance department of ACLC still using the old Assessment and Cashiering
System with an error occurs. The proponents proposed to create new: system
which still in-line with the process of the old system to replace the old system

and eliminate those errors and boost the service of the institution to their clients.

.Assessment and Cashiering eysier with Online Queuing is a system
mainly for Accounting and Cashier Staff and Queue Administrator. The ACLC
especially in the finance department is still using the old system which the user
cannot â€˜add or save raw fees of the students in the system, there is no system
user management where the administrators can add or update users and
provide a privilege to access the system of a certain user also the system is
developed using the VB6 platform; there are compatibility issues between the
said platform and new operating systems and errors there are errors found and
the queuing system is limited only for three stations. As this problem found by
the proponents, we come up to a decision in developing the ACB Educational
Assessment and Cashiering System with Online Queuing which develop using
PHP platform to provide a new system and eliminate those errors found. This

system has user management which staff can add or update user, also it can
vi

"The proponents have decided to develop an android phone
security application that could help mitigate the increasing number of missing
phones. The descriptive method of research was used in this study. Surveys
and interviews were conducted in order to know their experiences in losing their
smartphones. The developed application is basically a mobile application which
the user can monitor their Phone if their phone is in lost mode with the help of
the features that the developer implemented. One of the objective of this study
is to develop the features in tracing and protecting your android smartphones if
ever it is stolen or gone missing and in longer term will help mitigate phone
missing cases. This will also give benefits to the users because it will somehow
lessen their worries in losing their smartphones. The proponents use a Global
Positioning System (GPS) and Google Map in their application for tracking the
lost phone and monitor it with another devices where itis registered as a backup
phone. The Proponents choose Android Operating System (aOS) in developing
the project for it has a great number people using this mobile operating system
and it is always on demand in every marketplace. The development of this
project is patterned with the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Agile
Approach. The proponents used the agile as a guide to get their goals and to

have an effective and efficient mobile application.

"ABSTRACT

Web Based Access Portal to Facilitate Fund Sourcing and Transaction
Management for Scholars and Sponsor has been developed to provide
scholarship for the students who are not capable in paying tuition fees or not
well enough. Also to guide potential sponsors where they can share their
blessings by supporting a student and choosing for scholarship to support.
The system is able to generate code name of the student which will be
presented to the sponsor instead of their full name. It also has four users
which is the administrator, scholar in-charge, funds in-charge and sponsor.
The study used System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as a method which
applied while developing the system. The design involves Entity Relationship
Diagram (ERD) and Data Flow Diagram (DFD) to show the logical flow for the
system. For the implementation, Apache is used as a web server, MySQL for
database, PHP Laravel as a scripting language and Google Chrome as a
browser. The proponents conducted survey for the software quality of the
system to the scholar coordinator and possible sponsors and was acceptable
based on the total mean obtained of 3.89. The system evaluation was based
from real users and the system is able to perform the task correctly.

Keywords: Fund Sourcing, Funds In-Charge, Scholar In-Charge, Sponsor,
Scholarship, Facilitate, Tuition Fee, Donate.

Executive Summary

ACLC Course Recommendation System is implemented to consider
the matter that ACLC of Butuan has an existing system for placement exam
but produces no results. Extra modules and functions are also executed which

are not available in the existing system.

The primary objective of this project is to support the student from
choosing course during the enrollment period. The system has the ability to
recommend courses that are appropriate for the studentâ€™s skills and
knowledge. Examination is required as part of the whole course
recommendation process. The studentâ€™s score serves as a reliable basis that

the system recommends the appropriate courses for them.

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The study is Expert System for Dish Recommendation. This is about
getting the knowledge of a dish expert or a chef and convert it into logical
machine program on how the dish expert or a chef decides after they answer
series of questions and the same thought on how the application generates dish
recipes after the user answered series of questions. This is all about cloning the

decision and translating the rules into terms that a machine can understand.

The proponents proposed to develop the Expert System for Dish

"Executive Summary

This study is conducted in order to help tourists to have an â‚¬asy access
in finding tourist spots within Surigao Del Norte. For the past years, Surigao
De! Norte doesnâ€™t have its own tourist guide application so the researchers
sought ways to create a tourist guide application exclusively in Surigao Del

Norte that can help to boost their tourism industry.

The application would locate all the tourist destination in Surigao del
Norte which includes the nature parks, landscapes and seascapes, island
adventure, religious and cultural heritage, city tours, accommodations and
other outdoor adventure such as mountain trekking and caving. Surigao Del

Norte Tourist guide with mapping also shows the description of tourist spots.

To successfully develop the Surigao del Norte Tourist Guide Application
with Mapping, the proponents need to meet the tool requirements such as
Google Maps API that allows in displaying maps in the application since the
main part of the project is about mapping, java programming language, XML,
Command Prompt (CMD), Android Studio, Firebase, XAMPP, Sublime,
android phones or tablet where an APK is installed to test and run the
application, an internet connection which helps the proponents browse over
the internet about the related Studies of the application, and laptop or

computer where the entire application is being developed, coded and build.

track of real properties available for sale. Using these systems, one can view
information on real estate properties without the need to visit the actual sites.
It also provides system administrators means to keep records of the
transactions involved in the sale of real properties.

GIS is a computer system for storing, displaying, checking related data
about the position on earth surface. GIS can show data in one map to help
people analyze and compare and differentiate the relationship of things in the
earthâ€™s terrain. It also includes locations such as farms, housing and other
relevant establishments.

The Real Estate Registration System with GIS will provide potential
buyers a means to search desired locations at a glance. This is made
possible by utilizing accurate GlS-based maps and up-to-date data from the
local Land Registration Authority. It also lifts the burden from the land sellers

processing. With the help of the GlS-based property finder, viewers can use
smartphones or tablets with browsers to easily access the site. The system

property instead of visiting personally.

exact location of property particularly in Butuan City. The system is the
response to the problem faced in some real estate management companies

"The proponents came up with an idea of developing a security system
that uses Raspberry Pi 3 due to the observations around the community which
the proponents realized that the crimes like burglary is still common in the
vicinity. According to the PNP Statistic Crime Report as of 2013, there are
around sixty nine percent (69%) crime rate that had been reported to the police
which is related to theft and burglary which makes it top of all kinds of crime

against property in the entire CARAGA.

The proponents want to develop a security system that helps the
residents, house owners, and businessmen to alarm and inform that there is an
intrusion event even if the said people are in the remote areas, and able to
receive an image that has been captured by the camera included in the security

system and can see it through android smartphone.

The proponents also want to make this study as a reference to the future
proponents who are studying in ACLC College of Butuan, who are planning to

"Many clinics are still using paper usage to record all the i
medical records of a patient and manual system in other clinical activitioe The
purpose of this study Is to address the concern and solve related problems b
developing a Polyclinic Management System which aims to Support the clinic's
daily activities. This system involves all the clinic activities Starting from
registration to billing. The system is able to generate all clinic transactions such
as reports, doctor's prescription, patient's information and medical history
medicine inventory, consultations and billings. It also has queuing and
appointment system for patients to save their time, effort, and resources.

The methods used for this study include Feature Driven Development
(FDD) and Agile Approach which is applied while developing this system. The
design involves Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and Data Flow Diagram
(DFD) to show the logical flow for the system. For the implementation, Apache
is used as a web server, MySQL as a database, PHP Laravel as a scripting
language and Google Chrome as a browser.

Furthermore, the doctor, secretary and patients will give their evaluation
and also opinions to make the system more usable for the clinicâ€™s daily activity.
Overall, this system is able to support the daily clinic operation based on
evaluation from real users and the system is able to perform the task correctly.

"The proposed ACLC Departmental Scheduling System was created
and designed to supply the needs of the client. The researchers gathered all
the data in order to develop a system which created schedules for the users
freed from hassle going to school just to look for their exam schedules.
Further saying this system is useful for the scheduler and also for the students
to determine their respected schedules. For the instructors, with their busy
schedules, they can save time looking for their exam schedule that they are

going to proctor.

The researchers aim to create an electronic system for departmental
examinations in ACLC Departmental Examination Scheduling System (ADES)
ACLC Butuan while the scheduler stands as an admin and the one who
creates the entire schedule for the departmental examination. The HR can
only view the schedule and indicate the time for the proctors. The instructor

and student can only view their schedule through the mobile app.

The researcher successfully created the system which really helps not

just for the students but also for the scheduler to view their exam schedules.

The researchers, therefore, concluded based on the testing phase that
on the studentâ€™s side, they fount out that the application is appropriate and
accessible to the students. On the other hand, teachers or instructors also
appreciated the function of the application, especially the viewing of the exam

schedules.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Aimed to develop a key dispenser with face recognition using Raspberry
pi. It employed developmental research method. There were thirty (30)
respondents utilized to evaluate the developed system. The respondents were
given questionnaire to provide information intended for evaluating the
developed system. The questionnaire was patterned after the international
Standard organization (ISO) 1926-1 software quality standard the mean was
used for computation in determining the systemâ€™s functionality, reliability,
accuracy, and security. The developed system provides a modernized and
efficient system for distributing keys. It was developed using iterative waterfall
development model techniques that employed top-down approach as a
Strategic method to the system development. The following were performed,
namely: data gathering procedures, requirement analysis, designing, coding,
testing and evaluation, and implementation. The system was found highly
functional, reliable, highly accurate, and highly secure with the total mean
obtained 4.21, 4.12,4.24, 4.39 respectively. The software quality of the system
developed a Key Dispenser with Face Recognition using Raspberry pi was

"ABSTRACT

This study is about the Solar Powered Automated Drying Rack Using
Raspberry Pi. The study is focused on developing a drying rack prototype that
would automatically hide and unhide due to rain instances. The researchers
anchored the study in Home Automation Systems Theory, thus, the study
provided two interfaces that would enable the users to automatically and
manually control the prototype. The study was conducted for the purpose of
finding a solution to the inconvenience that the raining probability gives

whenever clothes are hanged onto the drying rack in an open area. There is a
possibility that it might get wet if there is an unpredicted rain. Or, simply, no one
is around to take care of the clothes when it rains. The proponents of the study
aimed to develop a solar powered drying rack prototype that would
automatically and manually hide and unhide due to rainfall detection and
weather forecast from the internet. The newly developed system must be
evaluated in terms of functionality, reliability, efficiency and usability. By utilizing
the Waterfall Development Model Methodology, the prototype was improved,
developed and implemented into a hardware product that would benefit people
of different walks of life in a community who are too occupied to monitor their
clothes in the drying rack. In addition, it can be an efficient solution to the
inconvenience since the prototype is solar powered, hence, weather monitoring
and controlling of the drying rack can be carried out at any time of the day
without worrying about power interruption. The prototype used relevant
technologies such as Raspberry Pi 3, Rain Sensor Module and Servo Motor for
rainfall detection and mechanical control of the drying rack. In addition, the
prototype integrated mobile application to remotely control the drying rack. The
study has reached its purpose in developing a solar powered automated drying
rack prototype using raspberry pi. The researchers concluded that the
developed system is acceptable in accordance to the ISO/IEC 9126-1 Quality
Standard Model.

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Many clinics are still using paper usage to record all the information and
medical records of a patient and manual system in other clinical activities. The
purpose of this study is to address the concern and solve related problems by
developing a Polyclinic Management System which aims to support the Clinicâ€™s
daily activities. This system involves all the clinic activities Starting from
registration to billing. The system is able to generate all clinic transactions such
as reports, doctor's prescription, patient's information and medical history,
medicine inventory, consultations and billings. It also has queuing and
appointment system for patients to save their time, effort, and resources.

The methods used for this study include Feature Driven Development
(FDD) and Agile Approach which is applied while developing this system. The
design involves Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and Data Flow Diagram
(DFD) to show the logical flow for the system. For the implementation, Apache
is used as a web server, MySQL as a database, PHP Laravel as a scripting
language and Google Chrome as a browser.

Furthermore, the doctor, secretary and patients will give their evaluation
and also opinions to make the system more usable for the clinicâ€™s daily activity.
Overall, this system is able to support the daily clinic operation based on
evaluation from real users and the system is able to perform the task correctly.

"ABSTRACT

Bookista - An Electronic Library System with Augmented Reality is a web

and mobile application which makes your library experience more modern and
advance. This innovation helps the student and librarian for the easy flow of
transactions inside the library. It promotes Augmented Reality through the use
of your android mobile device. The application lets you scan the QR code of
every book then it offers not only the eBook version but also other related
books, online references and the details of the book. This web and mobile
based application is a modern innovation for the library experience of every
user. The proponents used the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) method
Iterative Waterfall Model a sequential design process for the deployment of the
processes of the system. This model is appropriate for the developed system
since itis a step by step process, because every phase of the development can
be repeated whenever there are changes along the development. When the
survey was released and finished the results were tabulated and found out that
the developed software garnered positive responses from the selected
respondents of the study. The developed system was highly acceptable and
efficient to the users based on the total mean of 4.70 gathered from the ISO-
4926-1 Survey Questionnaire. The proponents concluded that with the use of
Bookista: An Electronic Library System with Augmented Reality in the library
would make the transaction inside the library more efficient, reliable and
advance compared to the current manual processing of transaction.

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Food Shop Locator in Butuan City using Mapping Application is
designed to give an advance and useful application for people to easily find
food shops that are near and affordable for the family and love ones. Also it
provides features that are necessary for an effective way of having a Food

Shop Locator using Mapping Application.

Through this study, the researchers are well aware that there are
plenty of existing application that have the same features and are already
used by other people. Hence, the researchers provided features that are not
available in other existing application such as finding the nearest restaurant
that is affordable for the user's budget and also having to choose what food
they like. With these features, the researchers believed that it could be a
benefit help for the users in order for them to have an easy access in finding

food shops.

To this end, the researchers conclude that the Food Shop Locator in
Butuan City using Mapping Application was achieved and it can be used for

the future application purposes.

"ABTRACT

The proposed system titled Dietary: A Mobile Application For Real-
Time Food Recognition With Nutritional Facts was built with the idea of
developing an Android application that can scan raw foods and provide
nutritional facts, benefits and recommendations of the particular food item
being recognized. instead of making it in a manual way such as trying to surf
into the internet about what are the nutritional values available on the
particular raw food. Why not make it easier for the users to be aware about
the content of the particular raw food and make it easier for them in engaging
to a healthier lifestyle. The developed android application provides a useful
dietary mobile application that scans specific food item and provides healthful
information of the item being recognized also help individuals to make it
easier for them to know the nutritional facts, benefits and recommendations of
the particular food item being recognized. Which is what we need nowadays it
is because we encountered a lot of problems when it comes to our health.
The proponents used java and xml that is supported by android studio
developing environment also want to make this study as a reference to the
future proponents who are studying in ACLC College of Butuan, who are
planning to propose and make a project that is related to the Dietary: A Mobile
Application for Real-Time Recognition with Nutritional Facts and to those who
want to improve the proponentsâ€™ current project. The proponents concluded
that the projectâ€™s objective and scope are met. From the findings of the study
and data gathering of Dietary: A mobile application for real-time food
recognition with nutritional facts. It is indeed helpful for all the people to avoid
unhealthy lifestyle because of the features that can be found in the application
that can show real time giving nutritional facts, benefits and
recommendations. To those other people that are not familiar in the nutritionâ€™s
and health, this application is helpful to them with the improvement of the

healthy lifestyle. The improved of the health status of the world will go along
with it.

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Traffic Congestion Detection with Alternative Path Recommendation is
designed mainly to aid the private drivers in avoiding traffic with the use of its features

in providing real time traffic status and alternative path.

Through study, the researchers determined a number of existing applications
that have the same features and are already used by private drivers. Therefore,
researchers used the traditional transport and vehicular systems that used a V2V
communication, in which data are reliant to the users. Thus, the researchers provided
a feature that is not available to any existing application such as using a CCTV to
provide a real time traffic status and an alternative path. With these features, the
researchers believed that it could really be a good help to private drivers in order to
easily check the traffic status of a specific road, avoid traffic, and shift to routes with

less traffic congestion.

To end, the researchers therefore concluded that the Traffic Congestion

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The proponents came up with an idea ef develeping a DSS: Wedding
Planner Mobile Application that mainly seneerns cauples whe plans ig
organize their own wedding event and the siere managemenis ef different
wedding ideas who wants to market their businesses. li has a main abjective

YVUoeisSssvs:

which is to provide suggestions from application of the different businesses
within Butuan City that provides the needs of the Customer users. The results
are based on the questions and categories that the Customers filled upon
within their respectively own personal taste of planning ideas, This mebile
application is publicly accessed by the Customer users but is not easily be
accessed by Clients or the store managements. They need to ask first fo the
proponents and developers of the mobile application to negotiate their
business in order for them to have an access on it. The proponents decided te
develop it as a mobile application and not a web-based system in order for the

8 to handily access the Wedding Planner Application through by using
iheir android phone or android gadgets anywhere and anytime. The
development of the project has a timeline of five months and through using
ihe Agile Method, the proponents are guided to have a proper management of
develapment. This helps the proponents to meet the objectives, and to have a

funÃ©tianal and effective Wedding Planner Application.

"Executive Summary

This study is conducted in order to help tourists to have an easy access
in finding tourist spots within Surigao Del Norte. For the past years, Surigao
Del Norte doesnâ€™t have its own tourist guide application so the researchers

sought ways to create a tourist guide application exclusively in Surigao Del

Norte that can help to boost their tourism industry.

The application would locate all the tourist destination in Surigao del
Norte which includes the nature parks, landscapes and seascapes, island
adventure, religious and cultural heritage, city tours, accommodations and
other outdoor adventure such as mountain trekking and caving. Surigao Del

Norte Tourist guide with mapping also shows the description of tourist spots.

To successfully develop the Surigao del Norte Tourist Guide Application
with Mapping, the proponents need to meet the tool requirements such as
Google Maps API that allows in displaying maps in the application since the
main part of the project is about mapping, java programming language, XML,
Command Prompt (CMD), Android Studio, Firebase, XAMPP, Sublime,
android phones or tablet where an APK is installed to test and run the
application, an internet connection which helps the proponents browse over
the internet about the related studies of the application, and laptop or

computer where the entire application is being developed, coded and build.

"ABSTRACT

Agusan River Flood Monitoring using Raspberry Pi with SMS Advisory
has been developed to give warning and to help the residents of the affected
barangays because Butuan City was prone to flooding during rainy season.
This study focuses only on the water level detection and early warning system
(via SMS) that alerts affected residents for a potential flood event and give the
address of the nearest evacuation center in their area. Furthermore, inquiry
was also included in this study to become more interactive wherein individuals
in the community could inquire the actual water level status and the residents
can also turn on and off the SMS notification alert through SMS keyword.
Using System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as a method in making the
software was very useful and helpful in identifying errors during the
development. The following technologies like Raspberry Pi 3 B+, Ultrasonic
Sensor, and GSM are used in making the prototype. The proponent
conducted a survey for the software quality of the system to the affected
barangay and was highly acceptable based on the total mean obtained of
452. The software was indeed useful to the residents who live in the flood
prone area because it helps them evacuate early before the situation get
worst. This eliminates the manual way of detecting the water level of the flood

"ABSTRACT

An Implementation of TESDA Competency Based Training Delivery
Transaction Management System has been prepared by the proponents to
help TESDA Provincial Office on monitoring their trainers and trainee to
ensure that their trainers are doing their job accordingly. The study focused on
monitoring the trainers and trainees by means of using charts and notifying
the Provincial Office when a sudden activity has been done by the trainers
and trainees such as answering the Pre-test and Post-test. Furthermore,
automatic changes have been implemented into its charts and also if givena
change this is the first system to be used and implemented on TESDA for
monitoring their trainers and trainees. During the development the proponents
used System Development Life Cycle (SDLC), this method was very useful on
identifying errors. The Proponents used python and flask to connect on the
webpage with the side server data which is MySQL database. Python flask is
easy to call the template from the website which passed through the host and
URL to ensure the software quality, the proponents conducted a survey result
and got the result of 4.225. The result proves that the software is indeed
useful and helpful on monitoring TESDA Provincial office trainers and
trainees. Also using this System eliminates manual way of monitoring their
trainees and trainers and can rest assured that their trainers are doing their
job accordingly. The system also helps to all trainers to do work paperless
and send the data automatically to generate record of a certain trainees.

ABSTRACT

The study aimed to develop a system for monitoring fishpond with
notification component. It employed developmental research method. There were
thirty (30) respondents utilized to evaluate the developed system. The
respondents were given questionnaire was patterned after the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO 9126-1) software quality standard. Mean
was used for computation in determining the systemâ€™s functionality, reliability,
usability, efficiency, and security. The developed system provides a modernized
and efficient system for monitoring the fishpond with reporting components. It
was developed using the iterative waterfall model technique that employed
iterative as a strategic approach to the system development. The following were
performed, namely, data gathering procedures, requirements analysis, designing,
coding, testing and evaluation, and implementation. The system was found highly
functional, highly reliable, highly efficient, and highly usable. The software quality
of the developed system â€œA System for Monitoring Fishpond with Notification
Componentâ€ was acceptable to the users based on the total mean obtained of
4.44. It is therefore recommended that the system be adopted by fisherfolks.

"ABSTRACT

Pedestrian road crossings have become a major issue in road
accidents, especially in urban areas where the issue of contro! exists. To
improve the mobility between the drivers and the cross walkers, a pedestrian
lane recognition system is necessary. Pedestrian awareness is essential for
improving road safety. Hence, the proponents came up with the idea of
pedestrian recognition system aimed to recognize the presence of pedestrian
lane and automatically performs motion control to stop whenever an obstacle
or a person crossing is detected. The purpose of this report is to provide an
overview of research studies on pedestrian safety. Raspberry Pi camera
module using the method of color thresholding is used for image processing
and classifying image as pedestrian lane or not. This identifies two-
dimensional images using RGB color model that will recognize the color
preferred by the user in the camera recognition and ultrasonic sensor. The
proponents made an analysis of the peculiarities of the task of surveillance for
pedestrian crossings and presented a pedestrian recognition system. A
thorough investigation was performed on a test image in order to validate the
system's effectiveness. The efficiency of the system is affected by real-time
processing and the error rate of recognition. In general, the system helps the

people and the drivers to cross pedestrian lane in a well-organized and more
secure way.

"ABSTRACT

PayAppBus- A Cashless Payment Transaction Application for Bus
Commuters using Mobile Load Balance through Location-Based Dynamic
Fare Computation is a mobile application that makes bus commuters, bus
conductors and admin more advance. This Innovation helps the bus
commuters pay fare using mobile load balance with the help of QR code for
security purposes. It promotes PayAppBus through the use of your android
mobile device. The application lets you scan the QR code being provided by
the selected bus then wait for the next process to be conducted by the
conductor which will conduct all the information given by the bus passenger.
This mobile based application is created to modernized the flow of fare
etiquette of every bus commuter. This will help not just the bus passengers
but also the conductors and admin in making their work more secure and
fast. The developed application is highly acceptable and efficient to users.
The researchers conclude that with the use of PayAppBus- A Cashless
Payment Transaction Application for Bus Commuters using Mobile Load
Balance through Location-Based Dynamic Fare Computation would make
the transaction more efficient inside the bus station, reliable and advanced
compared to the current manual processing of fare transaction.

"ABSTRACT

Water Level and Wind Intensity Identification using Microcontroller with
Message Notification Service for Alarm and Waming System has been
developed to give waming and to help the residents of the affected puroks
because Butuan City was prone to flooding and wind storm during rainy and
windy seasons. This study focuses only on the water level detection and wind
intensity and early warning system (via SMS) that alerts affected residents for
a potential flood and wind event and give status through to the facebook
notifications. Furthermore, inquiry was also included in this study to become
more interactive wherein individuals in the community could inquire the actual
water level status and wind status where residents can also turn on and off the
SMS notification alert through SMS keyword. Using System Development Life
Cycle (SDLC) as a method in making the hardware was very useful and helpful
in identifying errors during the development. The following technologies like
Arduino Uno, Ultrasonic Sensor, Anemometer, Sim900 GSM and Network
Booster are used in making the prototype. The proponents conducted a survey
for the hardware quality of the system to the affected puroks and was highly
acceptable based on the total mean obtained of 4.52. The software was indeed
useful to the residents who live in the flood prone area because it helps them
evacuate early before the situation get worst. This eliminates the manual way
of detecting the water level of the flood and wind intensity of the wind storm and
late receiving of SMS warning of the residents. It was relevant and important as
per needs for safety and welfare of the community. The keywords are â€˜water
levelâ€, â€œwind statusâ€ and â€œall statusâ€.

Organization), the virus has now Spread to more than 20 nations and

territories around the world. The Covid19 virus spreads mainly by saliva
droplets or nose discharge.

Studies have been conducted for monitoring local residence accessing
establishments as an aid for contact tracing and data analytics; these studies
are to control the spreading of Covid-19 or known as ""CoronaVirus disease.""
Also, this study focused on the QR code that is used to access people
entering the establishments. The Proponent used Model Agile planning,
designing, planning, construction, testing, and implementation. In designing
the system, the advocates used the Agile Approach to comply with the system
specifications. If the first Step is finished, the promoter can not proceed to the

next step, but he will move backward from the previous step if there will be
any adjustments.

"ABSTRACT

A Web Portal Application for Accessing Micro Credit Records has been
developed to help lenders to view borrowers credit records especially their
previous credit from other lending company or institution. And to have
decision making for basis through credit scores as a measure of a persons
creditworthiness to identify if the borrowers are good payer or not. This study
focuses on lending company and other institution so they can easily view their
borrowers credit records with the credit score. The proponents used the
method of FICO (Fair Isaac Corporation) Credit scoring model as basis in
obtaining the credit score of the borrowers. The proponents conducted a
survey to test the developed system efficiency to the lenders as respondents

and was acceptable based on the obtained 4.07 mean average. With that, the
proponent developed a system for lenders to view their borrowers previous

credit records from other company and make decision through credit score of

"The Sanitation and Disinfection System for Cross-Border Control with Data
Collection Facility as an Aid for Contact Tracing is a system that helps the
government on contact tracing cases and preventing the spread of coronavirus
(COVID19) by providing an automated sanitation and disinfection system with
data collection feature for cross border control points. The developers were able
to create a system that collects people's personal information by scanning an
ID with a QR code, which can also be generated by the system admin and a
prototype that disinfects and sanitizes a user (border passer) with the use of
alcoho! as a mist spray. The system has a touchless information gathering
process for acquiring people's response for the covid-19 symptoms or cases
questionnaire and is answerable through voice command. After gathering the
people's information, a contactless sanitation process will then be performed
by using microcontrollers and modules designed together to work with no face-
to-face interaction needed. By conducting functionality, reliability, efficiency,
and usability test, the system garnered an â€˜Acceptableâ€™ rating category. The
system and prototype contributed to an easier and faster way of contact tracing.
Thus, the system developed was a success. However, the prototype is
applicable only for one person at a time inside the disinfection and sanitation

area.

"ABSTRACT

An Automated Canine Capture System with GPS for capturing stray
dogs on isolated or prone areas where a stray dogs usually spotted in the city
using GPS to locate and identify status of the cage. The system has two
primary functions, one is to capture the stray dog with a strong cage and
second is to notify the admin with a photo captured inside the cage when the
trap is activated and then receive a SMS message of the status of the cage
with location. Once a stray dog activated the trap the door will closed by
releasing the servo motor that holds the door of the cage. A photo will be send
to the admin website using a camera located above the cage after the trap is
activated. The admin then receives a SMS message about the status and
location of the cage using a fixed GPS location.

"ABSTRACT

An Implementation of Kemistri: An e-learning Web-based Application for
Chemical Elements has been prepared by the proponents for its goal of
developing an E-learning for chemical elements that enable teachers and
students access the study by exploring and knowing the periodic table elements
and its combinations. In addition, its purpose is to give an ease and lend help
to students specifically knowing what combinations of compounds and what will
be its result. The system can give further information based on the result of
combined elements. During the development the proponents used System
Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for this method; it is very useful in identifying
errors. The proponents used PHP language and jQuery. PHP has a general-
purpose language that is especially suited to web development on the other
hand, jQuery is a plugin for the drag and drop function of the system. The
proponents conducted a survey result and got a result of 4.225. The result
proves that the software is indeed useful and helpful to the students, also using
this system helps you save from chaos if you're having a hard time working with

computations in compounds and knowing more about it.

ABSTRACT

The study Nurse Assistant Robot: The aim of this study is to aid in the battle
against the spread of Covid-19, a new human coronavirus, in hospitals, public
transportation, airplanes, and other enclosed spaces. In this research, we used
this prototype as an agent to minimize the risk of physical contact. Since our
findings show that a mobile robot is the most successful device for inactivating
microorganisms, we created the Nurse Assistant Robot. The robot is equipped
with one ultra-sonic sensor for detecting any object that trigger and activate the
disinfectant alcohol with the specific distance. Camera to allow the nurse in
charge of the robot to see the direction as it has four wheels for mobility.
Microphone, in order for the patient to communicate with the nurse. Within the
range of the Wi-Fi link, the robot can be operated.

Keywords: Nurse Assistant Robot, Medical services, Disinfectant robot,
Motion control, Wheels, Mobile robots.

"ABSTRACT

Aquabot: An Aquatic Microcontroller Based Floating Garbage using
Object Detection Technology has been developed to collect small pieces of
floating garbage on the water surface and to help the residents lived near in
coastal areas because many people donâ€™t pay attention in picking up garbage
on the water surface. This study focuses only on the small pieces of floating
garbage on the water surface. It has object detection to get the floating
garbage and put it into the trash bin. After collecting the garbage the sensor
will sense the weight of the garbage if itâ€™s already reaches to the maximum
load it can carry. The user can control the robot manually through the use of
Rf Controller and also the robot can identify garbage alone. The GPS serves
as a navigation to locate the starting point of the robot. Furthermore, it has
video feedback to see the collected small pieces of floating garbage. The
following technologies like Raspberry Pi 4, and Arduino are used in making
the robot. The proponent conducted a survey for the robot to the people lived
near in coastal areas was highly acceptable based on the total mean obtained
of 4.7. The robot was indeed useful to the residents who live in the coastal
areas because it helps them to collect the small piece of floating garbage to
help them in cleaning and preserve the environment. This eliminates the
manual way of collecting the garbage. It was important to be more safety and

"ABSTRACT

Bill to Coin Exchanger with Notification and Security Features using
Convolutional Neural Network which makes changing bills to coin more modern
and advance. This innovation helps the people for the easy flow of transactions
when it comes to changing coins. It uses Convolutional Neural Network and
Image Processing to determine that the bill is being inserted is authentic or
counterfeit. The machine shows a User Interface which user can choose his/her
coin denomination. The proponents used the System Development Life Cycle
(SDLC) method Iterative Waterfall Model a sequential design process for the
deployment of the processes of the machine. This model is appropriate for the
developed a machine since it is a step by step process, because every phase of
the development can be repeated whenever there are changes along the
development. When the survey was released and finished the results were
tabulated and found out that the developed machine garnered positive responses
from the selected respondents of the study. The developed machine was highly
acceptable and efficient to the users based on the total mean of 4.30 gathered
from the ISO-1926-1 Survey Questionnaire. The proponents concluded that with
the use of Bill to Coin Exchanger with Security and Notification Features using
Convolutional Neural Network and Image Processing would make the

"ABSTRACT

Mobile learning is an exciting and important movement. In our ever-
changing marketplace, today pre-school students are being educated. Lergely
for jobs that has not yet been invented. The problem is that not all pre-school
students can identify objects easily. Based on the survey, teachers are
frequently used as a manual lecture, hence, the proponents decided to
develop an application for them to automatically identify and can help to the
pre-school students through this application. The proponents decided to use
the top-down approach which was essential in breaking down the modules of
e-Tudlo: A Mobile Learning Tool for Pre-School in Object Identification to gain
insight this application. The goal of this study was to provide an application
which can help or support to the pre-school students of Butuan City by means
of detecting objects immediately. The proponents gathered all the data
needed to develop an application from the pre-school students of Butuan City.
The data collected has been studied and analysed by the proponents to
determine the objectives in line with the project goals. These data serve as
the reference to design and modify the application that will be created. The
user can interact with the application through the camera. When the camera
facing to the objects, it will display information of the data and automatically
speak it out. Users require password when they want to exit the application.
The e-Tudlo: A Mobile Learning Tool for Pre-School in Object Identification

Abstract

Optimized Drunk-Driving Detection with Vehicular Motion Control
Mechanism is developed to reduce the number of vehicular accidents due to
drunk driving. This study focuses on drivers who are using four-wheeled
vehicles travelling almost everywhere accessible. The use of four-wheeled
vehicles have been increased since its first manufacture and because of this,
accidents caused by drunk-driving using these vehicles have also been rising.
In order to accomplish the main objective, the prototype detects both the
drowsiness and the alcohol intoxication of the driver using the driver's breath.
It will calculate the measurement of the eye every time itâ€™s closed or opened
with the use of the Eye Aspect Ratio to verify if the driver is drowsy or not. At
the same time, it will have the sensor to measure the alcohol content in the
driver's breath. The following technologies that are used in making the
prototype are following: Raspberry Pi 3 as the microcontroller, MQ-3 Alcohol
Sensor Module as utilized to detect alcohol in breath, Raspberry Pi Camera
used for stream and eye detection. With the use of the System Development
Life Cycle (SDLC) specifically the Iterative Waterfall Model the proponents
were able to track errors throughout the development process. Resulting from
the total mean obtained of 4.50 from the survey conducted means that the
proponents find the prototype beneficial to them. In conclusion, this study will
be helpful to the community to lessen road accidents caused by drunk-driving.

"ABSTRACT

The study is about A Geotagging and Detection System of Smokers Using
Deep Learning using Raspberry Pi 4. The study focuses on developing a
hardware device that detects smokers from the undesignated area, the
hardware device also navigates and verifies the location of the smokers. The
researchersâ€™ conducted this study for the reason that this may be one of the
solutions to the inconvenience of a secondhand smoker. Thereâ€™s a possibility
though that the percentage rate of object detection is not accurate for instance
like dark areas. The researchersâ€™ goal is to provide a hardware device that
detects people who donâ€™t abide by the smoking ban law. The hardware device
provides also navigation to the smokersâ€™ position. This hardware device entitles
A Geotagging and Detection System of Smokers Using Deep Learning must
evaluate in terms of functionality, reliability, efficiency, usability. By using the
Prototype Approach Model Methodology, the prototype developed was
improved and it can benefit the secondhand smoker from breathing the smoke
of cigarettes. Also, the hardware device is automated hardware device that can
roam around within range. This would be an efficient solution to the authorities
that is too occupied to other work. The prototype used relevant technologies
such as Raspberry Pi 4 as microcontroller, Object detection module, and Global
Positioning System for the detection of smoker and location of smoker. The
study has reached its purpose in developing A Geotagging and Detection
System of Smokers Using Deep Learning using raspberry pi.

Keywords: A Geotagging and Detection System of Smokers Using Deep

Abstract

Vehicular Locking System with Real-Time Location Monitoring using
GPS and Arduino has been developed to give locking system and monitoring
system and to help the vehicular owners in Butuan City because of the fast-
growing populating of vehicle owners. This study focuses on locking,
monitoring and give messaging command (via SMS) that communicate with
the vehicular owner to update the vehicle owners from theft or unwanted
access to the vehicle. Furthermore, an inquiry was also included in this study
to become more interactive wherein individuals in the community could
inquire the actual vehicle status and the owners can also turn on and off the
SMS notification alert through SMS keyword. The vehicle can be monitored
through the web application. Using the System Development Life Cycle
(SDLC) as a method in making the software was very useful and helpful in
identifying errors during the development. The following technologies like
Arduino Uno, GSM and Buzzer are used in making the prototype. The
proponents conducted a survey for the software quality of the system to the
vehicular owners and was highly acceptable based on the total mean
obtained of 4.1956. The prototype was indeed useful to the vehicular owners
because it helps them to monitor the vehicle in the situation if someone elseâ€™s
in the family used it. This eliminates the manual way of locating the vehicle
real-time and late receiving of SMS warning of the vehicular owners. It was
relevant and important as per the needs for safety and welfare of the

"ABSTRACT

The prototype Whohan: A Social Distancing and Face Mask Detection in a
Close Area Setting for Covid-19 Prevention. The study focuses on developing
a software image processing that uses camera that could implement the health
protocols in order to prevent the potential risk of spreading corona virus. The
proponentâ€™s goal is to provide safety for remote and far-flung town and villages
that do not have stable internet connection. This help school in regulating and
implementing health protocols. The camera detects and remind people
(students) who didnâ€™t wearing mask and violating social distance. This also
provide documentary reports of violators for evidence purposes. The Whohan:
A Social Distancing and Face Mask Detection in a Close Area Setting for Covid-
19 Prevention is evaluated in terms of functionality, reliability, efficiency and
usability. The proponents reached its aim in developing Whohan; a software

which uses OpenCV and Keras/Tenserflow.

"ABSTRACT

Automated Aqua Scape Tank (IOT) using Raspberry Pi has been
developed to give an aid specifically for the people who have pet shops and
handle large amounts of different animals to minimize their tasks and to
individuals who love to keep a fish but do not have enough time. This study
focuses only on the water level detection, water toxicity detection, and
automatic feeding of fishes. Furthermore, notification systems (via SMS) were
also included in the study to be more interactive wherein the pet owner will
receive a message whenever the water level in the fish tank decreases and
also will receive a message whenever the fish food container is empty. It is for
the owner to be notified. The Raspberry Pi has been chosen to be used as a
microcontroller in gathering information from the water level sensor and pH
sensor and mechanically control the aqua scape tank. The proponent
conducted a survey for the software quality of the system to the pet shop
owners and other individuals who are petting a fish in a tank. The software was
indeed functional because it helps them to feed and care for the fishes inside
the tank in the owner's absence. This study also eradicates the manual way of
changing the water whenever it becomes dirty and deadly for the fishes.

"ABSTRACT

A Microcontroller Based System for Object Disinfection and Sanitation
using Object Detection Technology has been developed scan the item with the
help of camera. The system detects automatically detect the item and
categories as food, non-food, fresh food. The System had a conveyor that
would help the system to allocate item in the proper disinfection and sanitation
section. It used variety type of disinfection and sanitation tools and materials
such as Ultraviolet light, Ultrasonic Mist Maker Humidifier and Sanitizer Spray
alcohol 98% solution. Disinfect and sanitized are the possibility of inactivating
viral, bacterial, and fungal aerosols in a chamber-type air disinfection system
by using an Ultraviolet light array treatment effectively inactivated viral
infectivity, the highest ultraviolet susceptibility, represented by the inactivation
rate consiant, was calculated for bacteria, followed by fungi and viruses. The
following technologies like Raspberry Pi, Arduino Uno, Ultraviolet light,
Conveyor, Pi Camera, water sensor, Buzzer, Wiper DC Motor, Humidifier and
Relay are used in making the prototype. The researcher used the survey
questionnaire tool to examine the concept and capabilities for the prototype
according to the !SO-9126-1 software quality characteristics was highly
acceptable based on the total mean obtained of 4.7. The prototype was indeed
useful to the people because it helps them to sanitize the food, non-food and

"ABSTRACT

A Learning Management System is timely and relevant to Alternative
Learning System Schools or ALS. It provides students and teachers a virtual
access to their classes. The students can view lessons, take quizzes and
exams and submit their work online, while the teachers can upload files for
lessons, organized the content of a certain course like quizzes or exams and
evaluation of students. Also teachers and students can communicate with each
other for some clarifications. In this study, the proponents introduced the
ALStudy: A Learning Management System for Alternative Learning System
Schools intended only for the ALS community. It gives the students and
teachers a modern learning tool through virtual classes that is convenient to
their time. The most used LMS nowadays are Moodle and Google Classroom
but most of the LMS was developed for formal basic education. Since there are
lots of LMS as of now the proponents decided to developed a project that is
different from others, the ALStudy takes advantage of existing LMS features
but focusing only for ALS, following their class structures and curriculum.

"ABSTRACT

Human-computer interaction innovation is one of the biggest trends in
the IT field oF the IT industry. But despite our technological advancements, it
ig still a big challenge to create innovations that can suffice and address the
needs to improve human-computer interaction. One of main methods to
address this dilemma ig using natural language processing. Rule-Based (RB)
approach for Natural Language Processing (NLP) uses series of â€œif-thenâ€
statement to analyze and understand natural human language. With the help
of speech utterance driven platforms to capture the voice input which is
specified into imperative statement only. With the objectives to create a model
that can analyze and understand voice command inputs. The study is
implemented in solving basic algebraic problems which became an essential
part of the study for it gives a clear result of the approach in comprehending
human language utterances. The researchers encountered numbers of
challenges throughout the development and implementation of the RB
approach for NLP into an android application. However the results were all
promising, the researchers can produce a correct analyzation of the voice

command in relative to the correct solution and answer to the basic algebraic

problems given.

"ABSTRACT

This paper is focused on the recognition of the American Sign

Language, being the predominant sign language among the Deaf

communities worldwide, Addressing the problems on the cost and

comfortability of wearing the assistive hardware tools, the researchers

Propose an approach that does not need the use of assistive hardware

technologies for hand gesture recognition. In addition, this study will apply the

OpenPose library for the pose estimation and the Hidden Markov Model for
the learning process. Ten (10) common phrases that are more likely to be
used in a day to day interaction are used in this study, serving as the state
sequences. By performing three experiments with a total of 75 testing tries
each and done by training one (1), two (2), and four (4) data set entry per
state sequences on random tries, there is 0% accuracy in the first experiment,
1.44% and 28% in the second and third experiment. From these results, the
researchers conclude that the accuracy of recognizing the signs depends on
how well the data set is trained. In order to have more accurate recognition, a
large amount of dataset per state sequence will be needed. By implementing
the OpenPose for the pose estimation process and the HMM for the
Classification method, the prototype is able to recognize and translate fifteen
(15) words from the ten (10) ASL phrases and can also output phrases given

that it can be found in the trained transition probability values.

"ABSTRACT

This study aimed to develop an effective and efficient Automated Class
Scheduling System of ACLC College of Butuan specifically in the Information
Technology Education (ITE) department to help minimize the ITE Deanâ€™s
problems in scheduling classes for both students and the faculty. The researchers
identified hard and soft constraints to determine the conditions in making the
system. An algorithm to solve timetabling problems such as conflicts of schedules

was developed.

In developing the system, the researchers adapted the Systems
Development Life-Cycle (SDLC) phase concept which is used to describe
functional systems development activity and to gain control of the complexities of
the systems development. The System Development Life-Cycle (SDLC) was
tailored to the study environment that led to the successful development of the

system.

After developing the system, the survey method was adapted in order to
determine and evaluate the user acceptance of the system. A survey questionnaire
was answered by random respondents. According to the results gathered by the

ABSTRACT

Entry to utility rooms where the use has oriented with people is necessary
to be automated for the optimum solution of delays and access failures due to
misuse of room keys. Automated doors are no new for post-modern era with the
advent of remote signal-triggered devices. Radio Frequency Identification
Systems is the most used system of signal communication nowadays. This study

rotates the idea of time-permission to enter rooms, with the use of Role-Based
Access Control methods of regulating access, the mode of permission and
restriction to access the computer Laboratory in ACLC brings into its optimum

level from manual keying to swiping of RFID cards.

"Abstract

A transcompiler that takes one source code as input will be read and
transcompiled to produce the equivalent HypterText Markup Language, Cascading
StyleSheet, JavaScript and PHP Hypertext Preprocessor as target output source
codes. It is made as an alternative computer language for developing web pages
without the need to learn two or more computer languages. In order for the
transcompiler to generate the equivalent source codes, it has defined syntax rules or
grammar that should be followed. The process of generating the target source passes
through phases as where it will be read character by character to form tokens, parsed
and symbol table managed. The tokens extracted from the source will or should follow
the syntax grammar for the transcompiler to interpret and generate the equivalent

"ABSTRACT

Android smart phone is one of the fast growing mobile phones and because of

these it the one of the most preferred target of malware developer. Malware apps can

penetrate the device and gain privileges in which it can performs malicious activities such

reading user contact, misusing of private information such as sending SMS and can harm

user by exploiting the users private data which is stored in the device. This study is about

implementation of detecting malwares on android applications, which would be the basis

of all future development regarding malware detection. The main reason why the
researchers came up with this study is that majority of the smartphone users worldwide
are not aware of the permissions as the basis of all malicious activities that could possibly
operate in an android system and may steal personal and private information .Android
operating system is open system in which users are allowed to install application from
any unsafe sites. However permission mechanism of and android system is not enough
to guarantee the invulnerability of the application that can harm the user. In this paper we
propose a permission scoring-based analysis that will scrutinized the installed permission
and allows user to increase the efficiency of Android permission to inform user about the
risk of the installed Android apps. In this paper we propose a framework that would
Classify the level of sensitivity of the permission access by the application. The framework
use a formula that will calculate the sensitivity level of the permission and to determine if
the installed application is malicious or not. Our result show that, in a collection of 26

malicious application, the framework is able to correctly determine the application's

"Abstract

This study is about Traffic Congestion Detection (TCD) System using
Computer Vision. The reason the researchers come up with this idea is due to
minimal existence of studies that focuses on object detection specifically on
cars in using Cameraâ€™s perspective. Thus, using it in situation such as traffic
congestion is very unique. Hence, if this study will be used in real world, this
could help police or highway authorities gave surveillance and immediate
realtime notifications on traffic congested areas. Moreover, TCD system using
Computer Vision uses relevant technology such as Camera or Closed Circuit
Television to perform automatic object detection (cars) with the help of Open
Source Computer Vision (OpenCV). Then, identify traffic congestion involving
cars that occurs with the used of 2D collision algorithm. Lastly, the TCD
system will display realtime information (realtime status of traffic congestion
occured, No. of cars that are detected, the date and time, the camera no. or

"Abstract

A transcompiler that takes one source code as input will be read and
transcompiled to produce the equivalent HypterText Markup Language, Cascading
StyleSheet, JavaScript and PHP Hypertext Preprocessor as target output source
codes. It is made as an alternative computer language for developing web pages
without the need to learn two or more computer languages. In order for the
transcompiler to generate the equivalent source codes, it has defined syntax rules or
grammar that should be followed. The process of generating the target source passes
through phases as where it will be read character by character to form tokens, parsed
and symbol table managed. The tokens extracted from the source will or should follow
the syntax grammar for the transcompiler to interpret and generate the equivalent

"ABSTRACT

Pharmacists who read medical prescriptions and administer medicine to
the patients tend to carry the responsibility for any error that may occur
therein. Creating a prototype application with the appropriate pre-processes,
segmentation techniques, and word recognition that will assist them in reading
illegible handwritten medical prescriptions will help make their life easier. The
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been used in studies to decipher
characters and identify the handwriting. Two of its forms are the Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which are
primarily used to solve difficult image-driven pattern recognition tasks. Their
precise yet simple architecture offers a simplified method of getting started
with ANNs. The system follows the following processes for the application of
the handwriting recognition system: 1) image acquisition, 2) image filtering, 3)

word and line segmentation, and 4) segmented word recognition. However,

the following processes proved to be difficult with the unforeseen problems

that occurred during the development phase. Nonetheless, through in-depth

comprehension of how the Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks

work in handwriting recognition, the researchers proved that the study is

promising for further development.

"Abstract

This study is about Traffic Congestion Detection (TCD) System using
Computer Vision. The reason the researchers come up with this idea is due to
minimal existence of studies that focuses on object detection specifically on
cars in using Cameraâ€™s perspective. Thus, using it in situation such as traffic
congestion is very unique. Hence, if this study will be used in real world, this
could help police or highway authorities gave surveillance and immediate
realtime notifications on traffic congested areas. Moreover, TCD system using
Computer Vision uses relevant technology such as Camera or Closed Circuit

Television to perform automatic object detection (cars) with the help of Open
Source Computer Vision (OpenCV). Then, identify traffic congestion involving
cars that occurs with the used of 2D collision algorithm. Lastly, the TCD
system will display realtime information (realtime status of traffic congestion
occured, No. of cars that are detected, the date and time, the camera no. OF

ID) based on the incident using Java (Programming Language).

"ABSTRACT

Human-computer interaction innovation is one of the biggest trends in
the IT field or the IT industry. But despite our technological advancements, it
is still a big challenge to create innovations that can suffice and address the
needs to improve human-computer interaction. One of main methods to
address this dilemma is using natural language processing. Rule-Based (RB)
approach for Natural Language Processing (NLP) uses series of â€œif-thenâ€™â€
statement to analyze and understand natural human language. With the help
of speech utterance driven platforms to capture the voice input which is
specified into imperative statement only. With the objectives to create a model
that can analyze and understand voice command inputs. The study is
implemented in solving basic algebraic problems which became an essential
part of the study for it gives a clear result of the approach in comprehending
human language utterances. The researchers encountered numbers of
challenges throughout the development and implementation of the RB
approach for NLP into an android application. However the results were all
promising, the researchers can produce a correct analyzation of the voice

"ABSTRACT

Pharmacists who read medical prescriptions and administer medicine to
the patients tend to carry the responsibility for any error that may occur
therein. Creating a prototype application with the appropriate pre-processes,
segmentation techniques, and word recognition that will assist them in reading
illegible handwritten medical prescriptions will help make their life easier. The
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been used in studies to decipher
characters and identify the handwriting. Two of its forms are the Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which are
primarily used to solve difficult image-driven pattern recognition tasks. Their
precise yet simple architecture offers a simplified method of getting started
with ANNs. The system follows the following processes for the application of
the handwriting recognition system: 1) image acquisition, 2) image filtering, 3)
word and line segmentation, and 4) segmented word recognition. However,
the following processes proved to be difficult with the unforeseen problems
that occurred during the development phase. Nonetheless, through in-depth
comprehension of how the Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks
work in handwriting recognition, the researchers proved that the study is

promising for further development.

"ABSTRACT

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently exhibited state-of-
the-art performance with respect to image recognition tasks. In this study, we
adopt digital image of bacteria with CNNâ€™s. To begin the structure of this thesis
we gather information of bacteria from profession microbiologist. Deep learning
refers to the branch of machine learning that is based on learning levels of
representation. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is one kind of deep
neural network, the system is composed of different characteristic of algorithms
which each algorithm has its own function but to sum up and calculate a unique
prediction. We propose a feature visualization method that is suitable for the
proposed training scheme, assuming that all of the images from a macroscopic
angle image. To run through the image into trained data, test data, and
validated data. We find an optimized size of the representative volume element
to ensure the prediction accuracy of the CNNs, providing useful guidance in
preparation for the training set. After each epoch pass through our data, it could

determine the highest accuracy as the result.

"ABSTRACT

Covid-19 started in Wuhan, China, last December 2019 and has
spread all over the world. One of those affected by covid-19 is the Philippines,
especially in the Caraga region. From March 2020 until the current month of
2021, there has been a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases. That's why the
proponents developed a system named ""Predicting covid-19 outbreak through
data analysis using simple linear regression,"" by using the Simple Linear
Regression it allows to computes the total of Death, recovered, and infected
cases also Predict the possible count of infected, recovered, and deaths for
the following month of the Covid-19 in Caraga with the accuracy level of
1707% in infected, 1646.5% in Recovered, and 634% in Death in a whole
month. The proponents used the MAD, APE, and MAPE to test and evaluate
the model's accuracy. The system aimed to address the alarming rate of
changing growth of Covid-19 result every month. The proponents conclude
that with in-depth research using sufficient data and the right tools for
development, the system can improve and potentially help the community,
hospitals, and healthcare organizations.

"ABSTRACT

The implementation of knowledge discovery, commonly referred to as
data mining, has been considered a latent solution for the containment of the
COVID-19 pandemic. The proponents developed a prototype symptom-
monitoring web application as a helping tool for the concerned individuals who
may have been exposed to COVID-19. By integrating Apriori Algorithm and
Naive Bayes Classifier; Apriori Algorithm to mine association rules to predict
the following occurring symptom based on confidence percentage, and Naive
Bayes Classifier to analyze and predict the individual's risk exposure based on
her/his details, the prototype system discovered that the highest risk exposure
with 64% was if the individual was working on the frontline (frontliner) and the
symptoms such as fever, cough and sore throat are the common sequence of
indication with 56% confidence of risk exposure. The system aimed to address
the alarming concern of being exposed to the virus due to manual monitoring,
offer a platform for the individuals to track their symptoms within the entire
seven-day monitoring course and produce data-driven predictions to give
insights about the risk level of COVID-19 exposure. The proponents believe
that with intensive research using sufficient data and the right tools for

development, the prototype can become a potential tool to aid the community
and healthcare organizations.

"Covid-19 started in Wuhan, China, last December 2019 and has
spread all over the world. One of those affected by covid-19 is the Philippines,
especially in the Caraga region. From March 2020 until the current month of
2021, there has been a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases. That's why the
proponents developed a system named ""Predicting covid-19 outbreak through
data analysis using simple linear regression,"" by using the Simple Linear
Regression it allows to computes the total of Death, recovered, and infected
cases also Predict the possible count of infected, recovered, and deaths for
the following month of the Covid-19 in Caraga with the accuracy level of
1707% in infected, 1646.5% in Recovered, and 634% in Death in a whole
month. The proponents used the MAD, APE, and MAPE to test and evaluate
the model's accuracy. The system aimed to address the alarming rate of
changing growth of Covid-19 result every month. The proponents conclude
that with in-depth research using sufficient data and the right tools for
development, the system can improve and potentially help the community,
hospitals, and healthcare organizations.

"ABSTRACT

Android smart phone is one of the fast growing mobile phones and because of
these it the one of the most preferred target of malware developer. Malware apps can
penetrate the device and gain privileges in which it can performs malicious activities such
reading user contact, misusing of private information such as sending SMS and can harm
user by exploiting the users private data which is stored in the device. This study is about
implementation of detecting malwares on android applications, which would be the basis
of all future development regarding malware detection. The main reason why the
researchers Came up with this study is that majority of the smartphone users worldwide
are not aware of the permissions as the basis of all malicious activities that could possibly
operate in an android system and may steal personal and private information .Android
operating system is open system in which users are allowed to install application from
any unsafe sites. However permission mechanism of and android system is not enough
to guarantee the invulnerability of the application that can harm the user. In this paper we
propose a permission scoring-based analysis that will scrutinized the installed permission
and allows user to increase the efficiency of Android permission to inform user about the
tisk of the installed Android apps. in this paper we propose a framework that would
Classify the level of sensitivity of the permission access by the application. The framework
use a formula that will calculate the sensitivity level of the permission and to determine if
the installed application is malicious OF not. Our result show that, in a collection of 26
Malicious application, the framework is able to correctly determine the application's
behavior consistently and efficiently.

â€œAUTOMATED COURSE SCHEDULING USING LOCAL
SEARCH BASED SEARCH TECHNIQUE ALGORITHMâ€

A timetabling is a method of assigning events into a limited number of time
period and must satisfy a set of constraints of various types, which involve, among
others, avoiding the overlap of events with common participants, and not excessing
the capacity of rooms. These constraints are broken into two categories: soft and
hard constraints. Hard constraints are constraints, of which, in any occupied
timetable, there will be no breaches. Soft eoustraints are constraints which may be
shattered, but of which breaches must be minimized. In addition to constraints,
there are a number of exceptions which must be taken into consideration when
constructing an Automated Timetabling System. The College timetabling is a
special type of timetabling which is includes course timetabling or course
scheduling and examination timetabling.

The Course Scheduling Problem (CSP) is concerned with assigning a
number of courses to classrooms while taking into consideration constraints like
teacher and students preferences, classroom capacities and college rules and
conditions. The problem also attempts to optimize the performance criteria and
distribute the courses fairly to classrooms depending on the ratio of classroom

capacities to course enrolments. The difficulty in CSP is due to the various
associated constraints that need to be satisfied in order to produce better schedules.
A number of solution methods, analytical or heuristic approach, have been

proposed to solve the CSP.

In this research, timetabling system will resolve the (CSP) that academic
institutions face every year. By the use of an improved algorithm that significantly
produces better optimization results, conflicts will be prevented. The automated
scheduling system provides a choice of feasible schedules and solutions in which
examinations are well spread out for most students. It handles requirements
regarding the proximity of a student's courses, room or time availability, and other
factors. With the automated system, considerable reduction in clerical efforts is
attained. This can relieve the decision-makers from the burden of tedious and time-

"ABSTRACT

Pam is a spoken dialogue system aimed to help college students deal with
distress. Pam uses natural language processing to understand the user speech.
It uses Automatic Speech Recognizer (ASR) to receive the phonetics input. The
ASR processes the phonetics data to generate a text which it passes to the
Dialogue Manager (DM). The DM processes the text in order to formulate a
sentence as an output. The dialogue manager has phases, the Lexical, Parsing
and Discourse. Where in the lexical phase, the data is being tokenized or
chunked as a preparation for the next phases. The next process is part of speech
tagging or POS-tagged. In here, the data that are being chunked are labeled with
corresponding POS-tag. The next phase is parsing. With the help of parsing the
sentence structure is being check as a part of syntactic analysis to generate an
abstract tree. The abstract tree is used in semantic analysis to come up the best
possible meaning that the user tries to convey. From parsing, the data undergo
in discourse to check the previous input if it has a connection. As the meaning of
the sentence is identified, it passed to the next phase which is the Inference

Engine, where it generates a logical result with the help of logical test. The data

from IE is passed to TTS module to finally deliver an audible output.
